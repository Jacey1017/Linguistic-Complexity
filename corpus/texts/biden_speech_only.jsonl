{"Title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News", "Date": "2021-03-16", "Text": "Well, first of all, I won't even be able to meet the July 4th deadline unless people listen, wear masks, wash their hands and socially distance because not everyone by July 4th will have been vaccinated. There's enough vaccine -- I -- we-- we've been able to purchase enough vaccine, George, with a lotta -- a lotta heavy liftin' for over six hundred -- well over 600 million doses to take care of more than 300 million Americans, some of 'em single dose.\nBut I hope that what I'm reading about 30% of Republican men say they won't get the vaccine and people are talkin' about whether they ne-- I mean, you have to-- one, when-- when it's available to, get the vaccine, number one. Number two, stay socially distanced. Number three, wear a mask when you're out in public. And we'll get by this and we'll get by it much quicker than we otherwise --\n-- would.\nI have no idea what kind of influence he has anymore. I'm not bein' facetious. I just don't know, George. He got the vaccine. He got the vaccine before he -- he left Washington. And so I hope people understand. Now, one of the hardest things we're doin', George, is in communities not far from here, there's a lot of poor communities that don't have access to a lot of opportunities. They've been hit very hard by the COVID experience.\nThey've been dying at -- at more rapid rate when they contract it. They contract at a more rapid rate than the white community. And that's why we opened up to tens of thousands of drug stores across the country because there's many in almost every neighborhood, and federal health clinics that are in the areas, that are in the most hard-hit areas. So we gotta reach out and make sure people who either don't have computers, don't know how to get online -- that they're able to get the vaccine.\nI honest to God thought we had it out. I honest to God thought that, once we -- we guaranteed we had enough vaccine for everybody, things would start to calm down. Well, they have calmed down a great deal. But I don't quite understand, you know, the sorta -- I don't wanna -- I just don't understand this sort of macho thing about, \"I'm not gonna get the vaccine. I have a right as an American, my freedom to not do it.\" Well, why don't you be a patriot? Protect other people.\nWell, it's changed because I can hug my grandkids now. They come over to the house. I can see them. I'm able to be with them. I've had the vaccine. I've had it. And, secondly -- it has changed my life in the sense that I've been able to demonstrate to other people that, you know, I mean, I doubt whether people would expect me to take it if I didn't think it was safe -- to make the case that it is safe to take the vaccine. It's important to take the vaccine.\nWell, first of all, there was a surge the last two years. In '19 and '20 there was a surge as well.\nNo, well, it could be. But here's the deal. We're sending back people to -- first of all, the idea that Joe Biden said, \"Come\" because-- I-- I heard the other day that they're coming because, you know, I'm a nice guy and I won't do what --\n-- Trump did. Yeah. Well, here's the deal. They're not. The adults are being sent back, number one. That's number one. Number two, what do you do with an unaccompanied child that comes to the border? Do you repeat what Trump did?\nTake them from their mothers, move them away, hold them in cells, etcetera? We're not doin' that. So what we're doin' is we have brought in -- brought in HHS and also brought in FEMA to provide for enough safe facilities for them to not -- to get out of control of the Border Patrol, which was not designed to hold people for long periods of time, particularly children.\nGet them out of those facilities. And most of them come with a phone number too -- so what we're doing is we're putting together an entire organizational structure so that, within seven days, they're gonna be able to get on the phone, contact that number, find out whether there is a mother or a father, whether it is safe, whether it is a secure circumstance to get the child to that adult.\nWell, what you get -- what you have to do is you have to try to get control of the mess that was inherited. And the way to get control of the mess that was inherited -- I mean, look, here's what the plan is. You may remember when we had this unaccompanied children at the border when Barack was president, he called me back, I was in Turkey and said, \"You gotta take care of this.\"\nAnd I was able to get a bipartisan bill passed for almost $800 billion to go to the root cause of why -- why people are leaving. Why are they leaving El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras? Because they're in terrible circumstance, either because of natural disasters and hurricanes, gangs or violence.\nThey're tryin' to escape. And that's why they're coming. So what I did, I spent close to 100 hours with the leaders of those three countries and the U.N. making sure that we're -- for example, in one of the major cities down there, they said the crime rate's terrible. That's why people are leaving this particular city.\n\"But we have no street lighting.\" And the government said, \"Give us the money to put in --\" I said, \"I'm not gonna give you the money. But I'll tell you what. Show me what you need. I'll get contractors down there. We'll put in the street lights for you,\" because there's a lotta corruption down there. And guess what? Violence came down in that city.\nYes. I can say quite clearly don't come over. And the process of getting set up, and it's not gonna take a whole long time, is to be able to apply for asylum in place. So don't leave your town or city or community. We're gonna make sure we have facilities in those cities and towns run by department of -- by DHS and also access with HHS, the Health and Human Services, to say you can apply for asylum from where you are right now.\nMake your case. We'll have people there to determine whether or not you are able to meet the requirement you qualify for asylum. That's the best way to do this. In addition to that, while we also change the circumstances on the ground in those communities, you're gonna diminish the reason why people want to leave in the first place.\nIt's not like someone's sitting in Guadalajara right now in Mexico, which is not the biggest problem right now, and saying, \"I got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, give him our kids, take 'em across the border. Leave 'em in a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun?\"\nThat's not why people come. They come because their circumstance is so bad. Now, some come because they want a better opportunity, for economic reasons. They don't qualify. And so in the meantime, what we should be doing is making sure we provide beds for these children.\nBy the way, over 50 percent children coming are ages 16 and 17. 16 and 17. They're not -- most of 'em are not little babies. 1% are young -- young kids. And so what we're doing now is we're providing for -- in the past, what you do is HHS would take them to licensed providers, so there's beds, security, where there's health care, they're fed, they're cared for, while they determine whether or not there is someone in the United States they're entitled to go to.\nAnd that's what we're in the process of doing now. We will have, I believe, by next month enough of those beds to take care of these children who have no place to go. But they need to be taken care of while they're -- but the vast majority -- let's get somethin' straight though. The vast majority of people crossin' the border are being sent back. Are being sent back, immediately sent back.\nWell, look, one of the things that, if you notice the criticism of the COVID relief package from my Republican friends, is they say it spends too much money and it gives too many tax breaks. Well, 60% of all these tax breaks go -- all these tax breaks go to the bottom 60% of the population.\nAnd guess what? They need it. The $1,400 check. Child care tax credit, the ability to provide for -- we cut child poverty in half, literally in half in the United States of America. They don't like it because in fact their -- their idea of a tax cut is give the Trump tax cut, where 83% went to the top 1% of the people in America.\nYes. Anybody making more than $400,000 will see a small to a significant tax increase. If you make more than -- less than $400,000, you won't see a fed -- one single penny in additional federal tax. I brought this with me 'cause I often get asked and I don't wanna misquote it.\nIf you take a look at the corporate tax rate under Trump, if you raise the tax rate back up to what we thought it should be, it was at 35%, they brought it down to 21%. Bring it to 28%. That raises $800 billion. You have now 90 of the Fortune 500 companies don't pay a single penny in federal tax. Not a penny. Making billions of dollars.\nOh, I may not get -- but I'll get the Democratic votes for a tax increase. And -- there're some Republicans who do have consc -- look -- also, we know, if we just took the tax rate back to what it was when Bush was president, top rate paid 39.8 per se -- 39.6% in federal taxes. That would raise $230 billion.\nYet, we're -- they're complaining because I'm providing -- a tax credit for child care? For the poor, for the middle class? Keeping people -- and by the way, my proposal in the relief plan I put forward, it creates seven million jobs according to a whole range of people, including -- Moody's and Wall Street, number one. Increases the GDP by over $1 trillion, actually raises -- raises income in America, and diminishes debt in America. I mean, what are these --\nYes. But here's the choice. I don't think you have to eliminate the filibuster. You have to do it what it used to be when I first got to the Senate back in the old days when you used to be around there. And that is that a filibuster -- you had to stand up and command the floor.\nAnd you had to keep talkin' along. You couldn't call for, you know -- no one could say, you know, quorum call. Once you stopped talkin', you lost that and someone could move in and say, \"I move the question of.\" So you gotta work for the filibuster.\nI am. That's what it was supposed to be. Look, I think -- don't hold me to the numbers, George, but I think between 1960 and 2000, there were l -- I'm makin' this number up. I don't know. There were, like -- you know, 50 filibusters. Now there're, like, 200 since then, since that rule tanked --\nYeah. I mean, you know, so the idea -- it almost is gettin' to the point where there's -- you know, democracy's having a hard time functioning. A hard time functioning. And so, look, I'm not sayin' this is gonna be easy, George. But I do believe there's enough Republicans over time who are gonna have -- look, you -- you --\nNo, no. Well, I've only been here six weeks, pal, okay? Gimme a break. (LAUGH) Been here six weeks. I think the epiphany's gonna come in twenty -- between now and 2022. There's 78% of the people say they support this program. 52% of Republicans.\nLet's assume it's off by 15%. You're gonna go home and cap a -- Republican voters want that $1,500 because they're in trouble. Republican voters want to be able to choose between being able to send their -- go to work and send their kid to a daycare that they can afford.\nRepublican voters wanna be able to take care of a child care tax credit. I mean, these are -- it's not like -- every Republican is you know, a billionaire. You know, they're -- by the way -- I'm not saying it will cha-- I'll do it again, but I want those Republican voters in suburbia.\nHe will pay a price. I, we had a long talk, he and I, when we -- I know him relatively well. And I-- the conversation started off, I said, \"I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared.\"\nI did say that to him, yes. And -- and his response was, \"We understand one another.\" It was-- I wasn't being a wise guy. I was alone with him in his office. And that -- that's how it came about. It was when President Bush had said, \"I looked in his eyes and saw his soul.\"\nI said, \"Looked in your eyes and I don't think you have a soul.\" And looked back and he said, \"We understand each other.\" Look, most important thing dealing with foreign leaders in my experience, and I've dealt with an awful lot of 'em over my career, is just know the other guy. Don't expect somethin' that you're-- that -- don't expect him to-- or her to-- voluntarily appear in the second editions of Profiles in Courage.\nUh-huh. I do.\n-- it's not free.\nThree things. One, I'm the guy that released the report. That report had been done for a while. It wasn't released. I insisted it be released, number one. Number two, when I spoke to the king, I made it clear to the king -- the king, his father, that things were gonna change. And I insisted on several things. Number one, we held accountable all the people in that organization --\nNot the crown prince because we have never, that I'm aware of, when we have an alliance with a country, gone to the acting head of state and punished that person. And -- and -- ostracized him. But here's the deal. We said, number one, end the war in Yemen. End the starvation there.\nNumber two -- and I went down the list of the things we expected the Saudis to do. And they're in the process of doing those things. And if they don't, we're gonna -- it's a changed relationship. It's a changed relationship we have with Saudi Arabia. There's no blank check.\nI'm in the process of making that decision now as to when they'll leave. The fact is that -- that was not a very solidly negotiated deal that the president, the former president -- worked out. And so we're in consultation with our allies as well as the government. And -- that decision's gonna be -- it's in process now.\nI don't think a lot longer.\nCould happen, but it -- it is tough beca-- look, one of the drawbacks, George, and it's gonna be, like, Sanskrit to people listening here, but it is the failure to have an orderly transition from the Trump presidency to my presidency, which usually takes place from Election Day to the time you're sworn in, has cost me time and consequences.\nFor example, we didn't realize how bad things were in terms of lack of vaccines. We didn't realize how -- because we were not -- we were not able to get access to this information. That's part of -- that's one of the issues we're talking about now in terms of Afghanistan.\nYes. I think he'd probably end up being prosecuted too.\nWell, that's a judgment for them to make -- whether he can be effective. Here's my position and it's been my position since I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. A woman should be presumed telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward. Number one. But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. That's what's going on now.\nThat's what I think happens. And, by the way, it may very well be there could be a criminal prosecution that is attached to it. I just don't know. But let the investiga -- and I'm not-- I don't know what it is. But I start with the presumption it takes a lotta courage for a woman to come forward. Some are not -- anyway, takes a lotta courage to come forward. So the presumption is it should be taken seriously. And it should be investigated. And that's what's under way now.\nWell, there wasn't -- all the -- George, I was thinkin' about this. I was tryin' to explain to somebody the other day. Initially, was a kid when I ran, when I was 43 years old to try to get the nomination. What I thought of was, you know, how do you compare yourself to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt?\nAnd it's intimidating. But I thought about it. I've personally known seven presidents well. And I've played in the same teams they played on. And -- there're some with great strengths, more strengths than I have, weaknesses. But what hasn't surprised me is the subject matter.\nI think I know as much about the subject matter and have as firmly held positions and capacity to understand how the system works as anybody who's been president, at least in, you know, the last 50 years. But what has surprised me is that I'm not as surprised as I thought I might be.\nI don't know if that makes any sense. But, you know, it's like sitting -- you know, when I was vice president, the big, big difference is that famous expression of Harry Truman, \"The buck stops here.\" For eight years, I had a great relationship, and still do, with Barack. And he'd ask me -- and I'd always be the last person in the room. And I'd say, you know, \"Throw the pass or run the ball.\" And I'd give my opinion. I was the last guy. And I -- I'd get to leave.\nHe's all by himself to have to make that decision. That's the big difference.\nMost of the time, yes. As a practical matter, yeah, she is. But -- she has -- we -- we have a lot -- there's a lot more ground to cover right now. So she's doin' an incredible job. But she is -- she's on the West Coast right now. She's all over the place.\nYeah -- the answer's yes. Look, Major was a rescue pup. Major did not bite someone and penetrate the skin. What happens is for-- I guess what surprised me is the White House itself, living there. Every door you turn to, there's a guy there in a black jacket.\nAnd so you're walkin' and we got -- and -- the dog's being trained now -- our trainer at home in Delaware -- and he was going home. I didn't banish him to home. Jill was gonna be away for four days. I was gonna be away for two, so we took him home.\nAnd, you know, we have a dogsitter there -- a friend who takes him. And -- but you turn a corner and there's -- there's two people I don't know at all. And, you know, and they move -- and he moves to protect. But he is -- he's a sweet dog.\n85 percent of the people there love him. He just -- all he does is lick them and wag his tail. But he does -- you know, it -- I realize some people, understandably, are afraid of dogs to begin with. And -- I just think that-- anyway, we're -- in the process of having a training session.\nI'm gonna see him tonight, yeah.\nThank you, George. I appreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2021-03-25", "Text": "Please, please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Good afternoon. Before I take questions, I want to make—give you a progress report to the Nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the American people.\nFirst, on vaccinations: On December 8, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people's arms in my first 100 days. We met that goal last week by day 58, 42 days ahead of schedule.\nNow, today I'm setting a second goal, and that is: We will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people's arms. That's right: 200 million shots in 100 days. I know it's ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close—not even close—to what we are doing. And I believe we can do it.\nAnd today, we've made a historic investment in reaching the hardest hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest risk communities—as a consequence of the virus—by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them.\nI also set a goal, before I took office, of getting a majority of schools in K through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. Now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, State education officials and leaders, a recent Department of Education Department survey shows that nearly half of the K-through-8 schools are open now full time, 5 days a week, for in-person learning. Not yet a majority, but we're really close. And I believe, in the 35 days left to go, we'll meet that goal as well.\nAs of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people's bank accounts. That's real money in people's pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon.\nOne final note: Since we passed the American Rescue Plan, we're starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. Since it was passed, a majority—a majority—of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that's going to take place this year. They're now projecting it will exceed 6 percent, a 6-percent growth in GDP.\nAnd just this morning we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. That's the first time in a year the number has fallen below the prepandemic high. So there are still too many Americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do.\nBut I can say to you, the American people: Help is here, and hope is on the way.\nNow I'll be happy to take your questions.\nZeke [Zeke Miller], the Associated Press.\nWell, I'm going to—look, when I took office, I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning—there are a lot of problems—put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems.\nAnd the other problems we're talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and—whether it's immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country.\nBut the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're not going to be—they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.\nSo we're going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. But that's the reason why I focused as I have.\nAnd here's the deal: I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. But I'm not going to do that; I'm just going to move forward and take these things as they come.\nWell, I plan on making progress on all of them, but that's going to be for the American people to decide.\nI think—you know, I doubt whether—maybe you did; maybe others did. I thought—many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan I got passed, passed, without any Republican votes. A pretty big deal. It got passed. Growing the economy. People's lives are changing.\nSo let's see what happens. All I know, I've been hired to solve problems—to solve problems, not create division.\nWell, look, I guess I should be flattered people are coming because I'm the nice guy; that's the reason why it's happening—that I'm a decent man or however it's phrased. That—you know, that's why they're coming, because, you know, Biden is a good guy.\nThe truth of the matter is: Nothing has changed. As many people came—28-percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of—in 2019, before the pandemic, in the Trump administration. It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year.\nIn addition to that, there is a—and nobody—and by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31-percent increase under Trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? That's not the reason they're coming.\nThe reason they're coming is that it's the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they're coming because of the circumstances in-country—in-country.\nThe way to deal with this problem—and I started to deal with it back when I was a United States Senator—I mean, Vice President—putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving.\nWhat did Trump do? He eliminated that funding. He didn't use it. He didn't do it. And in addition to that, what he did—he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and—and has been—continued to be a problem for a long time. He, in fact, shut down the number of beds available. He did not fund HHS to get people to get the children out of those Border Patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days, a little while. But he dismantled all of that.\nAnd so what we're doing now is attempting to rebuild—rebuild the system that can accommodate the—what is happening today. And I like to think it's because I'm a nice guy, but it's not. It's because of what's happened every year.\nLet me say one other thing on this. If you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back—are being sent back. Thousands—tens of thousands of people who are—who are over the 18 years of age and single—people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home.\nWe're sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. We're trying to work out now, with Mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. But we're—that's what's happening. They're not getting across the border.\nAnd those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we're moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as I said. For example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. We're not talking about people ripping babies from mothers' arms or little 3-year-olds standing on the border. Less than—I think it's 1½ percent fall in the category of the very young. So what we're doing is, we're providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child—no one should be in any longer than 72 hours.\nAnd today, I went to—for example, I used all the resources available to me, went to the Defense Department, and—and the Secretary of Defense has just made available Fort Bliss—5,000 beds be made easily available. Five thousand beds on the Texas border.\nSo we're building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It's going to take time.\nAnd the other thing we're doing, I might add—am I giving you too long an answer? Because if you don't want the details——\nNo, no, but I mean—I don't know how much detail you want about immigration. Maybe I'll stop there, and finish——\nIllegal Immigration/Unaccompanied Minors at the Mexico-U.S. Border\nWell, look, I'm going to deal with all of those problems. The question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate.\nLet's go to the first question you asked—the first of the second questions you asked. And that is: What about dealing with families? Why are not—some not going back? Because Mexico is refusing to take them back. They're saying they won't take them back, not all of them.\nWe're in negotiations with the President of Mexico. I think we're going to see that change. They should all be going back, all be going back. The only people we're not going to let sitting there on the other side of the Rio Grande by themselves with no help are children.\nAnd what we're doing there, and it's an important point to understand—I know you understand; I don't mean to say it that way—an important point to focus on: The vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to United States come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the United States—a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop.\nWell, what was happening before is, it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. Well, we've set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there's a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. And then, a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. They're establishing that right off the bat.\nIf it, in fact, is mom or dad, dad says—to take the extreme case—\"I've got a birth certificate.\" Then guess what? We're getting that kid directly to that parent immediately.\nAnd so that's going to reduce significantly—there's two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a Border Patrol station. One is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. The second way to do it is put them in a Health and Human Services facility that we're occupying now—both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, Federal resources like Fort Bliss—to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined.\nFilibuster. Filibuster. You know, with regard to the filibuster, I believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago. And that is that—it used to be required for the filibuster—and I had a card on this; I was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them—that it used to be that the—that from between 1917 to 1971—the filibuster existed—there were a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. Last year alone, there were five times that many. So it's being abused in a gigantic way.\nAnd, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote.\nSo I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are—are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote—like the basic right to vote. We've amended the filibuster in the past.\nBut here's the deal: As you observed, I'm a fairly practical guy. I want to get things done. I want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the American people. And in order to do that in a 50/50 Senate, we've got to get to the place where I get 50 votes so that the Vice President of the United States can break the tie, or I get 51 votes without her.\nAnd so I'm going to say something outrageous: I have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate. So the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to—anyway—I—we're going to get a lot done. And if we have to—if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about.\nOkay. Hang on. Sorry. Oh, Seung Min—Ms. Kim [Seung Min Kim, Washington Post].\n[Laughter] If we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. You're going to have to—the existing rule—it's going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster.\nBut it's not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. But our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we've got a lot we can do while we're talking about what we're going to do about the filibuster.\nLet me get here. Okay, Cecilia Vega [Cecilia Vega, ABC News].\nConditions in Central America/Unaccompanied Minors at the Mexico-U.S. Border/Addressing the Root Causes of Migration\nAstounding.\nWell, look, the idea that I'm going to say—which I would never do—\"if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\"—no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.\nThat's why I've asked the Vice President of the United States, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in the first place. It's because of earthquakes, floods. It's because of lack of food. It's because of gang violence. It's because of a whole range of things.\nThat—when I was Vice President and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, I was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like—in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is, they couldn't walk in the street because they were getting—their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence.\nWell, what I was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but I was able to say: \"Okay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? I'll put the lighting in.\" We've got a contractor. We've got the type of lighting. We paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the Government. And violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. Fewer people sought to leave.\nWhen this hurricane occurred—two hurricanes—instead of us going down and helping in a major way so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn't have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. We're going to do a lot in our administration. We're going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place.\nThat mother did not sit around with—on the kitchen table and say: \"You know, I've got a great idea: The way I'm going to make sure my son get taken care of is, I'm going to put a\"—how old was he, or she?\nA 9-year-old. \"I'm going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the United States because I know Joe Biden is a nice guy, and he'll take care of him.\"\nWhat a desperate act to have to take. The circumstances must be horrible. So we can do something about that. That's what the Vice President is going to be doing: what I did. When President Obama asked me to come and deal, I was in Turkey at the time, and he said, \"You've got to come home and take care of this.\" So we put together a plan, and it had an impact.\nAnd so, the question here is whether—how we go ahead and do this; what we do. There's no easy answer.\nWell, the judgment has to be made whether or not—and in this young man's case, he has a mom at home; there's an overwhelming reason why he'd be put in a plane and flown back to his mom.\nDetention Conditions at the Mexico-U.S. Border\nYes.\nIs—that's a serious question, right?\nIs it acceptable to me? Come on. That's why we're going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. That's why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That's why I've been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely—not just children, but particularly children—to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what's happening.\nThat is totally unacceptable.\nKen [Ken Thomas, Wall Street Journal].\nWithdrawal of U.S. Military Forces From Afghanistan\nThe answer is that it's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, it's hard to get those troops out. So what we've been doing—what I've been doing and what Secretary Blinken has been doing—has been—we've been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have—NATO allies who have troops in Afghanistan as well. And if we leave, we're going to do so in a safe and orderly way.\nWe're in consultation, I said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. And Secretary Blinken is meeting in Brussels this week with our NATO allies, particularly those who have forces there.\nAnd General Austin is—just met with Kayani [Ghani]* and I'm waiting for the briefing on that. He is the \"leader,\" quote, in Afghanistan and Kabul. And there's a U.N.-led process that's beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people—how to end this war.\nBut it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. But the question is: How and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by President Trump to leave under a deal that looks like it's not being able to be worked out to begin with? How is that done? But we are not staying a long time.\nWe will leave. The question is when we leave.\nI can't picture that being the case.\nOkay, Kristen [Kristen Welker, NBC News].\nDetention Conditions at the Mexico-U.S. Border/News Media Accessibility\nI will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well.\nI will commit to transparency and as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now.\nAnd one of the reasons I haven't gone down—I have all my—my chief folks have gone down—is I don't want to become the issue. I don't want to be, you know, bringing all of the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So this is being set up, and you'll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.\nI don't know, to be clear.\nTo roll back what? I'm sorry.\nFirst of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all—did not slow up the amount of immigration—and there's many people coming.\nAnd rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of \"Remain in Mexico,\" sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and—I make no apologies for that.\nI make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became President that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so I make no apologies for that.\nLet me say that, number one, U.N. Resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested—number one. We're consulting with our allies and partners. And there will be responses—if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly.\nBut I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. So that's what we're doing right now: consulting with our allies.\nYou've only got another hour now, okay? [Laughter]\nYes.\nWhat I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some States that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you're going to end voting at 5 o'clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances.\nIt's all designed—and I'm going to spend my time doing three things: One, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the House, number one. Number two, educating the American public. The Republican voters I know find this despicable. Republican voters, the folks out in the—outside this White House. I'm not talking about the elected officials; I'm talking about voters. Voters.\nAnd so I am convinced that we'll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic what they're trying to do, and it cannot be sustained. I'm going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the House and the Senate, to keep that from becoming the law.\nThe answer is \"yes,\" but I'm not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.\n[Laughter] My predecessor needed to. [Laughter] My predecessor. Oh God, I miss him. [Laughter]\nNo, the answer is \"yes.\" My plan is to run for reelection. That's my expectation.\nBipartisanship/Senate Minority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell\nNo, I haven't at all. I've been meeting—when is the last time a President invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? Everything from how we work—we're working with a group of 20 Members of the Senate right now and House on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. And we're working together on a bunch of things.\nBut look, I know Mitch well; Mitch knows me well. I would expect Mitch to say exactly what he said. But this is a matter of making sure that—I would like Republican—elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I'm doing.\nAnd so, unless Mitch says the last thing I did is—the last piece of legislation is so far left—well, then he ought to a look at his party. Over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what I did.\nThat counts as a question, but go ahead.\nNo, no—you can.\nYes.\nSuccessful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let's figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It's been abused from the time it came into being—by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let's deal with the abuse first.\nI answered your question.\nI said, \"That is my expectation.\"\nLook, I don't know where you guys come from, man. I've never been able to travel. I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan 4½, 3½ years ahead for certain.\nI would fully expect that to be the case. She's doing a great job. She's a great partner. She's a great partner.\nOh, come on. I don't even think about—I don't—I have no idea. I have no idea if there will be a Republican Party. Do you? I know you don't have to answer my question, but I mean, you know, do you?\nI mean, look, this is—the way I view things—I've become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that's in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working, decent American people who are getting—really having it stuck to them.\nI want to change the paradigm. I want to change the paradigm. We start to reward work, not just wealth. I want to change the paradigm.\nIf you notice—don't you find it kind of interesting that my Republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had—if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it—in dealing with the—the act that we just passed which puts money in people's pockets—ordinary people.\nDid you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion Trump tax cut, 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? Did you hear them talk about that all? I love the fact that they've found this whole idea of concern about the Federal budget. It's kind of amazing.\nWhen the Federal budget is saving people's lives, they don't think it's such a good idea. When the Federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest Americans—90 of the Fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making—you know, if you're a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you're paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is—something is wrong. Their newfound concern.\nI'm concerned—look, I meant what I said when I ran. And a lot of you still think I'm wrong, and I respect that. I said: \"I'm running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the American political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country—the middle class, hard-working people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. They built America, and unions built them.\" The third reason I said I was running was to unite the country. And, generically speaking, all of you said, \"No, you can't do that.\" Well, I've not been able to unite the Congress, but I've been uniting the country, based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to.\nSo, from my perspective, you know, it's a—to me, it's about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people—just hard-working people. People get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have—make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether they—since he didn't have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. These are basic things. Basic things.\nAnd I'm of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered Republicans, by and large, share that same view, that same sense of what is—you know, what's appropriate.\nWell, look, they're each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about.\nI've known Xi Jinping for a long time. Allegedly, by the time I left office as Vice President, I had spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader had, because President Obama and the Chinese President Hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the President of the United States to spend time with the Vice President of another country. But it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of China.\nSo I spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter—my interpreter and his—going into great detail. He is very, very straightforward. Doesn't have a democratic—with a small \"D\"—bone in his body. But he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys, like Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can't function in an ever—an ever-complex world.\nSo, when I was elected and he called to congratulate me, I think to the surprise of the China experts who were—his people were on the call as well as mine, listening—we had a 2-hour conversation. For 2 hours. And we made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again what I've told him in person on several occasions: that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition.\nTwo, that we'll have strong competition, but we'll insist that China play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade.\nThirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're going to need three things to do that. I tell him, our people. First, we're going to invest in American workers and American science. I said that all through the campaign and I say it again. And we're—and I'm setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the sixties, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire GDP in pure research and investment in science. Today, it's 0.7 percent. I'm going to change that. We're going to change that.\nThe future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. And so what I'm going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent.\nOne of the reasons why I've set up the—the PAB [PCAST]*—the President's board with scientists and the like, again—is we're going to invest in medical research—cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, the things—industries of the future—artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. And we're going to make real investments. China is outinvesting us by a long shot, because their plan is to own that future.\nThe third—the second thing we're going to do is, we're going to reestablish our alliances. And I've been very clear with him, it's not anti-Chinese. And we've talked about it.\nI want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this—as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we've been going close to an hour. I'm happy to go longer. But one of the things that I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in Europe and very shortly—I think within the next hour or so. I don't know the exact time.\nAnd earlier this month—and apparently, it got the Chinese's attention; that's not why I did it—I met with our allies and how we're going to hold China accountable in the region: Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—the so-called Quad. Because we have to have democracies working together.\nBefore too long, I'm going to have—I'm going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so we're going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules—to follow the rules—whether it relates to the South China Sea or the North China Sea or their agreement made on Taiwan or a whole range of other things.\nAnd the third thing, and the thing that I admire about dealing with with Xi is, he understands—he makes no pretense about not understanding what I'm saying any more than I do him—I pointed out to him: No leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. And I said as—\"And, Mr. President, as I've told you before, Americans value the notion of freedom. America values human rights. We don't always live up to our expectations, but it's a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we're going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear—make it clear—what's happening.\"\nAnd he understood that. I made it clear that no American President—at least one did—but no American President ever back down from speaking out of what's happening to the Uyghurs, what's happening in Hong Kong, what's happening in-country. That's who we are. The moment a President walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. It's who we are.\nSo I see stiff competition with China. China has an overall goal, and I don't criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch, because the United States are going to continue to grow and expand.\nNo, that's not where I make the decision; that's where I make sure we're all on the same page. All on the same page. Look, I predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? Because that is what is at stake, not just with China.\nLook around the world. We're in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? How will they do that? And are democracies equipped—because all the people get to speak—to compete?\nIt is clear, absolutely clear—and most of the scholars I dealt with at Penn agree with me around the country—that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.\nIf you notice, you don't have Russia talking about communism anymore. It's about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country—that's what's at stake here. We've got to prove democracy works.\nAll the above. It's a matter of timing.\nAs you've all observed, successful Presidents—better than me—have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they're doing—order it, decide on priorities, what needs to be done.\nThe next major initiative is—and I'll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh, in detail—is to rebuild the infrastructure—both physical and technological infrastructure in this country—so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. Really good-paying jobs.\nAnd some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great Republican goal and initiative. I still think the majority of the American people don't like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. I mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide.\nSome of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your Governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what's the first thing that business asked? \"What's the closest access to an interstate highway? How far am I from a freight rail? Is the water available? Is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?\" All the things that relate to infrastructure.\nWe have somewhere—I asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did—not for this, but for a longer discussion. We have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure—we have—we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. China is investing three times more in infrastructure than the United States is.\nWell, they're already getting better, but they're going to get real—they'll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we're going to hear of some people leaving, okay?\nWe can get this done. We're going to get it done.\nI had a long meeting with the entire team and several Cabinet-level officers the other night. We're going to be moving, within the next—within the next week, over 100,000—I mean, 1,000 people out of the Border Patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. We're going to significantly ramp up. We're already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at HHS—and there's a lot of them doing other things—and move them into making those calls. We're in a—we're in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done.\nBut I admire the fact that you were down there; you're making the calls yourself. It's real.\nThe next thing that has to happen though—as you well know has to happen—there have to be some certitude that this is the—actually mom, dad, or whomever. And there's ways to do that. There's ways to do that—a little bit like determining whether or not you've got the right code for your credit card, you know? \"What was your dog's name?\" kind of a thing. I'm being a bit facetious, but not really. And also seeking harder data, from DNA to birth certificates, which takes longer.\nSo I want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible.\nWell, I can't guarantee that. But I know, you know, that old thing: The journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step.\nYou know as well as I do; you cover it: You have serious—it's not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in Guatemala—I mean, in somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe, saying: \"I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have. Give it to a coyote. Have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don't speak the language. Won't that be fun? Let's go.\" That's not how it happens. People don't want to leave.\nWhen my great-grandfather got on a coffin ship in the Irish Sea, expectation was: Was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the United States of America? But they left because of what the Brits had been doing. They were in real, real trouble. They didn't want to leave. But they had no choice. So you've got—we can't—I can't guarantee we're going to solve everything, but I can guarantee we can make everything better. We can make it better. We can change the lives of so many people.\nAnd the other thing I want to point out to you and I hope you point out: I realize it's much more heart wrenching—and it is—to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old. But you went down there, and you saw: The vast majority of these children—70 percent—are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. Doesn't make it—that doesn't make it good, bad, or indifferent. But the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these God-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night—and there's some; that's true. That's why we've got to act.\nAnd yesterday I asked my team—both the Director of the two agencies, as well as others—I asked them what would they, in fact—and I asked their opinion because they're the experts—but I said, \"Focus on the most vulnerable immediately.\"\nBut there's no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can't be made in the first 48 hours and begin.\nNo, because I know they have to posture for a while. They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a—but I'm ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better.\nBut, folks, I'm going. Thank you very, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1268"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan", "Date": "2021-04-16", "Text": "Well, good afternoon. The Prime Minister has brought the sun out, so he can do about anything.\nNow we will each take a few questions, and I'll begin by recognizing the Associated Press. Aamer [Aamer Madhani, Associated Press], you have the first question. There you are.\nI've never not prioritized this. No one has worked harder to deal with the violence used by individuals using weapons than I have. I'm the only one ever to have passed an assault weapons ban. I'm the only one that ever got a 10-year ban on assault weapons and clips of more than 10 bullets.\nImmediately upon us becoming in office, having an Attorney General, I asked him to put together the things I could do by Executive order, including dealing with new guns that can be made—you can buy in pieces and put together, and other initiatives.\nI strongly support—I strongly support—the universal background checks, which I continue to push. The Congress has to step up and act. The Senate has to act. And I strongly support and continue—I've never stopped supporting the ban on assault weapons and magazines that hold more than 10 bullets.\nIt doesn't mean that I can't also be working at the same time on the economy and on COVID. But it's not a question of my being able to set the agenda in the Senate as to what they will move to first. And so I continue and I strongly, strongly urge my Republican friends in the Congress who even refused to bring up the House-passed bill to bring it up now.\nThis has to end. It's a national embarrassment. It is a national embarrassment what's going on. And it's not only these mass shootings that are occurring. Every single day—every single day, there's a mass shooting in this United—in the United States if you count all those who are killed out on the streets of our cities and our rural areas. It's a national embarrassment and must come to an end.\nAnd one last thing: The folks who own weapons, the folks who own guns, they support universal background checks. The majority of them think we should not be selling assault weapons. Who, in God's name, needs a weapon that can hold 100 rounds or 40 rounds or 20 rounds? It's just wrong. And I'm not going to give up until it's done.\nYou have a question you want to offer? I mean, not a question—[laughter]—recognize someone, Mr. Prime Minister.\nNext question is—goes to Trevor [Trevor Hunnicutt, Reuters] of Reuters.\nLet me respond to the Iran question. We do not support and do not think it's at all helpful that Iran is saying it's going to move to enrich to 60 percent. It is contrary to the agreement. We are, though, nonetheless pleased that Iran has continued to agree to engage in discussions—in direct discussions with us and with our partners on how we move forward and what is needed to allow us to move back into the JOPCA [JCPOA]* so that we are a part of it again—that we should have never gotten out of, in my view—without us making concessions that I'm—we're just not willing to make.\nAnd so the discussions are underway. I think it's premature to make a judgement as to what the outcome will be, but we're still talking.\nWell, thank you all very much. And thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I look forward to having you back.\nThank you again, everyone.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-yoshihide-suga-japan"}
{"Title": "Interview with Craig Melvin of NBC's \"Today\"", "Date": "2021-04-30", "Text": "That's the reason why it's recovering because we're investing. Look how rapidly it's recovered since we passed the last piece of legislation, and that legislation was $1.9 trillion. If we don't invest in this country, we're going to fall behind even further.\nWell, first of all, the facts don't reflect that. I don't have any inordinate faith in government, but there's certain things only the government can do. We rank number eight in the world in terms of infrastructure for God's sake. Is the private sector going to go out and build billions of dollars worth of highways, ports, airports, bridges? Are they going to do that? And so these are things that only government can really do.\nNo, I don't think the American people are racist, but I think after 400 years, African-Americans have been left in a position where they're so far behind the eight ball in terms of education, health, in terms of opportunity. I don't think America is racist, but I think the overhang from all of the Jim Crow and before that slavery have had a cost and we have to deal with it.\nI don't know. I'm going to leave that to the military.\nWell, I'm not saying I won't. I think you're going to see more and more of them getting it. I think it's going to be a tough call as to whether or not they should be required to have to get it in the military because you're in such close proximity with other military personnel, whether you're in quarters where you're all sleeping or whether you're out in maneuvers.\nBased on the science and the CDC, they should probably all be open. There's not overwhelming evidence that there's much of a transmission among these young people.\nSure, sure. I mean, but what I'm going to do though, because the likelihood of my being able to be outside and people not come up to me is not very, very high. So it's like, look, you and I took our masks off when I came in because look at the distance we are. But if we were in fact sitting there talking to one another close, I'd have my mask on and I'd make you to have a mask, even though we both been vaccinated. And so it's a small precaution to take that has a profound impact. It's a patriotic responsibility for God's sake. It's making sure that your wife, your children, if in fact they haven't been vaccinated, making sure that they're not going to get sick.\nIt is getting urgent action. Now, for example, a month ago, we had thousands of young kids in custody in places they shouldn't be, controlled by the border patrol. We have now cut that down dramatically. Hey, look, here's what happened, Craig. The failure to have a real transition, the two departments that didn't give us access to virtually anything were the Immigration and the Defense Department. So we didn't find out they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably.\nWell, look, it's way down now. We've now gotten control. For example, they didn't plan for which it comes every year, this flow, whether it's 26,000 or 10,000, they didn't have the beds that were available. They didn't plan for the overflow. They didn't plan for the Department of Health and Human Services to have places to take the kid from the border patrol and put them in beds where there were security and there were people that could take care of them. So there's a significant change right now, significant change in the circumstance for children coming to and at the border.\nI don't think that's true, but that could be. What we have done is we have united children with their families as they've come across the border, but one of the things is we don't know yet where those kids are. We're trying like hell to figure out what happened. It's almost like being a sleuth and we're still continuing to try like hell to find out where they are.\nAbsolutely. And look, here's the deal.\nDo not send your kids, period. There are most they're in jeopardy going and making that thousand mile trek. And so what we're doing now is we're going back to those countries in question where most of its coming from and saying, look, you can apply from your country. You don't have to make this trek.\nI gave him my word, I was not. I made a pledge. I would not interfere in any way, order or try to stop any investigation the Justice Department had in way. I learned about that last night when the rest of the world learned about it.\nNo, and I'm not asking to be briefed. I'm not asking to brief. That's the Justice Department's independent judgment. This last administration politicized the Justice Department so badly, so many of them quit. The Justice Department is the people's lawyer. Not the President's lawyer.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-craig-melvin-nbcs-today"}
{"Title": "Interview with Lawrence O'Donnell of MSNBC", "Date": "2021-05-12", "Text": "Yes, but there are close seconds that we're going to have – that are going to be announced in a couple of days. We have another 50 million that have been put in arms, so it will be 250 million.\nAnd one of the things I focused on when I got elected, I said I had two overwhelming needs; one, to get the American public vaccinated, and we had to go out and get an awful lot of vaccinators as well as vaccine to get 600 million doses of it, and we got that, a lot of it, done.\nAnd to get people back to work, because, you know, we lost millions of jobs — 22 million, I think it was 22 million jobs. And they're directly related to the vaccine — not to — to COVID-19.\nSo, what I'm continuing to do is making sure we get people back to work and change the circumstance where we get to the far point, where we have at least 70 percent of the American public vaccinated, and my goal is by July the 4. And I think we can do that. We're close to 59 percent getting one shot, so I think we're getting very close.\nO'Donnell.You're coming up against something we've never seen before in any vaccination program or any public health program, which is a partisan resistance to vaccination.\nThis is in addition to other hesitancies that other populations have. But there is a partisan resistance, and that is among people, many of whom fail what is a basic mental competency test -- who is the president of the United States? They actually get that question wrong.\nHow are you going to convince them to get the vaccine?\nThey're showing up. All this stuff about vaccine hesitancy; the truth of the matter is more and more and more people are getting the vaccine.\nAnd so, I've never believed that there would be a large percentage of Americans who wouldn't get the vaccine.\nBut what's the best way — you know, you used to do local politics a hundred years ago — what happens? When your neighbor gets a vaccine, your next-door-neighbor gets it, you say, well, maybe I should get it. And no matter what your position was, when you see people in a position where you can easily get the vaccine, you don't have to go way out of your way.\nThat's why you see I was on doing some meetings with folks who are providing for example and the governor of Maine, a Republican, is saying, if you want to get a free hunting license, come get a vaccine. Well, people are showing up.\nAnd people are showing up across the board. So, the idea, I've never believed that at the end of the day, there would be any large percentage of Americans who would not get the vaccine.\nO'Donnell.I have a question from my Telemundo colleague, Vanessa Hauc, who wonders, what do you say to people who worry that their immigration status is a reason not to get the vaccine?\nWell, I say they shouldn't worry. They should get the vaccine. They should get the vaccine.\nO'Donnell.And there won't be any interactions with government that occur because they get the vaccine?\nWhat I have said is that it's one thing for people who are in country here to have, if they show up for a doctor's appointment, they show up to drop their child off at school, et cetera, we should lay off those people.\nWe should, and that's why I introduced a comprehensive immigration bill. There's 11 million undocumented people in the United States, the vast majority of whom overstayed their visas.\nWe should move about getting that taken care of, making sure there's a pathway to earn citizenship and get underway. They should not be in a position that, if they're trying to save their lives or their health and they do what's needed to be done to make people around them safe as well, they shouldn't be penalized for that.\nO'Donnell.You just had a meeting with the Big Four; the speaker of the House, minority leader of the House, majority leader of the Senate, minority leader of the Senate, and it had that external signal, which is always a good sign, which is that it went into overtime, it went much longer than people outside the room were expecting.\nKevin McCarthy said it was a productive meeting. Mitch McConnell said it was a productive meeting. But they do seem to be drawing a red line, as Mitch McConnell called it, on any taxes, any taxes to pay for an infrastructure bill, and you have some serious tax increases in your infrastructure bill.\nWell, look, there was a red line saying they wouldn't do anything on anything, quite frankly.\nO'Donnell.Well, that was last week. Mitch McConnell said last week —\nYeah.\nO'Donnell.— he had 100 percent of Republican senators lined up against your infrastructure bill.\nI understand that. That's — but I think we can have a deal.\nAnd there are ways in which we can pay for this without just putting the entire burden on working class and middle-class people.\nFor example, there's a situation where there's an estimation of somewhere between $700 billion and a one-trillion-three-hundred billion dollars, if we hire up more IRS agents and we go after those folks who are avoiding taxes at the top end.\nAnd that is — I mean, these are serious — this isn't pie in the sky — these are serious, serious experts and liberals, conservatives, et cetera.\nSo, let's say it's somewhere in between; that's one trillion dollars. I'm confident they would go for that.\nI'm confident, for example, something that's not in the, that two-trillion-dollar tax cut for which nothing was paid for, and it ended up being — increasing the debt. There's a thing called stepped up basis. That's not in it. Stepped up basis is complicated. I didn't know what it was; I never had any money, so I didn't know what it was.\nBut for example, if you have a capital gain, you're a wealthy person, you're about to cash-in, you bought a million-dollars' worth of stock, now it's worth it's worth one-million-five-hundred-thousand, you're going to cash it in, and god forbid, on the way to cash it in, you figure being hit by a truck and you die, that gets left to your son or daughter; they pay none of the capital gains you would have had to pay.\nIt's not an inheritance tax. It's a tax owed 10 seconds before it happened. Eliminate that. That raises billions and billions of dollars. So, there's ways to do this.\nO'Donnell.Mitch McConnell said that he's not willing to reopen anything that was in the Trump tax cut.\nO'Donnell.Now there are —\nO'Donnell.Yes, OK. So, is that where you're exploring? Did you have an exploration of possible revenue with them, actual pay-fors —\nNo. I didn't get into that. I got into what constitutes infrastructure.\nI want to make it clear. I want to get a bipartisan deal on as much as we can get a bipartisan deal on. And that means roads, bridges, broadband, all infrastructure.\nBut I'm not giving up on the fact that we have, you know, two million women who are not able to go back to work because all the daycare centers are closed. They're out of business. And so, they can't go back to work.\nI'm not going to give up on a whole range of things that go to the question of productivity, of increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing revenues. I'm not willing to give up on that. So we're going to fight those out.\nSo I want to know, what can we agree on? And let's see if we can get an agreement to kickstart this. And then fight over what's left and see if I can get it done without Republicans, if need be.\nO'Donnell.You were trying to make a deal today in a room with Kevin McCarthy, where what he was doing before he came up here was expelling Liz Cheney from his leadership group for saying things like, the election is over, as she said last night on the House floor. And Kevin McCarthy is the same person who supported Liz Cheney just weeks ago.\nHow can you accept whatever someone like Kevin McCarthy says today as something that you're actually going to legislate a few weeks from now or months from now?\nIf a man looks me in the eye, gives me his word that something's going to happen, I take it unless he breaks it. He may have broken his word to somebody else, but to me, has he made that deal — we're nowhere near having made a deal. We agree that we should try to get a bipartisan agreement.\nBut the Liz Cheney/McCarthy thing is above my pay grade. I mean, I have enough trouble figuring out my own party all the time, let alone the Republicans.\nO'Donnell.Are you shocked that there's just, at this point, one member on the Republican side of the House who was willing to stand up last night and say things like, the election is over, and if you don't believe in the outcomes in our courts, you are an anti-constitutionalist on the Republican side. That's what her fight is on the Republican side of the House of Representatives.\nI think I heard Kevin McCarthy say today Biden's a duly elected president.\nO'Donnell.He did.\nThis is the experience I had working with you in the Senate. I have to let the audience in on this. We've known each other 25 years, and when we were working together in the Senate, what I always saw is you take the most positive things someone says in your direction and try to work with that tomorrow. And you try to ignore anything that isn't part of what you're trying to work with tomorrow.\nIs that the way you're doing this job?\nAs Pat Moynihan once said to me, Joe, I'm not sure you're Irish. You don't hold a grudge. [laughter]\nO'Donnell.Exactly. That's right.\nI don't. Look, it's too important to the American people. I don't want to sound – I'll just say what I believe. It's too important to the American people for me not to continue to reach out to get things done with people that I agree and disagree with.\nI mean, I ended up making a deal with Jesse Helms for the lord's sake on funding the United Nations. I didn't have to give up anything, but I worked on it and worked on it. He finally came around.\nBut if I had said, because Jesse Helms has done all these other things, I'm never going to deal with him — it's just not the way it works.\nI don't — look, I believe — how can I say it? My mother used to give me — I believe in redemption for myself as well.\nBut look, Lawrence, I have — I once had a doctor who was — had worked on me because I had had an aneurism 20 some years ago. He said, you know what your problem is? He said you're a congenital optimist.\nWell, I am, because I know the American people. The American people are optimistic. The American people never ever, ever, ever, ever give up. Never. Not once in our history did they give up. And I just – I have faith. I have faith, and we just got to keep pushing it.\nO'Donnell.Let me ask you about the second most powerful Joe in Washington — Joe Manchin, who has become a visitor to this White House, and he's not there with the Democrats even on everything that's proposed. He's not there 100 percent on your infrastructure bill. He's trying to work with Republicans to bring Republicans along into something that could be a compromise.\nWhat about S.1., the voting rights, voting access bill that the Senate Rules Committee considered yesterday? So important that the majority leader and minority leader went to the Rules Committee and — to testify about and talk about that bill.\nThat bill looks like there will be zero Republican votes in the Senate for that bill. That bill also doesn't fit any reconciliation rule. That bill cannot get through without 60 votes or without an adjustment to the cloture rule, which Joe Manchin would have to agree to.\nDoes Joe Manchin see this road in front of him and what that means for voting rights in America?\nI don't know. I've not had — I've not had that discussion with Joe. I've been meeting with a lot of Republicans, a lot of, quote, \"bipartisan groups\" have been coming to see me on everything from my – the overall bill, the families bill that I have and the caregivers bill, as well as the infrastructure bill.\nWe were at the same place. I don't know — I can't say that you asked me, but other serious folks in your business asked me the same kind of questions when we were trying to do the American Rescue Plan. How can you possibly get it passed? Well, it passed by one vote, even though up to the time that vote took place there were a number of people saying, I'm not going to do it.\nBut look, Lawrence, I have — this is going to sound naive. I have faith in the American people. The American people overwhelmingly support what I'm doing. The polling numbers are overwhelming — Democrat, Republican, and Independent, the averages. We've got 78 percent of the American people, if I'm not mistaken in the last major poll done, showing that they support my — what I'm talking about, this gigantic effort to try to build back and build back better.\nYou had an enormous number of American people supporting the last bill that passed. And look what's happened — 1.5 million new jobs, 1.5 million new jobs. You had all that money in there for COVID. We've now got — we have 250 million people will have gotten shots. The death rate is the lowest it's ever been. It's down 80 percent. Hospitalizations are down.\nAnd so, I just think with all I — what I have to do is just keep moving forward. Just keep moving forward, and the more we move, the more I demonstrate what we've done is working and is right, the more likelihood I'll have to get it — look, for example, you know, we used to be, back in the old days, when I first got to the Senate, we used to invest in research and development, the things of the future. We invested more money than any — a higher percentage of our GDP than any nation in the world.\nAnd China was number I think nine or something. We're now number eight. China's number one. What do we think is going to happen if we stand still for god's sake? What do we think is going to happen if more corporate American doesn't invest in research and development instead of buying back their own stock?\nWhat do — I mean, so, I think this is a matter — this is a bit of — as my grandfather, Finnegan, might say, this is a bit of an epiphany that's going on here where people are beginning to look and say, whoa, whoa.\nAnd I've met with either on the — almost all on a telephone and/or on Skype, with I think now 40-some world leaders. They want to know, is America really back? Are we really back in the game? Are we going to engage?\nAnd so, I just think — I know this sounds — well, I don't know what it sounds like, but you know, it's never ever, ever been a good bet against America. That's never occurred. It's never been a good bet, to bet against the American people, and I'm betting they're going to come around.\nO'Donnell.I just have one more question for you, and that is, you're 113 days into the presidency. This is the top of the mountain. You were climbing this career mountain for many, many years. You're the most prepared president in history with 36 years in the Senate, eight years as vice president.\nThe one thing you don't have on this 113th day in the presidency is your son, Beau's, advice, and I'm just wondering what you would say if Beau called you today and said, hey, Pop, how's it going?\nI'd say, Beau, I remember what you'd say to me every single time we'd talk about a political issue. He'd say, Dad, look at me. I'd give him my word. Dad, look at me. Remember, home base. Home base. Be who you are.\nThe one thing that I'd hope that he would say is, Dad, you're home base, you're sticking to it. Some things are worth losing over, old buddy. I haven't done this, this long than I had now to do things that I don't — I don't believe.\nO'Donnell.Mr. President, thank you very much for your time today. We really appreciate it.\nThank you. You always catch me off guard with Beau. God love him. He should be sitting in this chair.\nAnyway, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nO'Donnell.Thank you very much, Mr. President.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lawrence-odonnell-msnbc"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Moon Jae-in of South Korea", "Date": "2021-05-21", "Text": "Hello, everyone. Please. Please be seated.\nToday I've been honored to welcome to the White House President Moon. And I got an opportunity to spend some private time with him, as well as with our delegations. This is only the second person—head of state—second head of state to visit the White House since I've been President. And it's been a real joy.\nIt's a reflection of how much we value the 70-year alliance with the Republic of Korea and how essential we know the relationship is to the United States, the future of the Indo-Pacific region, and quite frankly, to the world.\nToday has been particularly special because this afternoon, in addition to our bilateral meetings, President Moon participated in a ceremony, right in this room, that—awarding the Medal of Honor to a veteran of the Korean war, a true American hero, Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr.\nAnd I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for joining us. It was special. I don't know that there's ever been an award of the Medal of Honor with the head of state of the country where the award was won. It meant a great deal to me and to the family and to our country.\nAnd—but today has not only been an affirmation of our shared history of sacrifice that binds the Republic of Korea and North—and the North—excuse me, and the United States together; it's a commitment to expanding cooperation and shaping our shared future in accordance with our democratic values that have made our nations strong and agile and highly competitive in the 21st-century economies. The Republic of Korea and the United States are both nations built on innovation, and we must both meet the challenges facing us today and look to what is possible for tomorrow.\nOur partnership is grounded on our ironclad commitment to shared security. Our alliance has long been the linchpin of peace, security, prosperity, and the region growing more prominent and us being together.\nI was grateful that our two nations were able to quickly conclude a new cost-sharing agreement for forces in Korea in March, which will benefit both our peoples. And I thank, again, the President for that agreement.\nToday we made important progress on a range of issues. We spoke about the shared approach of the Democratic—shared approach to the Democratic People's Republic in Korea and continuing threat of the D.P.R.K.'s nuclear and missile programs. My team consulted closely with President Moon's team throughout the process of our D.P.R.K. review, and we both are deeply concerned about the situation.\nOur two nations also share a willingness to engage diplomatically with the D.P.R.K. to take pragmatic steps that will reduce tensions as we move toward our ultimate goal of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nToday I affirmed to President Moon that the United States will proceed in close consultation with the Republic of Korea and our strategy and our approach. And to help drive all these efforts, I'm pleased to announce that Ambassador Sung Kim, a career diplomat and with deep policy expertise, will serve as a U.S. Special Envoy for the D.P.R.K. Ambassador Kim—you're here somewhere today—stand up, will you? Thank you for being willing to do this. Thank you for taking on this important role. We appreciate it very much.\nThank you. Well, first question, I'm told, is MaryAlice Parker [Parks]* of ABC.\nIsrael-U.S. Relations/Middle East Peace Process/Intercommunal Violence in Israel/Reconstruction Efforts in Gaza/U.S. Assistance to Palestinian Authority\nThere is no shift in my commitment and the commitment to the security of Israel, period. No shift. Not at all.\nBut I'll tell you what there is a shift in: The shift is that we have to—we still need a two-state solution. It is the only answer. The only answer.\nAnd what I am convinced of, is that we can now move—as I had—did even before, when I was able to negotiate—well, I shouldn't—before the cease-fire was negotiated, that I made it clear that—and I spoke with President Abbas—we were—we're going to make sure that we are going to provide for security in the West Bank. And we renewed the security commitment as well as economic commitment to the people on the West Bank.\nI also indicated to the Israelis that I thought it was very important that they stop, in Jerusalem, this innercommunal fighting that has extremes on both sides. It has to end. It has to end.\nAnd I'm prepared to put together—and I'm going to attempt to put together a major package, with other nations who share our view, to rebuild the homes and—without reengaging—without providing Hamas the opportunity to rebuild their weapon systems—rebuild the Gaza—rebuild Gaza. And they need the help, and I'm committed to get that done.\nAnd so I don't—and I think that, you know, my party still supports Israel. Let's get something straight here: Until the region says, unequivocally, they acknowledge the right of Israel to exist as an independent Jewish state, there will be no peace.\nGood luck. [Laughter]\nYou can ask—answer—[inaudible].\nI agree with what the President just said. Our goal is and remains complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We want to make practical progress and increase security in the United States—for the United States and our allies.\nYou know, we closely studied what others have tried, and—what worked and what hasn't worked. And you know, under—we're under no illusions how difficult this is, none whatsoever. And the past four administrations have not achieved the objective. It's an incredibly difficult objective.\nAs we move forward, we're going to stay in very close coordination with our friends and our partners in the region, including President Moon. And we fully recognize that this is about our collective security in the Indo-Pacific region. And so—but total denuclearization is our objective and remains so.\nWell, I get the next question, huh? I'd like to ask the press a question, if I may. [Laughter]\nNancy Cordes, CBS.\nWe've changed this \"one question\" thing, haven't we? [Laughter]\nOkay.\nYes.\nWell, what I never do is, I never make a judgment what a man or woman is going to do or not do based on what they said. We'll see. If he made any commitment, then I would meet with him. And if there was a commitment on which we met—and the commitment has to be that there's discussion about his nuclear arsenal, and if it's merely an—a means by which how do we deescalate what they're doing.\nAnd so, if that was the case, I would not meet unless there was some outline made that my Secretary of State and others would have negotiated as to how we would proceed.\nBut what I would not do is, I would not do what had been done in the recent past. I would not give him all that he's looking for is: national—international recognition as legitimate and say—and give them what allowed him to move in the direction of appearing to be more—how can I say it?—more serious about what he wasn't at all serious about.\nI'd have to know specifics. But the idea of never meeting with North Korea—I would make sure that my team had met with his counterparts—my—their counterparts and I know exactly what we're meeting on.\nOne of the reasons why we were able to get the cease-fire in 11 days, they didn't do what other people have done: I don't talk about what I tell people in private. I don't talk about what we negotiate in private.\nWhat I can assure you, though, is that, the last time, it took 56 days and then 6 months to get a cease-fire. I'm praying this cease-fire will hold. I take Bibi Netanyahu—when he gives me his word, I take him at his word. He's never broken his word to me.\nAnd—but what I've made clear is that it's essential—it's essential—that the Palestinians in—on the West Bank be secured, that Abbas be recognized as a leader of the Palestinian people, which he is. Hamas is a terrorist organization; we've recognized that. But that doesn't mean we should not be in Gaza, rebuilding Gaza for all those innocent people who in fact have been hurt and had been collateral damage, including loss of home and a whole range of other things—as well as insisting that Israeli citizens, whether they be Arab or Jew, are treated equally as Israeli citizens. And that's what was going on in Jerusalem.\nAnd so that has to come to an end. And Bibi know—the Prime Minister knows my views and—but the commitment that was given had—was immediately kept. I—from the very beginning, I told him what our objective was: that there needed to be a cease-fire. And he, in fact, kept his commitment in the timeframe in which he said he would do it. Thank you.\nAnd by the way, I wasn't the only one that spoke to him. We had—I look down here—every major player on my team—from the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, all the way down the line, and our National Security Adviser, were in constant contact with their counterparts in Israel, in Egypt, and throughout the Middle East.\nThis was not something that was just done with a casual conversation between myself and Bibi. I have—presumptuous of me to say this but, Mr. President—but I think I've got a great team. And the—and I spent a lot of time with Elsisi on the phone in—in Egypt. And they've done a commendable job of bringing Hamas to the table and getting them to agree to a cease-fire as well. Thank you.\nIs that it? I think there's one more question over here.\nBy the way, I can just prematurely make that. And we're going—there are 550,000 Korean soldiers, sailors, airmen who work in close contact with American forces in Korea. We'll provide full vaccinations for all 550,000 of those Korean forces engaging with American forces on a regular basis, both for their sake, as well as the sake of the American forces.\nIn addition to that, we've talked about the ability to have vaccines produced with our—working with—and this is in the offing—working with one of the major vaccine producers in the United States and to—where Korea is incredibly sophisticated. And with the help of that particular company, we'll be able to make significant numbers of vaccines for themselves.\nAnd lastly, it is my hope and expectation—I cannot commit to it because we don't know for certain—but we think that, over the remainder of 2021, we're going to be able to vaccinate every American. We have enough vaccine to vaccinate every American, period, right now. And we're going to be able to do that by the mid-summer, and we're going to continue to get more people to engage in seeking the vaccine. I don't believe—I never have believed—that there's a large percentage of Americans who will not take the vaccine. And we're doing very imaginative things, and the States are, to get people to show up and have the vaccine.\nBut we believe—we believe—that, between the second half of 2021 and going in through 2022, we can produce as many as another billion doses of vaccine. Because it's not just—and this is what I like about this President—he's not just talking about it, any more than I'm just talking about the United States or just Korea; he's talking about the Indo-Pacific. He's talking about the world.\nWe, with advanced capabilities, have an obligation to do everything we can to provide for protection of the entire world. I know that is an awfully, awfully, awfully ambitious proposal, but I think the nations that have that capacity are going to be continuing to work toward getting that done.\nAnd so thank you.\nIf you're not asking me a mean one like you usually do. [Laughter]\nI would ask him again. Thank you. [Laughter] Come on, boss, let's go.

Everyone at the table understood and understands both the seriousness and the challenges that we're up against and the responsibility of our proud democracies to step up and deliver for the rest of the world—that's what the G-7 is all about—and rallying the world's democracies to meet the challenges that the world faces and deliver for our people and for people, quite frankly, everywhere.\nEnding the pandemic and maintaining robust support for an equitable, inclusive global economic recovery were the top priorities of our nations as we got together. We know we can't achieve one without the other; that is, we have to deal with the pandemic and—in order to be able to deal with economic recovery, which—as we're doing in the States, but we committed that we're going to do more for the rest of the world as well.\nThe fact is that we—the U.S. contribution is the foundation—the foundation—to work out how we're going to deal with the hundred nations that are poor and having trouble finding vaccines and having trouble dealing with reviving their economies if they were, in the first place, in good shape.\nAnd we—I committed that we would provide a half a billion—a half a billion beyond the 80 million we've already done—half a billion doses of Pfizer vaccine, which we contracted to pay for, in addition to money we put into the COVID [COVAX]* project, which is that COVID [COVAX]* is—and I know you all know, but a lot of people may not know what COVID [COVAX]* is—that is a system whereby they're going to provide funding for states to be able to get access to vaccines on their own, as well.\nBut the bottom line is: What that generated was a commitment by the rest of our colleagues at the G-7 that they would provide another half billion. So we're going to have a billion doses of vaccine. And, in our case, the—this includes sharing more than—not just the 1 billion doses overall, but we're going to provide for 200 million of those doses by the end of the year, another 300 million by the first half of next year. And so it's—it was greeted with some enthusiasm.\nAnd we've agreed to work together so that the world is better prepared to detect and deal with future pandemics, because there will be future pandemics. We have a—I'm sure you've seen it; if you haven't, you'll get it—a joint statement we put out of the G-7. You've seen it, I'm sure. And we are committed to follow on to do some significant work, including not only how we deal with the distribution and help in getting shots in arms to the rest of the world, but how we're going to deal with putting together a mechanism to anticipate and deal with and be aware of the next—the next pandemic when it comes along. And there will be others.\nAnd we also agreed to take important steps that are going to support global economic recovery by laying the foundation for an equitable global economy. Critically, the G-7 leaders endorsed a global minimum tax of 15 percent. Too many corporations have been engaged in what are essentially tax havens, deciding that they would pay considerably less than other—in other environs around the world. And—but this is going to make sure there's a minimum tax, and I'm going to have—I'm going to move on this at home as well—a minimum tax for corporations to pay for the profits they make anywhere in the world.\nAnd this agreement is going to help arrest the race to the bottom that's been going on among nations attracting corporate investment at the expense of priorities like protecting our workers and investing in infrastructure.\nWe also made a momentous commitment at the G-7 to help meet more than $40 trillion need that exists for infrastructure in the developing world. I put forward an idea that was called—we named the \"Build Back Better World Partnership,\" which is—we're calling it the \"B3W.\" The point is that what's happening is that China has this Belt and Road Initiative, and we think that there's a much more equitable way to provide for the needs of countries around the world.\nAnd so it's been—it's a values-driven, high-standard, transparent financing mechanism we're going to provide and support projects in four key areas: climate, health, digital technology, and gender equity. And we believe that will not only be good for the countries, but it will be good for the entire world and represent values that our democracies represent and not autocratic lack of values. By harassing the full potential of those who are harassing, we're going to have to try and change things. [Laughter] That's the whole idea.\nBut here's the deal: We're going to make sure that we are able to pull together the ability to use the development financing institutions and other development tools to expect the bold, new infrastructure investment in low- and middle-income countries over the coming years, much of it coming from the private sector, which will generate the capital put in; will generate significantly more capital from the private sector.\nWe also made a historic commitment to permanently eliminate the use of our public finance to support unabated coal projects around the world and to end them by this year. The G-7 agreed to that. And those who are not members, but visiting members who are participating in the G-7, who have coal-fired facilities have also agreed that they would work in that direction as well.\nSo transitioning the world to cleaner energy sources is urgent—it's essential—if we're going to beat the climate. And there is—[laughter]—one of the things I—some of my colleagues said to me when I was there was, \"Well, the United States is—their leadership recognizes there is global warming.\" And I know that sounds silly, but you know, we had a President who last—who basically said it's not a problem, global warming. It is the existential problem facing humanity, and it's being treated that way. So we're going to provide up to $2 billion to support developing company—countries as they transition away from unabated coal-fired power.\nIn addition, we also agreed to tackle corruption, which is a threat to societies everywhere. I pointed out in a conversation I had with—with one of the leaders of—well, actually with China. And that was—it was a request for me not to try to—when I was asked what I was going to be doing after being elected, I said we're going to reestablish the strength of American relationships so we can be counted on again—alliances—and suggested that, \"Well, maybe you shouldn't get the Quad\"—meaning India, Japan, Australia, and the United States—\"working together, and maybe you shouldn't be pushing on strengthening the European Union to deal with the West not just to have\"—and so on.\nAnd I said, for an American President to—every President to be sustained, or Prime Minister, has to represent the values of their country. And I pointed out—and I mean this sincerely: We're unique as a country. We're built on—we're unique in a sense that we're not based on ethnicity or geography or religion; we're one Nation that said we organized on an idea: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men\"—and women—\"are created equal.\" It sounds corny, but it's real. And any President who doesn't act consistent with what the raison d'état for the nation is cannot be sustained that—the support of that country.\nAnd so what we were able to do is: We know that corruption undermines the trust in governments, siphons off public resources, makes economies much less competitive, and constitutes a threat to our security. So we're going to work together to address issues like the abuse of shell companies and money laundering through real estate transactions. And we've agreed that we're going to work together to address cyber threats from state and nonstate actors like criminal ransomware networks and hold countries accountable that harbor criminal ransomware actors who don't hold them accountable.\nAnd over the past few weeks, the nations of the G-7 have affirmed that democratic values that underpin everything we hope to achieve in our shared future, that we're committed to put them to work: One, delivering vaccines and ending the pandemic. Two, driving substantial, inclusive economic recovery around the world. Three, in fueling infrastructure development in places that most badly need it. And four, in fighting climate change.\nThe only way we're going to meet the global threats that we're—is by working together and with our partners and our allies. And I conveyed to each of the—my G-7 counterparts that the United States is going to do our part. America is back at the table. It's—America is back at the table.\nThe lack of participation in the past and full engagement was noticed significantly, not only by the leaders of those countries, but by the people in the G-7 countries. And America is back in the business of leading the world alongside nations who share our most deeply held values.\nAnd so the bottom line is, I was very pleased with the outcome of the entire conference. And you know, I noticed there was a lot of coverage of my—individual comments made by my colleagues about how we were all getting along together. But the truth of the matter is, we did. It wasn't—I felt it wasn't about me, but it was about America. I felt a genuine sense of enthusiasm that America was back at the table and fully, fully engaged.\nAnd now I'm going to be heading off to Brussels, to NATO. And the same—many of the same people are going to be at that table, and—in NATO—and to make the case we are back, as well. We do not view NATO as a, sort of, a protection racket. We believe that NATO is vital to our ability to maintain American security for the next—the remainder of the century. And there's a real enthusiasm.\nI made it clear—and I pointed out, and I thanked them—you know, we—article 5 is, \"An attack on one is an attack on all.\" Well, what Americans sometimes—don't forget—remember what happened on 9/11. We were attacked. Immediately, NATO supported us. NATO supported us. NATO went till we got bin Laden. NATO was part of the process. And I want them to know, unlike—whether they doubt it—that we believe NATO and section [article]* 5 is a sacred obligation. Bottom line is, I think we've made some progress in reestablishing American credibility among our closest friends and our values.\nNow, why don't I take some of your questions? And I'm told, Jonathan [Jonathan Lemire, Associated Press], I'm supposed to talk—recognize you first.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia\n[Laughter] Well, let me make it clear: I think he's right it's a low point, and it depends on how he responds to acting consistent with international norms, which, in many cases, he has not.\nAs I told him when I was running and when I got elected, before it was—I was sworn in, that I was going to find out whether or not he, in fact, did engage in trying to interfere in our election; that I was going to take a look at whether he was involved in the—a cybersecurity breach that occurred, et cetera; and if I did, I was going to respond.\nI did; I checked it out. So I had access to all the intelligence. He was engaged in those activities. I did respond and made it clear that I'd respond again.\nWith regard to—I always found—and I don't mean to suggest that the press should not know—but this is not a contest about who can do better in front of a press conference or try to embarrass each other. It's about making myself very clear what the conditions are to get a better relationship are—with Russia.\nWe're not looking for conflict. We are looking to resolve those actions which we think are inconsistent with international norms, number one. Number two, where we can work together, we may be able to do that in terms of some strategic doctrine that may be able to be worked together. We're ready to do it. And there may be other areas. There's even talk there may be the ability to work together on climate.\nSo the bottom line is that I think the best way to deal with this is for he and I to meet, he and I to have our discussion. I know you don't doubt that I'll be very straightforward—[laughter]—with him about our concerns. And I will make clear my view of how that meeting turned out, and he'll make clear how—from his perspective, how it turned out.\nBut I don't want to get into being diverted by: \"Did they shake hands? How far did they—who talked the most,\" and the rest. Now, he can say what he said the meeting was about, and I will say what I think the meeting was about.\nThat's how I'm going to handle it.\nI'm sorry, I'm going to get in trouble with staff if I don't do this the right way.\nJennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg.\nChina/Political Status of Hong Kong/Labor Practices in Xinjiang/International Assistance to Developing Countries/China-U.S. Relations\nWell, first of all, I think it—as you know, last time the G-7 met, there was no mention of China. But this time, there is mention of China. The G-7 explicitly agreed to call out human rights abuses in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong explicitly.\nTwo, to coordinate a common strategy to deal with China nonmarket policies that undermine competition. They've agreed—and that's underway now—how to do that.\nThree, to take serious actions against forced labor in solar, agriculture, and the garment industries because that's where it's happening. And they've agreed we will do that.\nTo launch—what I said earlier; I really feel very strongly—I proposed that we have a democratic alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative: the Build Back Better. And they've agreed to that, and that's underway as the details of that—we agreed that we'd put together a committee to do that and come up with that. And thirdly, that we are going to insist on a high-standards to be—for a climate-friendly, transparent alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. And—but, in the meantime, we're going to move forward.\nLook, I think it's always—let me put it this way: I know this is going sound somewhat prosaic, but I think we're in a contest, not with China per se, but a contest with autocrats, autocratic governments around the world, as to whether or not democracies can compete with them in the rapidly changing 21st century.\nAnd I think how we act and whether we pull together as democracies is going to determine whether our grandkids look back 15 years from now and say, \"Did they step up? Are democracies as relevant and as powerful as they have been?\"\nAnd I walked away from the meeting with all my colleagues believing that they are convinced that that is correct now too. Not—I shouldn't say \"now\". Not just because of me, but they believe that to be the case.\nAnd so I think you're going to see just straightforward dealing with China. And again, we're not looking—as I've told Xi Jinping myself, I'm not looking for conflict. Where we can cooperate, we'll cooperate. Where we disagree, I'm going to state it frankly, and we are going to respond to actions that are inconsistent.\nFor example, we talked about trade. It's one thing to talk about whether or not our agricultural policy makes sense. It's another thing to say: \"By the way, you're demanding that if I do business with your country, I've got to give you all my trade secrets and have the Chinese partner have 51 percent of that?\" No. Not us.\nYes.\nYes.\nI think there's plenty of action on China, and there's always something that you can—I'm sure my colleagues think there's things they think they can improve that they wanted. But I'm satisfied.\nSteve Holland, Reuters.\nI think China has to start to act more responsibly in terms of international norms on human rights and transparency.\nTransparency matters across the board. And I think the idea that—for example, one of the things I raised and others raised—I wasn't the only one who raised this at the G-7—is that we don't know—we haven't had access to the laboratories to determine whether or not—and I have not reached a conclusion because our intelligence community is not certain yet whether or not this was a consequence of a—from the marketplace of a bat, you know, interfacing with animals in the environment that caused this COVID-19 or whether it was an experiment gone awry in a laboratory.\nIt's important to know the answer to that because we have to have access—we have to build a system whereby we can know what—when we see another transparent—lack of transparency that might produce another pandemic. We have to have access. The world has to have access.\nSo we're trying to figure out, the G-7, whether we could put together an international basis upon which we could have a bottom line with what the transparency accounted for.\nTo answer that question—there's no way to answer without sounding self-serving. Let me just say this: I just laid out what I thought was the need for us to be consistent to protect our economies and to see to it that other struggling economies, who needed help, got the help and were not held captive by other nations.\nBut you might ask that to others. I'm not trying to be a wise guy, but I——\nAnd Wall Street Journal. Andrew [Andrew Restuccia, Wall Street Journal].\nYes.\nIt is—it may take slight—slightly longer than—worldwide. But the United States is going to continue—I think there's a possibility, over 2022 going into 2023, that we would be able to be in a position to provide another billion—us. But that's not done yet.\nI only—I've been very careful, as I've dealt with this pandemic, to tell you what I know and say what I thought could be done, and when I've announced that I've gone and done it. What I don't want to do is be getting too far ahead in suggesting that we can do things and I can do things—the United States can do things that I don't have done yet.\nSo I—there was a clear consensus among all our colleagues at the G-7 that this wasn't the end; we were going to stay at it until we're able to provide for—able to provide for—the needs of the whole world, in terms—because, look, it's not just the right thing to do. And from a—how can I say it?—from a moral standpoint. But it is also the correct thing to do, in terms of our own health, our own security. You can't build a wall high enough to keep out new strains. You can't do that.\nAnd so I think this is going to be a constant project for a long time. And there may be other pandemics. We—again, setting up a system whereby we can detect—before it gets out of control—one, a pandemic, that may be on the horizon—a virus—is important.\nSo we are not going to—as long as there's nations in need that—being able to be vaccinated, we in fact—not only that: We've been engaged in helping—which I've made clear, and most of our—my colleagues understood it. I mean, they understood it—knew it from trying it themselves. This is a gigantic logistical effort. It's one thing to send nation X, X number—Y number of vaccines. It's another thing to have the people that can actually get it in somebody's arm. And so we are also providing the ability for other countries to manufacture their vaccines. We've all agreed on that.\nIndia has the capacity to do that. They don't have the material capacity thus far to do the manufacturing. But there's a lot going on to provide—not only to, quote, \"give\" vaccines, but to provide the ability of the countries in question to produce their own vaccines.\nWhite House staffer.Last question. Last question.\nI'm not going to answer it. No, I'm joking. Last question.\nPeter Alexander, NBC News.\nWell, first of all, there's no guarantee you can change a person's behavior or the behavior of his country. Autocrats have enormous power, and they don't have to answer to a public. And the fact is that it may very well be, if I respond in kind—which I will—that it doesn't dissuade him; he wants to keep going.\nBut I think that we're going to be moving in a direction where Russia has its own dilemmas, let us say, dealing with its economy, dealing with its—dealing with COVID, and dealing with not only the United States, but Europe writ large and in the Middle East.\nAnd so there's a lot going on where we can work together with Russia. For example, in Libya, we should be opening up the passes to be able to go through and provide food assistance and economic—I mean, vital assistance to a population that's in real trouble.\nI think I'm going to try very much—hard to—it is—and by the way, there's places where—I shouldn't be starting off on negotiating in public here. But let me say it this way: Russia has engaged in activities which are—we believe are contrary to international norms, but they have also bitten off some real problems they're going to have trouble chewing on.\nAnd, for example, the rebuilding of Syria, of Libya, of—you know, this is—they're there. And as long as they're there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, and you can't do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people.\nSo I'm hopeful that we can find an accommodation that—where we can save the lives of people in—for example, in Libya, that—consistent with the interest of—maybe for different reasons—but reached it for the same reason—the same result.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Cyber Attacks\n[Laughter] He's Vladimir Putin.\nI'm not going to get into much more than that, because I've got to sit down with him. And I'll be happy to talk to you after that. But——\nI—yes, I'm open to—if there's crimes committed against Russia that, in fact, are—and the people committing those crimes are being harbored in the United States—I'm committed to holding them accountable. And I'm—I heard that; I was told, as I was flying here, that he said that. I think that's potentially a good sign and progress.\nThank you all very, very much. Thank you.\n[Laughter] I'm going to get in trouble with my staff. Yes, go ahead. But pretend that I didn't answer you.\nYes.\nA hundred and twenty days. Give me a break. [Laughter] Need time. Thanks.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-st-mawgan-united-kingdom"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Brussels, Belgium", "Date": "2021-06-14", "Text": "Good evening. Before I turn to today's meetings, I want to say a short word about our ongoing fight against COVID-19 at home.\nWe've made enormous progress in the United States. Much of the country is returning to normal, and our economic growth is leading the world, and the number of cases and deaths are dropping dramatically. But there's still too many lives being lost.\nWe're still averaging, the last 7 days, the loss of 370 deaths per day—370 deaths. That's significantly lower than at the peak of this crisis, but it's still a real tragedy. We're approaching a sad milestone: almost 600,000 lost lives because of COVID-19 in America. My heart goes out to all those who have lost a loved one. I know that black hole that seems to consume you, that fills up your chest when you lose someone that's close to you that you adored.\nThat's why I continue to say to America: If you've not been vaccinated, get vaccinated. Get vaccinated as soon as possible. We have plenty of vaccination, plenty of sites. We have more work to do to beat this virus, and now is not the time to let our guard down. So please, please get vaccinated as soon as possible. We've had enough pain. Enough pain.\nFolks, I know it's after 9:30, Brussels time—9:30 p.m.—and I'm still at NATO. You're all excited about that. I know. [Laughter] But I've had a chance to meet with several leaders recently, and I've had calls with others. It's been an incredibly productive day here.\nI just finished a meeting with President Erdogan of Turkey. We had a positive and productive meeting, much of it one-on-one. We had detailed discussions on how to proceed on a number of issues. Our two countries have big agendas. Our teams are going to continue our discussions, and I'm confident we'll make real progress with Turkey and the United States.\nBut now I want to thank Secretary General Stoltenberg for leading a very successful NATO summit today. I had the honor of leading off the discussion today among the 30 nations, and I pointed out that we're facing a once-in-a-century global health crisis. At the same time, the democratic values that undergird our alliance are under increasing pressure both internally and externally. Russia and China are both seeking to drive a wedge in our transatlantic solidarity. We're seeing an increase in malicious cyber activity.\nBut that our alliance is the strong foundation on which we can—our collective security and our shared prosperity can continue to be built. And I made a point to make clear that the U.S. commitment to article 5 of the NATO treaty is rock solid and unshakable. It's a sacred commitment. NATO stands together. That's how we've met every other threat in the past. It's our greatest strength as we meet our challenges of the future, and there are many.\nAnd everyone—everyone in that room today—understood the shared appreciation, quite frankly, that America is back. We talked about Russia's aggressive acts that pose a threat to NATO and to our collective security. That's why I met with the Bucharest 9—the eastern flank allies—in advance of this summit. And today I also met with the leaders of the three Baltic States: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.\nI shared with our allies that I will convey to President—what I'll convey to President Putin: that I'm not looking for conflict with Russia, but that we will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities and that we will not fail to defend the transatlantic alliance or stand up for democratic values.\nAs allies, we also affirmed our continued support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We agreed to keep consulting closely on nuclear deterrence, arms control, and strategic stability. And there was a strong consensus among the leaders in that meeting on Afghanistan. Our troops are coming home, but we agreed that our diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian commitment to the Afghan people and our support for the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces will endure.\nAnd I welcomed our allies and partners to recognize that counterterrorism efforts must continue to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for attacks on our countries, even as we take on terrorist networks in the Middle East and Africa.\nAnd I'm deeply gratified that, as an alliance, we adopted a far-reaching plan to make sure that NATO can meet the challenges that we face today and in the future, not yesterday—the NATO 2030 agenda—and that we agreed to fully resource that agenda. The last time NATO put together a strategic plan was back in 2010, when Russia was considered a partner and China wasn't even mentioned.\nWe talked about the long-term systemic challenges that China's activities pose to our collective security today. We agreed to do more to enhance the resilience of our critical infrastructure around the world, including trusted telecommunications providers, supply chains, and energy networks. We agreed to enhance our cooperation with our democratic partners in the Indo-Pacific to meet challenges that exist there.\nWe also endorsed a new cyber defense policy—NATO's first in the past 7 years—to improve the collective ability to defend against counter threats from state and nonstate actors against our networks and our critical infrastructure.\nAnd we adopted a Climate Security Action Plan—which, several years ago, people thought we would never would do—for reducing emissions from NATO installations and adapting to the security risk of climate change while keeping a sharp—very sharp on our ability to deter and defend against threats.\nAnd finally, we agreed that among the most important shared missions is renewing and strengthening the resilience of our democracies by pointing out we have to prove to the world and to our own people that democracy can still prevail against the challenges of our time and deliver for the needs of our people.\nWe have to root out corruption that siphons off our strength; guard against those who would stoke hatred and division for political gain—this phony populism; invest in strengthening the institutions that underpin and safeguard our cherished democratic values, as well as protecting the free press and independent judiciaries. All of those are on the agenda.\nThat's how I'll prove that democracy and that our alliance can still prevail against the challenges of our time and deliver for the needs and the needs of our people. This is going to be looked at 25 years from now as whether or not we stepped up to the challenge, because there's a lot of—lot of autocracies that are counting on them being able to move more rapidly and successfully in an ever-complicated world than democracies can. We all concluded we're going to prove them wrong.\nAnd now I'm happy to take some questions.\nCecilia Vega of ABC.\nI'll tell you all that when it's over.\nLook, I've been doing this a long time. The last thing anyone would do is negotiate in front of the world press as to how he's going to approach a critical meeting with another adversary and/or someone who could be an adversary. It's the last thing I'm going to do.\nBut I will tell you this: I'm going to make clear to President Putin that there are areas where we can cooperate, if he chooses. And if he chooses not to cooperate and acts in a way that he has in the past, relative to cybersecurity and some other activities, then we will respond. We will respond in kind.\nThere need not be—we should decide where it's in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that. And the areas where we don't agree, make it clear what the red lines are.\nI have met with him. He's bright. He's tough. And I have found that he is a—as they say, when you used to play ball, \"a worthy adversary.\"\nBut the fact is that I will be happy to talk with you when it's over, and not before, about what the discussion will entail.\nNancy Cordes, CBS.\nWhat's your second question?\nEvery world leader here, as a member of NATO, that spoke today—and most of them mentioned it—thanked me for meeting with Putin now. Every single one that spoke. And I think there were probably about 10 or 12 that spoke to it, saying they were happy that I did that—that I was going to do that. And they thought it was thoroughly appropriate that I do, and I had discussions with them about—in the open—about what they thought was important from their perspective and what they thought was not important.\nAnd so the interesting thing is, I know—and I'm not being critical of the press—I really mean this; I give my word—but generically, you all thought, \"Was Biden meeting him too soon?\" I haven't found a world leader who doesn't think it's not soon—it's just soon enough. Everyone that I've spoken to, privately and publicly.\nIt doesn't mean there aren't some out there, but it's not likely that a head of state is going to stand up in front of 29 other heads of state and say, \"Boy, I'm glad you're doing this,\" in effect. So there is a consensus. And they thanked me for being willing to talk with them about the meeting and what I was—what I intended to do.\nSo I haven't found any reluctance. There may be someone, but not in the open today or in the meetings I privately had as well.\nAnd Navalny's death would be another indication that Russia has little or no intention of abiding by basic fundamental human rights. It would be a tragedy. It would do nothing but hurt his relationships with the rest of the world, in my view, and with me.\nJeff Zeleny, CNN.\n[Laughter] To answer the first question—[laughter]—I'm laughing too.\nWell, look, I mean, he has made clear that—the answer is: I believe he has, in the past, essentially acknowledged that he was—there were certain things that he would do or did do.\nBut look, when I was asked that question on air, I answered it honestly. But it's not much of a—I don't think it matters a whole lot, in terms of this next meeting we're about to have.\nI'd verify first and then trust. In other words: Everything would have to be shown to be actually occurring. The—it's not about, you know, trusting; it's about agreeing.\nYou know, when we—when you write treaties with your adversaries, you don't say, \"I trust you.\" You say, \"This is what I expect, and if you violate the agreement you made then, we—the, quote, 'The treaty is off. The agreement is off.'\"\nAnd I'm hoping that—that President Putin concludes that there is some interest, in terms of his own interests, in changing the perception that the world has of him, in terms of whether or not he will engage in behavior that's more consistent with what is considered to be appropriate behavior for a head of state.\nAnne Gearan, the Washington Post.\nWhat I'm saying is them—to them is: Watch me. I mean, I'm not saying anything, quite frankly. I'm just going out—people, as I've said before, don't doubt that I mean what I say, and they believe that I keep my commitments when I say it.\nI'm not making any promises to anyone that I don't believe are overwhelmingly likely to be kept. I think that we're at a moment where—I mean, let me put it this way: You may have had a different view, but I think an awful lot of people thought that my showing up at the G-7 would not produce any kind of enthusiasm about American leadership and about where America was. I would suggest that it didn't turn out that way.\nI would suggest that there is a—the leaders I'm dealing with in NATO and the G-7 are leaders who know our recent history; know, generically, the character of the American people; and know where the vast center of the public stands—not Democrat, Republican—but who we are. We're a decent, honorable nation.\nAnd I think that they have seen things happen, as we have, that shocked them and surprised them that could have happened. But I think they, like I do, believe the American people are not going to sustain that kind of behavior.\nAnd so I—you know, I don't want to get into the statistics, because you know that old phrase of Disraeli's: \"There's three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\" But I think it's appropriate to say that the Republican Party is vastly diminished in numbers; the leadership of the Republican Party is fractured; and the Trump wing of the party is the bulk of the party, but it makes up a significant minority of the American people.\nNow, we'll see. We'll see. I believe that by us standing up and saying what we believe to be the case, not engaging in the overwhelming hyperbole that gets engaged in by so many today, that we—I guess that old expression, \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\"\nWhen we said—when I said I was going to deal with beating the virus and I was going to focus on that and I was going to get millions of shots in people's arms, it wasn't me—I just knew the American people. I knew the kind of help I'd get from the Defense Department, from police departments, from the hospitals, from retired docs, from—I just knew. And look how rapidly we moved.\nNow, we have a group of people who were—everything from the political rejection of the notion of taking a vaccine, to people who were simply afraid of a needle and everything in between. And we have a way to go.\nBut I never doubted that we would be able to generate the kind of support we got and get so many millions of people step up and get vaccinated. So I think it is a shock and surprise that what's happened, in terms of the consequence of President Trump's phony populism, has happened. And it is disappointing that so many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate, who I know know better, have been reluctant to take on, for example, an investigation because they're worried about being primaried.\nBut, at the end of the day, we've been through periods like this in American history before where there has been this reluctance to take a chance on your reelection because of the nature of your party's politics at the moment.\nI think this is passing. I don't mean easily passing. That's why it's so important that I succeed in my agenda—the agenda, whether it's dealing with the vaccine, the economy, infrastructure. It's important that we demonstrate we can make progress and continue to make progress. And I think we're going to be able to do that.\nSo, as I said, the proof will be in where it is, you know, 6 months from now, where we are. But I think you're going to see that there's—that, God willing, we're going to be making progress, and there's going to be a coalescing of a lot of Republicans, particularly younger Republicans who are coming up in the party.\nAnd last question, Sebastian Smith of AFP.\nThe second question is—the answer is no.\nThe first question: It depends on whether they meet the criteria. The fact is, they still have to clean up corruption. The fact is they have to meet other criteria to get into the action plan.\nAnd so it's—you know, school is out on that question. It remains to be seen. In the meantime, we will do all that we can to put Ukraine in the position to be able to continue to resist Russian physical aggression. And it will not just depend on me whether or not we conclude that Ukraine can become part of NATO; it will depend on the alliance and how they vote.\nBut I know, for one thing, there has to be a—they have to convince, and it's not easy. I made a speech, years ago, to the Rada saying that Ukraine had an opportunity to do something that's never occurred in the history of Ukraine: actually generate a democratically elected and not corrupt—led by oligarchies in any of the regions—nation. And I pointed out to them when I made that speech that they will go down in history as the founding fathers of Ukraine if in fact they do that.\nThey have more to do. But that does not justify—the fact they have more to do—Russia taking aggressive action, either in the Donbas or in—on the sea, or in any part of Ukraine. And we're going to put Ukraine in a position to be able to maintain their physical security.\nThank you all so very much. Sorry you're all here so late. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-brussels-belgium-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Geneva, Switzerland", "Date": "2021-06-16", "Text": "It's been a long day for you all. [Laughter] I know it was easy getting into the premeeting. There was no problem getting through those doors, was it—was there?\nAnyway, hello, everyone. Well, I've just finished the last meeting of this week's long trip, the U.S.-Russian summit. And I know there were a lot of hype around this meeting, but it's pretty straightforward to me, the meeting. One, there is no substitute, as those of you who have covered me for a while know, for a face-to-face dialogue between leaders. None. And President Putin and I had a—share a unique responsibility to manage the relationship between two powerful and proud countries, a relationship that has to be stable and predictable. And it should be able to—we should be able to cooperate where it's in our mutual interests.\nAnd where we have differences, I wanted President Putin to understand why I say what I say and why I do what I do and how we'll respond to specific kinds of actions that harm America's interests.\nNow, I told President Putin my agenda is not against Russia or anyone else, it's for the American people: fighting COVID-19; rebuilding our economy; reestablishing relationships around the world with our allies and friends; and protecting our people. That's my responsibility as President.\nI also told him that no President of the United States could keep faith with the American people if they did not speak out to defend our democratic values, to stand up for the universal rights and fundamental freedoms that all men and women have, in our view. That's just part of the DNA of our country.\nSo human rights is going to always be on the table, I told him. It's not about just going after Russia when they violate human rights, it's about who we are. How could I be the President of the United States of America and not speak out against the violation of human rights?\nI told him that, unlike other countries, including Russia, we're uniquely a product of an idea. You've heard me say this before, again and again, but I'm going to keep saying it. What's that idea? We don't derive our rights from the government; we possess them because we're born—period. And we yield them to a government.\nAnd so, at the forum, I pointed out to him that that's why we're going raise our concerns about cases like Alexei Navalny. I made it clear to President Putin that we'll continue to raise issues of fundamental human rights because that's what we are, that's who we are. The idea is: \"We hold these truths self-evident that all men\"—and women—we haven't lived up to it completely, but we've always widened the arc of commitment and included more and more people.\nAnd I raised the case of two wrongfully imprisoned American citizens: Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed. I also raised the ability of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty to operate and the importance of a free press and freedom of speech. I made it clear that we will not tolerate attempts to violate our democratic sovereignty or destabilize our democratic elections, and we would respond.\nThe bottom line is, I told President Putin that we need to have some basic rules of the road that we can all abide by.\nI also said there are areas where there's a mutual interest for us to cooperate, for our people—Russian and American people—but also for the benefit of the world and the security of the world. One of those areas is strategic stability.\nYou asked me many times what was I going to discuss with Putin. Before I came, I told you I only negotiate with the individual. And now I can tell you what I was intending to do all along, and that is to discuss and raise the issue of strategic stability and try to set up a mechanism whereby we dealt with it.\nWe discussed in detail the next steps our countries need to take on arms control measures—the steps we need to take to reduce the risk of unintended conflict.\nAnd I'm pleased that he agreed today to launch a bilateral strategic stability dialogue, diplomatic speak for saying, get our military experts and our diplomats together to work on a mechanism that can lead to control of new and dangerous and sophisticated weapons that are coming on the scene now that reduce the times of response, that raise the prospects of accidental war. And we went into some detail of what those weapons systems were.\nAnother area we spent a great deal of time on was cyber and cybersecurity. I talked about the proposition that certain critical infrastructure should be off limits to attack—period—by cyber or any other means. I gave them a list, if I'm not mistaken—I don't have it in front of me—16 specific entities; 16 defined as critical infrastructure under U.S. policy, from the energy sector to our water systems.\nOf course, the principle is one thing. It has to be backed up by practice. Responsible countries need to take action against criminals who conduct ransomware activities on their territory. So we agreed to task experts in both our countries to work on specific understandings about what's off limits and to follow up on specific cases that originate in other countries—either of our countries.\nThere is a long list of other issues we spent time on, from the urgent need to preserve and reopen the humanitarian corridors in Syria so that we can get food—just simple food—and basic necessities to people who are starving to death; how to build it and how it is in the interest of both Russia and the United States to ensure that Iran—Iran—does not acquire nuclear weapons. We agreed to work together there because it's as much interest—Russia's interest as ours. And to how we can ensure the Arctic remains a region of cooperation rather than conflict.\nI caught part of President's—Putin's press conference, and he talked about the need for us to be able to have some kind of modus operandi where we dealt with making sure the Arctic was, in fact, a free zone.\nAnd to how we can each contribute to the shared effort of preventing a resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan. It's very much in the interest of Russia not to have a resurgence of terrorism in Afghanistan.\nThere are also areas that are more challenging. I communicated the United States unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. We agreed to pursue diplomacy related to the Minsk agreement. And I shared our concerns about Belarus. He didn't disagree with what happened; he just has a different perspective of what to do about it.\nBut I know you have a lot of questions, so let me close with this: It was important to meet in person so there can be no mistake about or misrepresentations about what I wanted to communicate.\nI did what I came to do: Number one, identify areas of practical work our two countries can do to advance our mutual interests and also benefit the world. Two, communicate directly—directly—that the United States will respond to actions that impair our vital interests or those of our allies. And three, to clearly lay out our country's priorities and our values so he heard it straight from me.\nAnd I must tell you, the tone of the entire meetings—I guess it was a total of 4 hours—was good, positive. There wasn't any—any strident action taken. Where we disagreed—I disagreed, stated where it was. Where he disagreed, he stated. But it was not done in a hyperbolic atmosphere. That is too much of what's been going on.\nOver this last week, I believe—I hope—the United States has shown the world that we are back, standing with our allies. We rallied our fellow democracies to make concert—concerted commitments to take on the biggest challenges our world faces.\nAnd now we've established a clear basis on how we intend to deal with Russia and the U.S.-Russian relationship. There's much more work ahead. I'm not suggesting that any of this is done, but we've gotten a lot of business done on this trip.\nAnd before I take your questions, I want to say one last thing. Folks, look, this is about how we move from here. This is—I listened to, again, a significant portion of what President Putin's press conference was, and as he pointed out, this is about practical, straightforward, no-nonsense decisions that we have to make or not make.\nWe'll find out within the next 6 months to a year whether or not we actually have a strategic dialogue that matters. We'll find out whether we work to deal with everything from release of people in Russian prisons or not. We'll find out whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order.\nBecause, look, the countries that most are likely to be damaged—failure to do that—are the major countries. For example, when I talked about the pipeline that cyber hit for $5 million—that ransomware hit in the United States, I looked at him and I said, \"Well, how would you feel if ransomware took on the pipelines from your oil fields?\" He said it would matter. This is not about just our self-interest, it's about a mutual self-interest.\nI'll take your questions. And as usual, folks, they gave me a list of the people I'm going to call on.\nSo, Jonathan [Jonathan Lemire], Associated Press.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Cyber Attacks/Russian Election Interference\nWhether I stopped it from happening again—he knows I will take action, like we did when—this last time out. What happened was: We, in fact, made it clear that we were not going to continue to allow this to go on. The end result was, we ended up withdrawing—they went withdrawing Ambassadors, and we closed down some of their facilities in the United States, et cetera. And he knows there are consequences.\nNow, look, one of the consequences that I know—I don't know; I shouldn't say this; it's unfair of me—I suspect you may all think doesn't matter, but I'm confidence it matters to him—confident it matters to him and other world leaders of big nations: his credibility worldwide shrinks.\nLet's get this straight: How would it be if the United States were viewed by the rest of the world as interfering with the elections directly of other countries, and everybody knew it? What would it be like if we engaged in activities that he is engaged in? It diminishes the standing of a country that is desperately trying to make sure it maintains its standing as a major world power.\nAnd so it's not just what I do, it's what the actions that other countries take—in this case, Russia—that are contrary to international norms. It's the price they pay. They are not—they are not—able to dictate what happens in the world. There are other nations of significant consequence, i.e. the United States of America being one of them.\nI made it clear to him that I believe the consequences of that would be devastating for Russia.\nI'll go back to the same point: What do you think happens when he's saying, \"It's not about hurting Navalny,\" this—you know, all the stuff he says to rationalize the treatment of Navalny—and then he dies in prison?\nI pointed out to him that it matters a great deal when a country, in fact—and they asked me why I thought that it was important to continue to have problems with the President of Syria. I said: \"Because he's in violation of an international norm. It's called a Chemical Weapons Treaty. Can't be trusted.\" It's about trust. It's about their ability to influence other nations in a positive way.\nLook, would you like to trade our economy for Russia's economy? Would you like to trade? And by the way, we talked about trade. I don't have any problem with doing business with Russia, as long as they do it based upon international norms. It's in our interest to see the Russian people do well economically. I don't have a problem with that.\nBut if they do not act according to international norms, then guess what? That will not—that only won't it happen with us, it will not happen with other nations. And he kind of talked about that—didn't he, today?—about how the need to reach out to other countries to invest in Russia. They won't as long as they are convinced that, in fact, the violations—for example, the American businessman who was in house arrest. And I had pointed out: \"You want to get American business to invest? Let him go. Change the dynamic.\" Because American businessmen, they're not ready to show up. They don't want to hang around in Moscow.\nI mean, I—look, guys, I know we make foreign policy out to be this great, great skill that somehow is, sort of, like a secret code. Practical—all foreign policy is, is a logical extension of personal relationships. It's the way human nature functions.\nAnd understand, when you run a country that does not abide by international norms, and yet you need those international norms to be somehow managed so that you can participate in the benefits that flow from them, it hurts you. That's not a satisfying answer: \"Biden said he'd invade Russia.\" You know, it is not—you know. By the way, that was a joke. [Laughter] That's not true. But my generic point is, it is—it is more complicated than that.\nDavid Sanger [New York Times]. I thought I saw David. There he is.\nPresident Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/U.S. Cyber Capabilities/Russian Economy\nWith your permission, I'm going to take my coat off. The sun is hot.\nLet me answer your first—well, I'll second question, first.\nI pointed out to him that we have significant cyber capability. And he knows it. He doesn't know exactly what it is, but it's significant. And if in fact they violate these basic norms, we will respond with cyber. He knows.\nIn the cyber way.\nNumber two, I think that the last thing he wants now is a cold war. Without quoting him—which I don't think is appropriate—let me ask a rhetorical question: You got a multithousand-mile border with China. China is moving ahead, hellbent on election, as they say, seeking to be the most powerful economy in the world and the largest and the most powerful military in the world.\nYou're in a situation where your economy is struggling, you need to move it in a more aggressive way, in terms of growing it. And you—I don't think he's looking for a cold war with the United States.\nI don't think it's about a—as I said to him, I said: \"Your generation and mine are about 10 years apart. This is not a 'kumbaya' moment, as you used to say back in the sixties in the United States, like, 'Let's hug and love each other.' But it's clearly not in anybody's interest—your country's or mine—for us to be in a situation where we're in a new cold war.\" And I truly believe he thinks that—he understands that.\nBut that does not mean he's ready to, quote, figuratively speaking, \"lay down his arms,\" and say, \"Come on.\" He still, I believe, is concerned about being, quote, \"encircled.\" He still is concerned that we, in fact, are looking to take him down, et cetera. He still has those concerns, but I don't think they are the driving force as to the kind of relationship he's looking for with the United States.\nYes.\nYes. Yes, yes, and yes. Let me go back to the first part.\nThe reason it didn't go longer is: When is the last time two heads of state have spent over 2 hours in direct conversation across a table, going into excruciating detail? You may know of a time; I don't. I can't think of one.\nSo we didn't need, as we got through, when we brought in the larger group—our defense, our intelligence, and our foreign—well, our—my Foreign Minister—wasn't the Foreign Minister—my Secretary of State was with me the whole time—our Ambassador, et cetera. We brought everybody in. We had covered so much.\nAnd so there was a summary done by him and by me of what we covered. Lavrov and Blinken talked about what we had covered. We raised things that required more amplification or made sure we didn't have any misunderstandings. And so it was, kind of—after 2 hours, there, we looked at each other like, \"Okay, what next?\"\nWhat is going to happen next is, we're going to be able to look back—look ahead in 3 to 6 months, and say: \"Did the things we agreed to sit down and try to work out, did it work? Do we—are we closer to a major strategic stability talks and progress? Are we further along in terms of\"—and go down the line. That's going to be the test.\nI'm not sitting here saying because the President and I agreed that we would do these things, that all of a sudden, it's going to work. I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is, I think there's a genuine prospect to significantly improve the relations between our two countries without us giving up a single, solitary thing based on principle and/or values.\nNo, no, no. No. There were no threats. There were—as a matter of fact, I heard he quoted my mom and quoted other people today. There was—it was very, as we say—which will shock you, coming from me—somewhat colloquial. And we talked about basic, basic, fundamental things. There was a—it was—and you know how I am: I explain things based on personal basis. \"What happens if,\" for example.\nAnd so there are no threats, just simple assertions made. And no \"Well, if you do that, then we'll do this\"—wasn't anything I said. It was just letting him know where I stood; what I thought we could accomplish together; and what, in fact—if it was—if there were violations of American sovereignty, what would we do.\nNo, he asked us about Afghanistan. He said that he hopes that we're able to maintain some peace and security, and I said, \"That has a lot to do with you.\" He indicated that he was prepared to, quote, \"help\" on Afghanistan—I won't go into detail now; and help on Iran; and help on—and, in return, we told him what we wanted to do relative to bringing some stability and economic security or physical security to the people of Syria and Libya.\nSo we had those discussions.\nYamiche [Yamiche Alcindor, PBS News].\nRansomware Attacks on U.S. Companies/Russia\nWell, it's going to be real easy. They either—for example, on cybersecurity, are we going to work out where they take action against ransomware criminals on Russian territory? They didn't do it. I don't think they planned it, in this case. And they—are they going to act? We'll find out.\nWill we commit—what can we commit to act in terms of anything affecting violating international norms that negatively affects Russia? What are we going to agree to do? And so I think we have real opportunities to move.\nAnd I think that one of the things that I noticed when we had the larger meeting is that people who are very, very well-informed started thinking, \"You know, this could be a real problem.\" What happens if that ransomware outfit were sitting in Florida or Maine and took action, as I said, on their single lifeline to their economy: oil? That would be devastating. And they're, like—you could see them kind of go—not that we would do that—but like, \"Whoa.\"\nSo it's in—it's in everybody's interest that these things be acted on. We'll see, though, what happens from these groups we put together.\nStorming of U.S. Capitol on January 6/Political Activism in Russia\n[Laughter] The third one, yes. Go ahead.\n[Laughter] My response is kind of what I communicated—that I think that's a—that's a ridiculous comparison. It's one thing for literally criminals to break through cordon, go into the Capitol, kill a police officer, and be held unaccountable than it is for people objecting and marching on the Capitol and saying: \"You are not allowing me to speak freely. You are not allowing me to do A, B, C, or D.\"\nAnd so they're very different criteria.\nHe's satisfied. Why would I bring it up again? [Laughter]\nLook, this is not about trust; this is about self-interest and verification of self-interest. That's what it's about. So I—virtually almost—almost anyone that I would work out an agreement with that affected the American people's interests, I don't say: \"Well, I trust you. No problem.\" Let's see what happens.\nYou know, as that old expression goes, \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\" We're going to know shortly.\nIgor [Igor Sevryugin], Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.\nYou want to go on the shade? You can't—can you see?\nAll right.\nYes.\nYes.\nI wouldn't put it that way, in terms of improving the climate. I would, in fact, put it in terms of how much interest does he have in burnishing Russia's reputation that is not—is viewed as not being contrary to democratic principles and free speech.\nThat's a judgment I cannot make. I don't know. But it's not because I think he is interested in changing the nature of a closed society or closed government's actions relative to what he thinks is the right of government to do what it does; it's a very different approach.\nAnd you know, there's a couple of really good biographies—I told him I read a couple—I read most everything he's written and the speeches he's made. And I've read a couple of very good biographies, which many of you have as well.\nAnd I think I pointed out to him that Russia had an opportunity—that brief shining moment after Gorbachev and after things began to change drastically—to actually generate a democratic government. But what happened was, it failed and there was a great, great race among Russian intellectuals to determine what form of government would they choose and how would they choose it.\nAnd based on what I believe, Mr. Putin decided was that Russia has always been a major international power when it's been totally united as a Russian state, not based on ideology—whether it was going back to Tsar and commissar, straight through to the revolution—the Russian Revolution, and to where they are today.\nAnd I think that it's clear to me—and I've said it—that I think he decided that the way for Russia to be able to sustain itself as a great—quote, \"great power\" is to in fact unite the Russian people on just the strength of the government—the government controls—not necessarily ideologically, but the government.\nAnd I think that's the choice that was made. I think it—I'm not going to second guess whether it could have been fundamentally different. But I do think it does not lend itself to Russia maintaining itself as one of the great powers in the world.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nNo, we didn't talk about military response.\nLet's get something straight. We know each other well; we're not old friends. It's just pure business.\nThe impact—the world's attitude toward China as it develops. China is trying very hard to project itself as a responsible and a very, very forthcoming nation; that they are trying very hard to talk about how they're taking and helping the world in terms of COVID-19 and vaccines. And they're trying very hard.\nLook, certain things you don't have to explain to the people of the world. They see the results. Is China really actually trying to get to the bottom of this?\nOne thing we did discuss, as I told you, in the EU and at the G-7 and with NATO: What we should be doing and what I'm going to make an effort to do is rally the world to work on what is going to be the physical mechanism available to detect, early on, the next pandemic and have a mechanism by which we can respond to it and respond to it early. It's going to happen. It's going to happen. And we need to do that.\nThank you.\nThe families of the detained Americans, I have hope for.\nI said the families of the detained Americans came up and we discussed it. We're going to follow through with that discussion. I am not going to walk away on that issue.\nI didn't—I'm not confident he'll change his behavior. Where the hell—what do you do all the time? [Laughter] When did I say I was confident? I said——\nI said—what I said was—let's get it straight. I said: What will change their behavior is if the rest of world reacts to them and it diminishes their standing in the world. I'm not confident of anything; I'm just stating a fact.\nIf you don't understand that, you're in the wrong business.\nThank you.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-geneva-switzerland"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Chancellor Angela Merkel Germany", "Date": "2021-07-15", "Text": "Thank you all. Please have a seat. Today it's been my great honor—and I mean that—to welcome a dear friend back to the White House.\nAnd before I say anything else, Chancellor Merkel, I want to express to you and to the people of Germany my sincere condolences and the condolences of the American people for the devastating loss of life and the destruction due to the flooding over the past 24 hours in Germany and neighboring countries. It's a tragedy, and our heart goes out—our hearts go out to the families who've lost loved ones.\nChancellor Merkel has been here frequently over the past 16 years. Matter of fact, she knows the Oval Office as well as I do. She's been—but all kidding aside, through—though this administration—she's been there for 4 years—or for four Presidents.\nBut I want to take a moment to acknowledge the historic nature of her Chancellorship. First woman chancellor in German history. The first Chancellor from the former East Germany. And now, the second largest—longest serving Chancellor since Helmut Kohl. Here's an exemplary life of groundbreaking service to Germany and, I might add—and I mean it from the bottom of my heart—to the world.\nOn behalf of the United States, thank you, Angela, for your career of strong, principled leadership. And thank you for speaking out for what is right and for never failing to defend human dignity.\nAnd I want to thank you for your continued support for the longstanding goal of a Europe whole, free, and at peace. You've been a stalwart champion of the transatlantic alliance, the Atlantic partnership. Under your Chancellorship, the friendship and cooperation between Germany and the United States has grown stronger and stronger.\nAnd I'm looking forward to celebrating more at our dinner this evening, but today was very much a working visit. Chancellor Merkel and I covered a wide range of issues where Germany and United States are working to advance a shared agenda. We discussed, together with our fellow major democracies at the G-7, Germany and the United States have responsibilities to lead with our values, as do the other members of NATO.\nAnd today I've confided that in our new Washington Declaration, which we've codified—a document affirming our commitment to the democratic principles that are the heart—that are at the heart of both of our nations, and how we will apply them to meet the biggest challenges of today and tomorrow.\nBoth our nations—both our nations—understand the imperative of proving that democracies can deliver the needs of our people in the second quarter of the 21st century. We will stand up for democratic principles and universal rights when we see China or any other country working to undermine free and open societies.\nAnd we are united—united—in our commitment to addressing democratic backsliding, corruption, phony populism in the European Union or among candidates for the EU membership or anywhere we find it in the world.\nWe agree on the importance of further integrating the Western Balkans into the European—into European institutions and in our continued support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the continued importance of reforms in the support of their Euro-Atlantic aspirations.\nWe stand together and will continue to stand together to defend our Eastern Flank allies at NATO against Russian aggression. And while I reiterated my concerns about Nord Stream 2, Chancellor Merkel and I are absolutely united in our conviction that Russia must not be allowed to use energy as a weapon to coerce or threaten its neighbors.\nAnd today we're launching a climate and energy partnership to support energy security and the development of sustainable energy, sustainable energy technologies, and emerging economies, including in Central Europe and Ukraine.\nTo unite our efforts to upend and—on our global climate ambitions that we have to up the ante, what happened is, we talked about when Paris accord was set, we thought we had established just how serious it was, but things have gotten much more dire since even that date. And to unite our efforts to update and to up the ante on global climate ambitions.\nI also thank Chancellor Merkel for the dedication and the sacrifice of German troops who have served side by side along with U.S. forces in Afghanistan for almost 20 years. And we reaffirmed our shared commitment to continuing to counter terrorist threats where we find them, including in the Sahel in Africa.\nAnd we—when we think about the future, the future we want for the world, there is no issue—there's no issue set at all that, I believe, we find anything other than the certainty that a commitment that—between the United States and Germany doesn't benefit whatever the problem and the concern is.\nWe need to fight COVID-19 pandemic everywhere, to strengthen global health security for tomorrow so we're ready for the next pandemic. We need to make sure that the rules of the road governing the use of emerging technologies advance freedom, not authoritarianism and repression. And we need to promote a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery that enhances the prosperity and opportunity for all. And so much more.\nThis just—this isn't just the work of governments, the work is the work of our peoples, sharing their innovation and insights, joining together to amplify our collective impact. So today we're launching a Futures Forum between our two countries, which will bring together top experts across business, academia, civil society, and more to collaborate as we shape our shared future.\nMadam Chancellor, I know that the partnership between Germany and United States will continue to grow stronger on the foundation that you have helped to build. But on a personal note, I must tell you, I'll miss seeing you at our summits. I truly will.\nSo thank you again, Angela, for making the journey, for our productive meeting today, and for your friendship.\nThank you very much. We're each going to take two questions. And I'm going to begin by recognizing Steve Portnoy [CBS News] and congratulate you on your new role as president of the White House Correspondents Association.\nMy sympathies. [Laughter]No, but thank you.\nYes.\nIn 2 minutes or less. [Laughter] Obviously, I know why they elected you president. [Laughter]\nWell, let me start off by answering the question relative to Haiti and Cuba. And communism is a failed system, a universally failed system. And I don't see socialism as a very useful substitute, but that's another story.\nWith regard to whether—the circumstances in which we would send military troops to Haiti: We—we're only sending American marines to our Embassy to make sure that they are secure and nothing is out of whack at all. But the idea of sending American forces into Haiti is not on the agenda at this moment, number one.\nNumber two, with regard to Cuba: Cuba is a—unfortunately, a failed state and repressing their citizens. There are a number of things that we would consider doing to help the people of Cuba, but it would require a different circumstance or a guarantee that they would not be taken advantage of by the Government—for example, the ability to send remittances to—back to Cuba. I would not do that now because the fact is, it's highly likely that the regime would confiscate those remittances or big chunks of it.\nWith regard to the need COVID on—I mean—excuse me—they have a COVID problem on—in Cuba. I'd be prepared to give significant amounts of vaccine if in fact I was assured an international organization would administer those vaccines and do it in a way that average citizens would have access to those vaccines.\nAnd one of the things that you did not ask, but we're considering is—they've cut off access to the internet. We're considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access.\nAnd I think I've answered your questions. Thank you.\nMy view on Nord Stream 2 has been known for some time. Good friends can disagree. And—but by the time I became President, it was 90-percent completed. And imposing sanctions did not seem to make any sense. It made more sense to work with the Chancellor on finding out how she'd proceed based on whether or not Russia tried to, essentially, blackmail Ukraine in some way.\nAnd so the Chancellor and I have asked our teams to look at practical measures we could take together and whether or not Europe energy security, Ukraine security are actually strengthened or weakened based on Russian actions. And so this is a—we'll see. We'll see.\nThat's all? [Laughter] I thought I said we'd take two questions, but I guess that translated to, we'd take two questions or more from each person called on.\nLet me talk about the business advisory. The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating. And the Chinese Government is not keeping its commitment that it made how it would deal with Hong Kong. And so it is more of an advisory as to what may happen in—on Hong Kong. It's as simple as that and as complicated as that.\nWith regard to \"am I confident?\"—I'm supremely confident that everything is going to work out perfectly in terms—[laughter]. Look, I understand why the press, among others, is skeptical that I can actually get this deal done on infrastructure and on human infrastructure. And I've watched and listened, and the press declared my initiative dead at least 10 times so far.\nI don't think it's dead. I think it's still alive. I still have confidence we're going to be able to get what I proposed and what I've agreed to in the bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. I've gotten—we've each committed—I trust the members of—the Republican Senators who have made the commitments relative to how we should proceed and what would be included in the package for infrastructure. And they're men and women of honor, and I expect they would keep their commitment.\nWith regard to the further issue of what's going on and what will confuse the listening audience—but reconciliation—that is the mechanism by which you have to get every single Democrat to agree to proceed on matters like what I announced today.\nToday—I don't know whether you have any children; it's none of my business whether you do, but if you do, you're going to get—if you're making less than $150,000—you're going to get a significant stipend that is a tax cut. If you have a child under the age of 7 years old, you're going to get—in your bank account today, you're going to get a payment of one-sixth—12 months divided—$3,600—$3,700 for that child divided by 12 every month, just like a Social Security check. It's expected to reduce poverty—child poverty by over 40 percent. And it could be a significant, significant game changer.\nWe have mechanisms to pay for both these mechanisms. And there may be some last-minute discussion as to who—what mechanism is used to pay for each of these items, both the infrastructure package and the human infrastructure package. But I believe we will get it done.\nThank you.\nWe brought in the head of our COVID team because the Chancellor brought that subject up. It's in the process of seeing how soon we can lift the ban—it's in process now. And I'll be able to answer that question to you within the next several days—what is likely to happen. I'm waiting to hear from our folks and our COVID team as to when that should be done. And the Chancellor did raise it. [Laughter]\nHaving been here many times, if we don't leave right now, we're going to miss dinner. Chancellor and I have a dinner with some—a number of folks, and very shortly.\nSo thank you for your attention. And thank you for your questions. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-chancellor-angela-merkel-germany-7"}
{"Title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News", "Date": "2021-08-18", "Text": "Thank you for doin' it.\nI think -- there was no consensus. If you go back and look at the intelligence reports, they said that it's more likely to be sometime by the end of the year. The idea that the tal -- and then it goes further on, even as late as August. I think you're gonna see -- the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others speaking about this later today.\nYeah. Well, the question was whether or not it w-- the idea that the Taliban would take over was premised on the notion that the -- that somehow, the 300,000 troops we had trained and equipped was gonna just collapse, they were gonna give up. I don't think anybody anticipated that.\nWhat -- what did he say was predicted?\nWell, by the end of the year, I said that's that was -- that was a real possibility. But no one said it was gonna take over then when it was bein' asked.\nLook, I don't think it was a fa-- look, it was a simple choice, George. When the-- when the Taliban -- let me back -- put it another way. When you had the government of Afghanistan, the leader of that government get in a plane and taking off and going to another country, when you saw the significant collapse of the ta-- of the-- Afghan troops we had trained -- up to 300,000 of them just leaving their equipment and taking off, that was -- you know, I'm not-- this -- that -- that's what happened.\nThat's simply what happened. So the question was in the beginning the-- the threshold question was, do we commit to leave within the timeframe we've set? We extended it to September 1st. Or do we put significantly more troops in? I hear people say, \"Well, you had 2,500 folks in there and nothin' was happening. You know, there wasn't any war.\"\nBut guess what? The fact was that the reason it wasn't happening is the last president negotiated a year earlier that he'd be out by May 1st and that-- in return, there'd be no attack on American forces. That's what was done. That's why nothing was happening. But the idea if I had said -- I had a simple choice. If I had said, \"We're gonna stay,\" then we'd better prepare to put a whole hell of a lot more troops in --\nNo, they didn't. It was split. Tha-- that wasn't true. That wasn't true.\nNo. Not at -- not in terms of whether we were going to get out in a timeframe all troops. They didn't argue against that.\nNo. No one said that to me that I can recall. Look, George, the reason why it's been stable for a year is because the last president said, \"We're leaving. And here's the deal I wanna make with you, Taliban. We're agreeing to leave if you agree not to attack us between now and the time we leave on May the 1st.\"\nI got into office, George. Less than two months after I elected to office, I was sworn in, all of a sudden, I have a May 1 deadline. I have a May 1 deadline. I got one of two choices. Do I say we're staying? And do you think we would not have to put a hell of a lot more troops? B-- you know, we had hundreds-- we had tens of thousands of troops there before. Tens of thousands.\nDo you think we woulda -- that we would've just said, \"No problem. Don't worry about it, we're not gonna attack anybody. We're okay\"? In the meantime, the Taliban was takin' territory all throughout the country in the north and down in the south, in the Pasthtun area.\nI would've tried to figure out how to withdraw those troops, yes, because look, George. There is no good time to leave Afghanistan. Fifteen years ago would've been a problem, 15 years from now. The basic choice is am I gonna send your sons and your daughters to war in Afghanistan in perpetuity?\nNo one can name for me a time when this would end. And what-- wha-- wha-- what-- what constitutes defeat of the Taliban? What constitutes defeat? Would we have left then? Let's say they surrender like before. OK. Do we leave then? Do you think anybody-- the same people who think we should stay would've said, \"No, good time to go\"? We spent over $1 trillion, George, 20 years. There was no good time to leave.\nNumber one, as you know, the intelligence community did not say back in June or July that, in fact, this was gonna collapse like it did. Number one.\nBut not this quickly. Not even close. We had already issued several thousand passports to the-- the SIVs, the people-- the-- the-- the translators when I came into office before we had negotiated getting out at the end of s-- August.\nSecondly, we're in a position where what we did was took precautions. That's why I authorized that there be 6,000 American troops to flow in to accommodate this exit, number one. And number two, provided all that aircraft in the Gulf to get people out. We pre-positioned all that, anticipated that. Now, granted, it took two days to take control of the airport. We have control of the airport now.\nOh, there is. But, look, b-- but no one's being killed right now, God forgive me if I'm wrong about that, but no one's being killed right now. People are-- we got 1,000-somewhat, 1,200 out, yesterday, a couple thousand today. And it's increasing. We're gonna get those people out.\nThat was four days ago, five days ago.\nWhat I thought was we ha-- we have to gain control of this. We have to move this more quickly. We have to move in a way in which we can take control of that airport. And we did.\nLook, that's like askin' my deceased son Beau, who spent six months in Kosovo and a year in Iraq as a Navy captain and then major-- I mean, as an Army major. And, you know, I'm sure h-- he had regrets comin' out of Afganista-- I mean, out of Iraq.\nHe had regrets to what's-- how-- how it's going. But the idea-- what's the alternative? The alternative is why are we staying in Afghanistan? Why are we there? Don't you think that the one-- you know who's most disappointed in us getting out? Russia and China. They'd love us to continue to have to--\nNo. I-- I don't think it could've been handled in a way that there-- we-- we're gonna go back in hindsight and look, but the idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing, I don't know how that happens. I don't know how that happened.\nYes. Now, exactly what happened-- is not priced in. But I knew that they're gonna have an enormous, enorm-- look, one of the things we didn't know is what the Taliban would do in terms of trying to keep people from getting out, what they would do.What are they doing now? They're cooperating, letting American citizens get out, American personnel get out, embassies get out, et cetera. But they're having-- we're having some more difficulty in having those who helped us when we were in there--\nPardon me?\nWell-- we do know generically and in some specificity what's happening outside of Kabul. We don't know it in great detail. But we do know. And guess what? The Taliban knows if they take on American citizens or American military, we will strike them back like hell won't have it.\nWe're gonna do everything in our power to get all Americans out and our allies out.\nIt depends on where we are and whether we can get-- ramp these numbers up to 5,000 to 7,000 a day coming out. If that's the case, we'll be-- they'll all be out.\nYes.\nYes.\nThat's too high.\nThe estimate we're giving is somewhere between 50,000 and 65,000 folks total, counting their families.\nThe commitment holds to get everyone out that, in fact, we can get out and everyone that should come out. And that's the objective. That's what we're doing now, that's the path we're on. And I think we'll get there.\nNo. Americans should understand that we're gonna try to get it done before August 31st.\nIf -- if we don't, we'll determine at the time who's left.\nAnd if you're American force -- if there's American citizens left, we're gonna stay to get them all out.\nSh-- why wouldn't China say that? Look, George, the idea that w-- there's a fundamental difference between-- between Taiwan, South Korea, NATO. We are in a situation where they are in-- entities we've made agreements with based on not a civil war they're having on that island or in South Korea, but on an agreement where they have a unity government that, in fact, is trying to keep bad guys from doin' bad things to them.\nWe have made-- kept every commitment. We made a sacred commitment to Article Five that if in fact anyone were to invade or take action against our NATO allies, we would respond. Same with Japan, same with South Korea, same with-- Taiwan. It's not even comparable to talk about that.\nWho-- who's gonna say that? Look, before I made this decision, I met with all our allies, our NATO allies in Europe. They agreed. We should be getting out.\nSure, they had a choice. Look, the one thing I promise you in private, NATO allies are not quiet. You remember from your old days. They're not gonna be quiet. And so-- and by the way, you know, what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be putting together a group of the G-7, the folks that we work with the most-- to-- I was on the phone with-- with Angela Merkel today. I was on the phone with the British prime minister. I'm gonna be talking to Macron in France to make sure we have a coherent view of how we're gonna deal from this point on.\nNo. I think-- let me put it this way. I think they're going through sort of an existential crisis about do they want to be recognized by the international community as being a legitimate government. I'm not sure they do. But look, they have--\nWell, they do. But they also care about whether they have food to eat, whether they have an income that they can provide for their f-- that they can make any money and run an economy. They care about whether or not they can hold together the society that they in fact say they care so much about.\nI'm not counting on any of that. I'm not cou-- but that is part of what I think is going on right now in terms of I-- I'm not sure I would've predicted, George, nor would you or anyone else, that when we decided to leave, that they'd provide safe passage for Americans to get out.\nAs many as we can get out, we should. For example, I had a meeting today for a couple hours in the Situation Room just below here. There are Afghan women outside the gate. I told 'em, \"Get 'em on the planes. Get them out. Get them out. Get their families out if you can.\"\nBut here's the deal, George. The idea that we're able to deal with the rights of women around the world by military force is not rational. Not rational. Look what's happened to the Uighurs in western China. Look what's happening in other parts of the world.\nLook what's happenin' in, you know, in-- in the Congo. I mean, there are a lotta places where women are being subjugated. The way to deal with that is not with a military invasion. The way to deal with that is putting economic, diplomatic, and national pre-- international pressure on them to change their behavior.\nIt could be. But George, look, here's the deal. Al Qaeda, ISIS, they metastasize. There's a significantly greater threat to the United States from Syria. There's a significantly greater threat from East Africa. There's significant greater threat to other places in the world than it is from the mountains of Afghanistan. And we have maintained the ability to have an over-the-horizon capability to take them out. We're-- we don't have military in Syria to make sure that we're gonna be protected--\nYeah. I'm confident we're gonna have the overriding capability, yes. Look, George, it's like asking me, you know, am I confident that people are gonna act even remotely rationally. Here's the deal. The deal is the threat from Al Qaeda and their associate organizations is greater in other parts of the world to the United States than it is from Afghanistan.\nNo. That tells me that-- my dad used to have an expression, George. If everything's equally important to you, nothing's important to you. We should be focusing on where the threat is the greatest. And the threat-- the idea-- we can continue to spend $1 trillion and have tens of thousands of American forces in Afghanistan when we have what's going on around the world, in the Middle East and North Africa and west-- I mean, excuse me-- yeah, North Africa and Western Africa. The idea we can do that and ignore those-- those looming problems, growing problems, is not-- not rational.\nNot true. It's not true. They're not gonna look just like they were we were attacked. There was a guy named Osama bin Laden that was still alive and well. They were organized in a big way, that they had significant help from arou-- from other parts of the world.\nWe went there for two reasons, George. Two reasons. One, to get Bin Laden, and two, to wipe out as best we could, and we did, the Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. We did it. Then what happened? Began to morph into the notion that, instead of having a counterterrorism capability to have small forces there in-- or in the region to be able to take on Al Qaeda if it tried to reconstitute, we decided to engage in nation building. In nation building. That never made any sense to me.\nWe should've.\nWell, by the-- what would be messy?\nIf we had gotten out a long time ago-- getting out would be messy no matter when it occurred. I ask you, you want me to stay, you want us to stay and send your kids back to Afghanistan? How about it? Are you g-- if you had a son or daughter, would you send them in Afghanistan now? Or later?\nThey've done it because, in fact, there was a circumstance that was different when we started. We were there for two reasons, George. And we accomplished both ten years ago. We got Osama bin Laden. As I said and got criticized for saying at the time, we're gonna follow him to the gates of hell. Hell, we did--\nOne that we overextended what we needed to do to deal with our national interest. That's like my sayin' they-- they're-- they-- they b-- b-- the border of Tajikistan-- and-- other-- what-- does it matter? Are we gonna go to war because of what's goin' on in Tajikistan? What do you think?\nTell me what-- where in that isolated country that has never, never, never in all of history been united, all the way back to Alexander the Great, straight through the British Empire and the Russians, what is the idea? Are we gonna s-- continue to lose thousands of Americans to injury and death to try to unite that country? What do you think? I think not.\nI think the American people are with me. And when you unite that country, what do you have? They're surrounded by Russia in the north or the Stans in the north. You have-- to the west, they have Iran. To the south, they have Pakistan, who's supporting them. And to the-- and-- actually, the east, they have Pakistan and China. Tell me. Tell me. Is that worth our national interest to continue to spend another $1 trillion and lose thousands more American lives? For what?\nWe're gonna get the booster shots. And-- it's somethin' that I think-- you know, because we g-- w-- we got our shots all the way back in I think December. So it's-- it's-- it's past time. And so the idea (NOISE) that the recommendation-- that's my wife calling. (LAUGH) No. (LAUGH) But all kiddin' aside, yes, we will get the booster shots.\nAbsolutely because we're providing more to the rest of the world than all the rest of the world combined. We got enough for everybody American, plus before this year is-- before we get to the middle of next year, we're gonna provide a half a billion shots to the rest of the world. We're keepin' our part of the bargain. We're doin' more than anybody.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-2"}
{"Title": "Interview with Anderson Cooper of CNN in Baltimore, Maryland", "Date": "2021-10-21", "Text": "Good to see you (ph).\nNo problem, it's all done.\nNo, look Anderson, we've been, I've probably spent, well, well over a hundred hours -- this is a big deal. We both have, we have two plans. One is the infrastructure plan for roads, highway, bridges, buses, trains, et cetera. And the other one is what I call the Care Economy, has a lot of money in there for the environmental remediation as well as Care Economy.\nFor example, you know, we want to get the economy moving. But millions of women can't go to work because they don't have any childcare, that kind of thing. So there's a lot of pieces in there. There's lots that people don't understand. And by the way, all of it's paid for. Every single penny, it's not going to raise one single cent.\nI think so. You know look, I've been -- I was a senator for 370 years --\nAnd I was never, I was relatively good at putting together deals.\nNo. No. I think banning assault weapons is the toughest deal I worked on --\nAnd succeeded.\nYes.\nSure. You know it's like my asking you, are you sure your next show's going to be a success.\nHey look, it's all about compromise. You know, it's -- \"compromise\" has become a dirty word. But it's bipartisanship and compromise still has to be possible. When I ran for the presidency and I said I'm running for three reasons; one to restore the soul and decency in the country; two to build the middle-class and working- class so that we build from the middle out; and three to actually unite the country.\nAnd everybody's been say well that's crazy, you can't do it. If we can't eventually unite this country, we're in deep trouble.\nI do think I'll get a deal.\nMorgan State, Morgan State, all right man --.\nI've spoken there.\nWell, let me ask you, do you -- how old are your kids?\nGod love you.\nWell look, there's two pieces. There is the childcare, having someone take care of your child while you are working, while you and your wife are working. Under this proposal I have, no one will have to pay unless you're making more than individually you're each making you know, maybe making over 300 grand, $150,000 apiece --\nOh gosh.\nBy the way, I'm married to one, Dr. Biden right here.\nincome for childcare, seven percent. And the way we do that is we provide for the ability to have childcare centers funded, the money won't even go to you, you don't, you figure your income, you get seven percent with the total cost.\nBut there's another piece here. You now are qualified to be able to have a Child Tax Credit. It used to be that when you, you know when you if you had enough money to pay significant taxes, you could write off 2000 bucks for every child you had and reduce from your taxes. But if you were making 60,000 bucks a year you didn't have that much to write off. You didn't get anything.\nWell, I call this a \"tax break\" for middle-class people.\nIf you're making in the $150,000 range right now, you're in a situation where you can get, if you have a child under seven, $350. If you have a child over seven, between seven and 17, you can get $300. And you get a direct payment. The IRS sends you money.\nNo. Here's the deal. All these people are working anyway.\nAnd by the way you know why should somebody who is not working and has, you know, makes -- has a million-dollar trust fund, why should they get the benefit and someone making 60 grand and not working but staying home, why should they not get anything? I don't get that.\nThat's a different issue.\nYeah.\nYeah, it is down to four weeks. And the reason it's down to four weeks, I can't get 12 weeks.\nBut no, here's the deal, guys. How many people do you know, not\na joke, or maybe yourself, have had a circumstance where you are working like a devil, you're making several bucks an hour, 15 bucks an hour, 20 bucks an hour and you have a child that's sick at home or you have a mother or father, husband or wife, son or daughter and you need to stay home to help them?\nWe're one of the few industrial countries in the world that doesn't have paid leave. So that when you stay home to help that person, to take care of that person, you're still getting your pay. And it does not hurt the business at all. The business isn't paying for it.\nThe federal government is paying for it. It's a little bit like as I said a tax cut for people who are not able to otherwise take care of their families. And look, I'm looking out here. And a lot of you are part of that families' (ph) generation. You have young kids. And you have aging parents. And one of the things all the polling data shows, Anderson --\n-- is people are more concerned about taking care of the elderly because they don't know what to do, than they are even their children.\nGod love you.\nThere you go.\n-- if my mom were here, she'd say you're a good daughter, number one.\nNumber two, I was in a situation like you are. I was making more money. I was making $42,000 a year as a senator at the time, although I was listed the Poorest Man in the Senate for 36 years. But I still made more money than most people because the Senate salaries kept going up.\nWhat happened was my dad got sick. And he was in hospice so Jill and I took my dad home. And we took care of him in our house. But we were lucky because we had the ability to have -- I have a sister who's an angel and a brother who's a wonderful guy. And we all took turns in our house taking care of them.\nBut here's the deal. Right now, under Medicaid, there are 860,000, I think it's 860, don't hold me to the exact number, it's over 800,000 who qualify for home health care aid for their parents. But there's no money there. There's no money there.\nSo what we do is we provide the funding for Medicaid to allow you to be able to keep, if your parents have their home, keeping them in their home if you want it, or get help in your home with home care from professionals providing, helping you take care of them, helping you take care of them.\nAnd in many cases where you're not taking care of them in your own home and they're staying in their home, you're going to be able to have the ability to have someone come in and make their meals for them. Not to be there 24/7.\nSo there's a lot of things we're doing. And in addition to the process, we're going to be able to train up those home care workers who are usually minority women and women of color as well as immigrants.\nAnd they have the capacity to learn more as they go along, to move to the point where they can become practical nurses and things like that. So it makes a lot of sense, and it's cheaper -- cheaper than it is to not do it.\nThat's a reach. And the reason why it's a reach, it's not -- I think it's a good idea. And it's not that costly in relative terms -- especially if we allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices.\nBut here's the thing. Mr. Manchin is -- is opposed to that, as is, I think, Senator Sinema, is opposed to...\nOpposed to all three. Because they don't want -- he says he doesn't want to further burden Medicare so that -- because it will run out of its ability to maintain itself in the next number of years. There's ways to fix that, but he's not interested in that part, either.\nBut, look, Joe -- Joe's not a bad guy. I mean, he's a friend. And he's always, at the end of the day, come around and voted for it.\nBut -- but here's the point. We're in a situation now where, if you are in a circumstance that you're not able to provide -- let me cut to the chase. I'm taking too long.\nOne of the things we're able to do, in the meantime, is the most expensive of these things would be dental, OK?\nNow, we're talking about -- I don't have a deal on it yet -- maybe getting an $800 voucher from Medicare for dental work that you may need. And the hearing is a very important thing because, as Kyrsten Sinema, who supports this, points out, hearing is directly related to dementia. When you can't hear, you have a problem. And it impacts on dementia.\nSo -- so we're able to -- and it's cheaper to be able to take care of hearing. But I think I've been able to take care of that without changing Medicare, because what's happening is now you have these hearing aid companies, you no longer are going to have to go to the doctor and spend five grand and get an appointment. You can go by Walgreens and buy over-the-counter hearing aids. So...\nA harder one, though, is we haven't gotten a consensus yet on how to deal with seeing -- glasses. And -- but that's -- so it's not done yet is the answer.\nBy the way, Ben, the Bidens all hail from Baltimore, beginning in 1850.\nI don't know how the hell they kicked me out. But I'm...\nWell, I think what's fair is that the present tax code, the highest tax rate is 35 percent, number one, OK?\nNumber two, you're in a circumstance where corporate America is not paying their fair share. And I come from the corporate state of the world, Delaware -- more corporations in Delaware than every other state in the union combined, OK?\nNow, here's the deal, though. You have 55 corporations, for example, in the United States of America, making over $40 billion, don't pay a cent -- not a single little red cent.\nNow, I don't care -- I'm a capitalist. I hope you can be a millionaire or a billionaire. I -- not a -- but at least pay your fair share. Chip in a little bit.\nLet me follow up. Because Kyrsten Sinema, who you mentioned, Senator Sinema, is opposed to any tax rate hikes for corporations and for high earners.\nSpeaker Pelosi suggested today she could accept that. The question is, A, would you accept that, no rate hikes, tax rate hikes for corporations or high earners?\nAnd if so, how would you pay for this plan otherwise?\nBecause you don't have to -- look, here's the deal. The tax rate, the corporate tax rate, was 35 point -- 37 percent. Barack and I thought it should come down. We thought it should come down to 28 percent.\nIn the process, it came down to 21 percent under Trump -- which even the corporate leaders, and you know if you're in real estate, major real estate, ask them. They know they should be paying a little more than 21 percent.\nBecause the idea that, if you're a schoolteacher and a firefighter, you're paying at a higher tax rate than they are, as a percentage of your taxes.\nBut here's the deal. I believe that we can do the -- we can pay for this whole thing. I have it written on a card here, but I won't bore you with the detail.\nBut, for example, if you in fact made sure that you paid a minimum 15 percent -- minimum 15 percent -- if you're paying nothing. Minimum 15 percent, that's almost -- that's over, almost $400 billion over 10 years.\nNo. No. I don't think we're going to be able to get the -- look...\n... when -- when you're in the United States Senate and you're president of the United States and you have 50 Democrats, every one is a president...\n[21:16] ... every single one. So you've got to work things out.\nBut where I am is I'm hearing now -- I'll turn on the news and I'll hear that \"Biden's caved on such\" -- look, Biden has a simple proposition. Biden's going to get -- all the elements of these two bills have profound impact on economic growth, reduce not create inflation, don't add a penny to the debt, as well as grow the economy, according -- I had 17 Nobel laureates in Economics sent me a letter recently that saying my proposals would actually reduce inflation, diminish inflation.\nBut here's the point. The point of it all is that I'm prepared -- I can't think of anything that was consequential and changing the circumstance for the middle class and working class in America that came as a consequence of a single piece of legislation.\nI've got a portrait of Roosevelt in my office, OK? Social Security is not anything like it is today when he passed it. It evolved. It moved. It grew.\n[20:17] So I'm prepared to do the things that can get done now, that can begin to change the lives of ordinary Americans, to give them a fighting chance, and come back and try to get others later.\nAnd, by the way, I've got another English professor, who teaches writing here.\n[20:18] First of all, Professor, you made a very profound point. I'm not being sarcastic. And that is -- and Jill uses a slightly different phrase. Any country that out-educates us will out- compete us. Any country that out-educates -- out-educates will out- compete us.\nYou have the vast majority of the 37 major countries in the world, economies, we rank 35 in our investment in education.\nWe're in a situation where, if you -- if you think about it, when we -- what caused us to move ahead and dominate the 20th century, in the late 1900s -- early 1900s, late 1890s, we came up with, said, 12 years of free education. That was revolutionary at the time. I mean, seriously.\nNow, if we were sitting down today and saying, \"Oh, we've got to put together an education system,\" raise your hand if anybody thinks 12 years is enough to compete in the 21st century.\n[20:19] So that's why what I propose is free child -- free school -- preschool for every three three and four-year-old in America, no matter what their background.\nAll the data shows that, no matter what home they come from, they increase exponentially their prospects of succeeding all the way through 12 years of school.\nYou know -- you know all the statistics. The statistics go that, if you come from a home where there's no books in the home and a single mom or a single dad, they don't -- they're not well-educated, they don't talk a lot, the kid from a middle -- average middle-class home versus that home will go to school having heard 1 million more words spoken than the child who didn't -- a gigantic disadvantage.\nWell, I know...\nOh, I -- yeah. And I'm going to get it done.\nAnd if I don't, I'll be sleeping alone for a long time.\nBut here's the deal. So far, Mr. Manchin and one other person has indicated that they will not support free community college.\nSo, what I -- what I think we can get done is, we can significantly increase the amount of money, by 500 bucks a payment, for Pell Grants. And Pell Grants are available, and they can apply for up to 30 percent of the cost of community college and/or, and/or college, help tuition.\nSo, it's not going to get us there. It's not going to get us the whole thing. But it is a start. I'm convinced, absolutely, positively convinced, that we're going to be able to -- and, by the way, we have in the law -- in the legislation money for community colleges that deal with -- dealing with apprenticeships, dealing with teaching people particular skills that are not getting -- will not get you a two-year degree, but will teach you the skill.\nSo, I think we can get all of that done this time out.\nBut I promise you, I guarantee you we're going to get free community college in the next several years across the board.\nWell, the White House has a lot of bedrooms.\nAnd she went like this, down the hall.\nNo, look, it really makes a gigantic difference. And think of this. You have more countries in the world with having --\nproviding college -- I mean, providing professional education beyond 12 years. We rank like -- I think it's -- don't hold me to the number. I think it's 16 or 17 in the world, the United States of America, for God's sake.\nThis is about putting us in the game.\nWhere are you?\nAll these Morgan men, man.\nI have spoken there a couple of times. And, by the way, the guy who runs my operation is a -- anyway.\nI keep talking about Delaware State, but they keep saying about Morgan State.\nWell, two reasons.\nIf you notice, the Republicans haven't passed a single, solitary thing. Zero. So, usher through their agenda -- their agenda right now is just stop Biden, although I shouldn't make it so personal. Stop my administration. That's what the agenda is.\nIt's much easier to stop something than to start something. And, look, what we did is, when I wrote -- I'm going to back up just a second. I apologize.\nI wrote -- I personally, during the campaign, before I got elected, I wrote the infrastructure bill relating to what we do to highways and all that kind of thing, hard data. And I wrote the what they call -- what's now called the care economy piece, and it has a gigantic piece of environmental pieces in it too.\nAnd I went before the joint session of Congress, and I laid out exactly what I was for. And so I made it clear what I was for.\nInitially, what happened was, I got no support for anything from our Republican friends. And then they said, maybe we can work out a bipartisan deal on infrastructure. And we did. We worked on it. It didn't give me everything I wanted. It didn't have as much money in there for the environment, although it has tens of billions of dollars in there. But it didn't have what I wanted in it.\nBut we made a bipartisan deal. Now what's coming along is this reconciliation, they call it, a fancy word for the other pieces, that have the child care pieces, have the economy, that relates to allowing people to -- women to go back to work. It has about $450 billion for environmental remediation and so on. And that's the one that is the issue.\nNo.\nFirst of all, she's smart as the devil, number one.\nNumber two, she's very supportive of the environmental agenda in my legislation, very supportive. She's supportive of all -- almost all of the things I mentioned relating to everything from family care to all -- to all those issues.\nWhere she's not supportive is, she says she will not raise a single penny in taxes on the corporate side and/or on wealthy people, period. And so that's where it sort of breaks down. And there's a few other issues it breaks down on.\nBut what we're trying to do is reach a point here where I'm able to present to the Senate, able to vote on, and the House, a serious, serious piece of legislation that changes the dynamic for working- class folks in America and middle-class folks and begins to have the very wealthy and corporations just begin to pay their fair share, not a lot.\nHow we get there, we're down to four or five issues, which I'm not going to negotiate on national television, as you might guess.\nNo, no, no, no, no. Oh, I know.\nBut all kidding aside, I think we can get there.\nMr. President.\nKOBI KHONG, SOPHOMORE CLASS PRESIDENT, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY: One of the largest issues that people have trouble comprehending the severity of is climate change.\nMany legislators and politicians today are lenient, as they won't have to live with the future effects. Without the legislative support for the climate aspects of your budget proposal and the Earth rapidly approaching the Paris agreement's 1.5 degrees limit, what other backup plans do you have to ensure a future for the next generations?\nWell, that's...\nMr. President, you got it right.\nThe existential threat to humanity is climate change. And when President Trump pulled out of the Paris accord, which, when I was with the Obama administration, we helped negotiate, the agreement was that we could not -- if we reached beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius increase in temperature, we're gone. Not a joke. Not a joke.\nAnd so we decided that -- he pulled out. First thing I committed to do is rejoin that accord, number one.\nBut, number two, number two, what you have to do is, you look at it, there's multiple ways in which we can deal with climate.\nI'm going off to COP 26 in Scotland and -- in -- I don't know -- I guess it's two weeks or a week? I'm losing track of time.\nAnd I'm presenting a commitment to the world that we will, in fact, get to net zero emissions on electric power by 2035 and net zero emissions across the board by 2050 or before.\nBut we have to do so much between now and 2030 to demonstrate what we're going to -- that we're going to do. So, let me give you a couple of examples.\nNo, it hasn't.\nNo, it -- look...\nHe's opposed to it.\nBut here's the deal. That is only one of well over, well over a trillion dollars worth of expenditures for climate change. It's $150 billion. It's important. And what it says is that if, in fact, a utility doesn't pull back and continue to reduce the amount of carbon that they emit, that what will happen is, they will end up paying a penalty.\nAnd so there's a penalty incurred. Joe Manchin's argument is: Look, we still have coal in my state. You're going to eliminate it eventually. We know it's going away. We know it's going to be gone, but don't rush it so fast that my people don't have anything to do.\nI think that's not what we should be doing. But the fact of the matter is, we can take that $150 billion, add it to the $320 billion that's in the law now that he's prepared to support for tax incentives, tax incentives, to have people act in a way that they're going to be able to do the things that need to be do -- from -- for example, if you're -- if you have got windows that are -- the wind's blowing through, you get an incentive to put new windows in your home.\nYou get -- help get it paid. We're going to significantly reduce the amount, the cost of solar panels on your roof. We're going to continually -- and, for example, there's new battery technologies that are being -- I went out in Silicon Valley. There's a battery that's about that wide and about that thick. If you have solar power, you put that in your basement, and if the sun doesn't shine for seven days, you still have all the power you need.\nNothing has been formally agreed to. The concession has been -- the negotiation is I've been saying to Joe, look, I'll take -- if we don't do it in terms of the electric grid piece, what we'll do is give me that $150 billion. I'm going to add it to be able to do other things that allow me to do things that don't directly affect the electric grid in the way that there's a penalty but allow me to spend the money to set new technologies in place.\nFor example, we can save significant amounts of money and as a consequence of that significant amounts of energy if, in fact, we are able to put the high tension wires underground. It costs a hell of a lot more to do it. It creates real good jobs.\nIt creates a hell of a lot more to do it. But in fact, it would do a lot to keep things from happening that are dangerous. Half the forest fires out west are those towers coming down --\n-- setting fires, et cetera. So, there's a lot of things Joe is open to my convincing him that I can use it to increase environmental progress without it being that particular deal.\nYeah, so, first -- first of all, we've created more jobs in the first eight months of my administration than any president in American history. Total number of jobs created.\nBut the problem for the people not going back to work is twofold. Number one, they're reluctant to go back to work because they're afraid of COVID, many of them. So they don't want to go back and they don't want to be exposed to the customers because they're not required to wear masks, they're not required to have shots, or they don't want to go back because they're not sure the people waiting on them in the -- at the table or the people coming up in the food market.\nSo, a lot of it has to do with COVID, number one. Number two -- that's why, you know, we were able to go from when I first got elected, when I first was elected, there were only 2 million people had COVID shots in the United States of America, the vaccine. Now we've got 190 million because I went out and bought everything I could do and buy in sight (ph) and it worked.\nBut here's the deal. The second thing -- the second thing that's happened, Anderson, is that people are now using this as an opportunity to say, wait a minute, do I want to go back to that $7 an hour job?\nI won't name the particular restaurant chain. But they found out when they couldn't hire anybody, when they found out they started to pay 20 bucks an hour, everybody wanted to go back to work. Not a joke.\nSo what you see is wages were actually up for those who are working because for the first time in a long time, employees are able to bargain. You're the boss. You want me to work for you? What are you going to pay me? How are you going to do it? I'm not being facetious.\nThe third thing that's out there is there's a circumstance that exists where people are really worried about what they're going to do -- I mean, how can I say this? How many people do you know, and maybe some in this audience, who because of what you've been through, a loss of a husband, wife, brother, mother, father, son, whatever, or you've had something that's really impacted you with COVID, that you really find yourself just down? I mean, just down.\nAnd so, there's a lot of people who are just down. They're not sure how to get back in the game. They're not sure whether they want to get back in the game.\nThink of this. If you're graduating from Morgan State, okay?\nWell, guess what? You didn't have those great dances the last four years you had before you around -- no, I'm not joking. Graduating from high school, you don't have your prom. You don't have your graduation. You don't have the thing -- all the things that matter to people that go into things they look forward to.\nSo, a lot of it has to do with us getting back on our feet and getting back on our feet in terms of our attitudes about what the future looks like for us.\nWhat I say -- well, there are, and I tell you what, there's plenty of help.\nLook, being down, having some problem in terms of needing some advice, if you have a broken spirit, it's no different than a broken arm. You shouldn't be ashamed of it. You should seek the help.\nBut I really mean it.\nI don't -- I'm not saying that's the whole problem. What I'm saying, it is an element in terms of attitude about people, what they wanted.\nLook, how often I get asked the question, what's Christmas going to be like? How about Thanksgiving? Is it going to be okay? I mean, what's going to happen? I mean, will I be able to buy gifts for my kids?\nHow -- there's a lot of anxiety people have.\nHi, Anna.\nANNA HIRSCH, STUDENT, LOYOLA UNIVERSITY: President Biden, growing up in a small town, I've been surrounded by small business owners including my mom, who owns her own interior design business. With the current supply chain crisis, small businesses are in jeopardy of not being able to get products that they need because priority is given to large businesses. Does your administration have any policies or plans in place to aid the current supply chain problem and/or to help small businesses that are affected by this?\nYes on both. But you have it exactly right. We have a significant supply chain problem. In the Obama-Biden administration all American business -- it made sense, it was just on time. You wanted to make sure that you didn't waste any money and/or time between producing whatever you're producing and having it done. You didn't. So that's how you saved money. You didn't buy the material six months ahead of time and then keep it in your inventory and then -- it was on time. Now that's a big problem. You can't -- people can't do it. They want to get out ahead. What I've recently done, and people said -- or doubted we could get it done, I was able to go to the private portion -- 40 percent of all products coming into the United States of America on the West Coast go through Los Angeles and -- what am I doing here?\nLong Beach. Thank you. And I know both the mayors. So I went to them and I said, what can we do? So I met with -- and they're privately owned, these ports. These two. So I met with the business people. I met with all their major customers, the Walmarts of the world and all the rest. There are like 70 ships waiting out there unable to get unloaded. So I -- and because not always the longshoremen don't always get along with the business folks in there, I got -- I've a relationship with them, and I brought them together and I said, you've got to be open 24/7. No port there was open five days a week, 40 hours a week, 24/7. They've all agreed to it. They've agreed to it.\nYes. Absolutely. Positively. I will do that. But in addition to that, what you've got to do is you've got to get these ships in and unloaded. And one of the things in my infrastructure plan, there's $16 billion for port expansion. We have to be able to move things along. Because what's happening is a product your mother may need for interior design in terms of drapery or colors or something that is imported from somewhere else, well, guess what, a lot of these places, particularly in South Asia, are closing down because of COVID. The businesses are just flat closing.\nYes.\nYes. But here's -- and that's why what we're doing now...\nWell, I had a timetable to -- first of all, I want to get the ports up and running and get the railroads and the railheads and the trucks in port ready to move because I've gotten Walmart and others to say we're going to move stuff off of the port into our warehouses.\nThe answer is yes, if we can't move -- increase the number of truckers, which we're in the process of doing.\nIf we did it this moment, we're not -- but the whole point is we've got to get the small businesses as well because the big guys are in trouble. And a lot of the product that your mother makes, the product she -- the things she does in her interior design building, the material she buys from the larger outfits, I assume. I don't know that. I shouldn't -- but my whole point is small businesses need the help badly. Small businesses make up 60 percent of all the revenue coming from business out there.\nHey.\nWell, there's a number of things that have already been done. And it's hard -- and people don't think about it. The American Rescue Plan has provided for an awful lot. The $1.9 billion (ph) we passed right after I got elected. So what you've got is you've got that $1,400 check in the mail. You got a lot of things that helped ameliorate some of the concerns and costs because we knew what we were coming into. We knew we had inherited the wind and things were going to get worse before they got better.\nBut in terms of being able to have, what my dad used to say, a little breathing room, just a little -- my dad busted his neck. He didn't have a good-paying job. My dad was a well-read high school-educated guy who thought his greatest sin in the world was he didn't get to go to college.\nAnd but my dad was one of those guys that worked like hell, come home for dinner and then he'd go back and finish up work and close the shop. And the whole point of it was that all we want to give, all he'd talk about is, Joey, all I need is just a little breathing room, a little space. A little space. COOPER: Let me ask you about that with just in terms of inflation,\nbecause you had told us at a town hall, I think it was in July, that it's just near-term inflation. The Wall Street Journal recently talked to like 67 financial experts who said that they saw high inflation going all the way -- or deep into 2022. Do you think it's going to last for a while?\nI don't think so. I don't think it will last if -- depending on what we do. If we stay exactly where we are, yes. If we don't make these investments, yes.\nGas prices relate to a foreign policy initiative that is about something that goes beyond the cost of gas. And we're about $3.30 a gallon most places now when it's up from -- it was down in the single digits -- I mean single digits, a dollar-plus. And that's because of the supply being withheld by OPEC. And so there's a lot of negotiation that is -- there's a lot of Middle Eastern folks who want to talk to me. I'm not sure I'm going to talk to them. But the point is it's about gas production. There's things we can do the in meantime, though.\nMy guess is you'll start to see gas prices come down as we get by going into the winter -- I mean, excuse me, into next year, 2022. I don't see anything that's going to happen in the meantime that's going to significantly reduce gas prices.\nBut, for example, for natural gas to heat your homes as winter's coming, there's a lot of -- what people don't realize, we put in billions of dollars into what we call LIHEAP. LIHEAP is the provision whereby you're able to get funding from the federal government based upon your need to heat your home. And it's subsidized in a significant way. And there's billions of dollars we had passed in the legislation I got passed in March of this year. Because we anticipated that would be a problem as well.\nBut the answer ultimately is, ultimately meaning the next three or four years, is investing in renewable energy. What I was able to do...\nYou know, by the way, I really -- I'm not being -- I mean, I'm being literal when I say this. What I was able to do when I ran, and you remember, Anderson, because I was on your show a couple of times, and the issue was whether or not I could ever get the labor unions to support my environmental programs. And I went out and I went to the IBEW and as well to the autoworkers, and I laid out my plan. They fully embraced it. Why? Because -- and I spent time at General Motors and other companies. And I got General Motors -- I didn't get them. General Motors decided after a long time spent talking to me, they were suing California because they had a higher standard -- mileage standard. They dropped the suit and agreed that they would be 50 percent electric vehicles by 2030. By 2030.\nAnd now you have all three, all three major manufacturers saying the same thing. So what will happen is you're going to see a dramatic drop, a dramatic drop in what's going to happen in terms of gas prices as we go into the next two or three years, even if we're not able to break the monopoly price they're keeping it up because -- anyway. So there's -- but I don't -- I must tell you, I don't have a near-term answer. There's two things I could do. I could go in the petroleum reserve and take out and probably reduce the price of gas maybe 18 cents or so a gallon. It's still going to be above 3 bucks. And one of the things that I refuse to have happen, because I didn't want anybody -- I made a commitment if you pass the stuff I'm talking about, not one single penny in tax would go against anybody making less than 400 grand. And so if you notice, these highway bills are not paid for by gas tax. They're paid for by direct expenditures in other areas. So no average person is going to have to pay more.\nBut it's going to be hard. It's going to be hard. There's a possibility to be able to bring it down, depends on -- a little bit on Saudi Arabia and a few other things that are in the offing.\nI believe, and I want to make it clear, unlike past administrations, science will dictate this. I'm not telling anyone...\nNo, I really mean it.\nBut I do ask my COVID team what the expectations are. The expectations are it will be ready in the near term, meaning weeks, not months and months. OK? That's number one.\nNumber two, there are over 800,000 sites right now that exist in America where you can go get a vaccine. And you're going to be able to do that with your children. Particularly, we're going to try to work it out to deal with childcare centers, make it available there, as well as your pediatricians and the -- you know, and the docs, and finding places where you can do it -- some places are talking about doing it at, you know, in churches on the weekend and that kind of thing.\nSo there will be plenty of places to be able to get the vaccine when, if and when, it is approved. And it's likely to be approved. I've spent a lot of time with the team on these things. And it's likely to be approved. And whether it's Moderna or whether it's Pfizer or whether it's J&J, it's going to be approved and it will be in a much smaller dose, basically the same dose, but a smaller dose.\nAnd they're doing a lot of tests on it right now. And -- and those of you who have children or brothers or sisters who are between -- you know, who are in that age category above 12, get -- get the vaccine for them. Get the vaccine.\nGet it now.\nBy the way, there's two famous guys in this audience here I just noticed...\nYes and yes.\nBy the way...\nBy the way, I waited until July to talk about mandating, because I tried everything else possible.\nThe mandates are working. All this stuff about people leaving and people getting it, you have -- you have everyone from United Airlines to Spirit, all these airlines, \"We're not going to get\" -- all 96 percent, 97 percent of the people have gotten the vaccine. All the talk about all these folks who were going to leave the military if they're mandated, not true. You've got about a 90-some percent vaccination rate.\nI mean, so there's -- the idea is that -- look, the two things that concern me, one, are those who just try to make this a political issue -- freedom, \"I have the freedom to kill you with my COVID.\"\nNo, I mean, come on -- freedom -- number one.\nNumber two, the second one is that, you know, the gross misinformation that's out there -- like what they're saying about my buddy Colin Powell. And he was my friend, passed away. \"Colin Powell was vaccinated and he still died.\" Well, he knew he had serious underlying conditions and it would be difficult -- he clearly would have been gone earlier had he not gotten the vaccine, had he not gotten the -- the shots.\nBut my generic point is there's so much misinformation. You know what I find fascinating? I turn on Fox to find out how popular I am...\n... but...\nI'm doing very well.\nI think I'm at 3 percent favorable, but...\nBut all kidding aside, one of the things I find -- do you realize they mandate vaccinations?\nYes.\nI find that mildly fascinating.\nMildly fascinating.\nFirst of all, you have stated the proposition accurately, in my view.\nI did get overwhelming support from the African-American community. Only folks in Maryland understand Delaware has the eighth largest black population in America as a percent of population. It's been the source of my support. The only folks that helped me more than black men are black women.\nAnd I will tell you what my greatest regret is.\nMy greatest regret is, I have these -- had these three major pieces of legislation that are going to change the circumstances for working- class folks and African-Americans as well that I have been busting my neck trying to pass.\nBut what it's done is prevented me from getting deeply up to my ears, which I'm going to do once this is done, in dealing with police brutality, dealing with the whole notion of, what are we going to do about voting rights? It's the greatest assault on voting rights in the history of the United States, for real, since the Civil War.\nAnd, for example, when I was in the chair -- when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I thought I had done something really important.\nAnd I was able to get past and extended the Voting Rights Act for 25 years, and get everyone on that committee, including the Southern -- the senator from South Carolina and others, to vote for it. I thought we had moved.\nThe point I'm making is this. We're at a terrible place right now. And so, when this gets done -- and, in the meantime, here's what I have done. I have the authority to deal with federal law enforcement.\nSo, federal law enforcement, I have -- we have issued mandates, no choke holds, number one. Make sure that we're going to be able to do -- have no no-knock warrants, and a position where we're going to be able to see to it that we are able to go look at -- and we're doing it in four cities right now -- patterns of abuse and patterns of misconduct of police departments, making sure that we have access to police records in terms of what's happening in -- so, there's a lot I have been able to do by executive order, in essence.\nBy the way, I think they make a very good point.\nHere's the deal. If, in fact, I get myself into at this moment the debate on the filibuster, I lose at least three votes right now to get what I have to get done on the economic side of the equation, on the foreign policy side of the equation.\nSo, what I have said -- you're shaking your head no, but let me tell you something, Jack. It's the truth, number one.\nNumber two, number two, what I have proposed, in the meantime, is, it used to be, the filibuster, the way it worked -- and we have 10 times as many -- more than that -- times the filibuster has been used since 1978. It used to be, you had to stand on the floor and exhaust everything you had.\nAnd you went -- and when you gave up the floor, and someone else sought the floor, they had to talk until they finished. You're only allowed to do it a second time. After that, it's over. You vote. Somebody moved for the vote.\nI propose we bring that back now, immediately.\nBut I also think we're going to have to move to the point where we fundamentally alter the filibuster.\nThe idea that, for example, my Republican friends say that we're going to default on the national debt because they're going to filibuster that, and then we need 10 Republicans to support us, is the most bizarre thing I ever heard.\nI think you're going to see -- if that gets pulled again, I think you are going to see an awful lot of Democrats being ready to say, not me. I'm not doing that again. We're going to end the filibuster.\nBut it still is difficult to end the filibuster beyond that. That's another issue.\nI am open to fundamentally altering it.\nWell, that remains to be seen exactly what that means, in terms of fundamentally altering it, and whether or not we just end the filibuster straight up.\nThere are certain things that are just sacred rights. One is a sacred obligation that we never are going to renege on a debt. We're the only nation in the world we have never, ever reneged on a single debt.\nVoting rights is equally as consequential.\nAnd maybe more.\nNo, the way I said it was not appropriate.\nI said -- they asked me, would I -- do I think that he -- they should be prosecuted for denying the -- for not showing up at the committee? And I said yes.\nNow, that -- when I made a commitment, the -- one of the things I was committed to do when I ran was reestablish the reputation and integrity of the Justice Department. It has become the most -- it was corrupted under the last administration. I should have chosen my words more wisely. I did not, have not and\nwill not pick up the phone and call the attorney general and tell him what he should or should not do in terms of who he should prosecute.\nBut I answered the question honestly.\nAnd I think that anyone who does not respond to that kind of question from the -- from the -- a legitimate committee in the House of Representatives or the United States Senate should be held accountable.\nSo, that's as much as I can say without coming and looking like I'm telling the -- I have yet to talk to the attorney general about anything...\nAnd they will.\nI guarantee that.\nWell, again, I'm leaving that to them to tell me what -- and I didn't -- it's not a blanket, I will not release the information.\nIt's, I'm asking them to take a look at what is legitimate, what would be -- legitimately fall in the position that future presidents' authority would be compromised by that, and what is -- I don't think there's much legitimacy in the claim. So, that's being looked at right now.\nWell, those are legitimate questions.\nNumber one, the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which I oppose, the court said I had to maintain it. So we're repealing it. That's one of the reasons why we haven't changed it.\nWe have made a gigantic change. There were over 5,000 children, children, in the -- in the custody of the Border Patrol. They're now 504. We are making more progress than you think.\nAnd we have a circumstance where one of the things that is going to bear fruit, I believe, is I put together a program when I was a senator and the vice president helping -- help initiate it now where we provide for funding to change the circumstances on the ground in the countries in Central America.\nFor example, you're in a circumstance where, you know, people don't just sit around their hanyun (ph) table and say I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to coyote, let them -- take us across the border, drop us in a desert, place they don't want us, won't that be fun?\nPeople do it because they're desperate. They're desperate. And what I've been trying to do and I'm trying to do in this legislation as well is get funding so we have funding for immigration officers to be able to hear cases immediately of whether or not they justify having asylum granted to them.\nWe don't have that.\nYes.\nYes and that is -- we maintained that because of the extent of the -- of the continued extent of COVID in those countries from which people are coming. It's very, very high.\nAnd so, we maintained the policy. We're not sending back children. We send back adults and we send back large families. But we don't send back children in that circumstance.\nAnd so, that's why I have a proposal to provide for over a billion doses of COVID vaccine to the rest of the world, including a significant portion to Latin and Central America.\nI've been there before and I haven't -- I mean, I know it well. I guess I should go down. But the whole point of it is I haven't had a whole hell of a lot of time to get down. I've been spending time going around looking at the $900 billion worth of damage done by -- by hurricanes and floods and weather and traveling around the world.\nBut, I plan on -- now, my wife Jill has been down. She's been on both sides of the river. She's seen the circumstances there. She's looked into those places.\nYou notice you're not seeing a lot of pictures of kids lying on top of one another with, you know, with -- you know, looks like tarps on top of them. We've been able to deal with that. We've been able to significantly increase funding through the HHS, Health and Human Services, to provide shelter for these kids and people.\nBut, there's much more to be done. And -- and I realize -- I think it is -- it's a thing that concerns me the most about being able to get control of it, because I got to, number one, get enough funding to provide for immediate determination of whether or not someone that is, in fact, legitimately claiming a right to stay in the country because of legitimate fears, and purely for economic reasons to get in line but not get in the country.\nSo what we're doing is bringing a lot of folks who are coming in and they're doing ankle bracelets instead of people being sent back depending on whether or not their claim appears to be legitimate.\nWell, it depends what they mean by that. Look, I -- I grew up in a neighborhood --\nWell, could. I think you need police officers. I think we need police officers to protect us. I think they have to be under certain changed (ph) circumstances, but I think we have to provide for them more opportunities -- I call for more money for police to go to community policing as well as dealing with additional help for psychologists and others working with the police departments.\nNo, I haven't. I never supported it. But I've been a fan --\n-- of controlling police and making sure they're held accountable. They're two different issues.\nAnd one of the things -- look, when we had community policing initially in the late '90s, violent crimes dropped significantly, significantly. And the reason it did is because we had significant number of police.\nWhat I did, I eliminated the LEA Act funding, Law Enforcement Assistance Act, and I put in place the proposal that required community policing. What that meant was if your -- it's going to take a second but it's important.\nIf you -- what that meant if your city had authorized police force of 100 people, you could not take the money for community policing and fire 50 people and rehire 50 so now just have the federal government paying for half and you didn't increase the number of police. You had to increase the number of police beyond your -- whatever.\nSo I remember my son Beau was a chief law enforcement officer of the state of Delaware as attorney general of the state of Delaware. And he used to do what I did. He'd go down the east side, where you can find the best basketball in the country (ph) -- in the city, you know, every town has those -- those places. And he'd sit there on the bench with my son, my grandson Hunter, who is now 16, who was then 5, sit on the bench and he'd get to know these guys.\nAnd he'd walk over and he'd knock on the window of a police car that was sitting there, the cop not getting out of the car and say, get the hell out of the car and meet these folks.\nI'm sorry (ph). That's easy ones.\nWell, I think that's up to the locality to decide what they want to do on that. Look, there's -- there's a lot of -- there's a lot of people who have no social redeeming value, historically.\nAnd then there's others who have made serious mistakes in terms of what exists now in terms of what we should be talking about, but have done an awful lot. And so the very thing, for example, I just spoke at the Martin Luther King dedication and I pointed out that we're right across from the Lincoln Memorial. Well, you know, and you talked about -- and then the Jefferson Memorial.\nAnd what are we doing? I talked about how they said we're unique in all the world as a nation. We're the only nation founded on an idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal, endowed by -- no nation has ever been founded on an idea. Have we ever lived up to it? No. But it's a pretty big idea that somebody wrote that down and got the rest of the country to agree to it. So it depends. It depends and it's...\nWhere in Connecticut are you from?\nGLENN NIBLO, STUDENT, LOYOLA UNIVERSITY: Greenwich.\nGreenwich.\nYes. Yes, we have a commitment to do that.\nHe had enormous integrity. They knew that. But he's one of the few serious, serious players I've dealt with over these years. When he made a mistake, he acknowledges it. He said, I acknowledge -- I was wrong about that.\nOh, it's rare -- it has been rare -- it's rare in human nature for someone in a powerful position to say they are wrong. They are wrong. I made a mistake. That's a hard thing to do. And I've had to do it about a half a dozen times lately.\nBut all kidding aside, and the second thing about him was, he had a lot of serious -- he had real compassion. You know, his -- well, I'll tell you afterwards. But because we only have a few minutes. He and I went out the the Secret Service racetrack. He had a brand new Corvette, his family bought him, his kids bought him, and I have a '67 327 350, and we raced. We raced.\nAnd, you know, the only reason -- no, I'm serious. It was on Jay Leno. Check it out. Jay Leno. He is a hell of a guy.\nWell, I won only because he was worried I was going to crash into him.\nBecause I don't have Positraction. So I was burning rubber the whole way out there. And I could see him going, whoa.\nSixty seconds. We got in the car to go over to the Department of Education after we did that.\nNo, no. He got in the car and he was laughing like hell. I said, what's so damn funny. And he told me. I whispered in his ear this way. I looked to see where he was. And I'm going, and this is a big deal. And I didn't realize the guy behind me was lip reading. He could see it.\nNo, I'm serious. The answer is, yes, this is bigger. No, it is bigger because -- not because what he did wasn't enormous, he broke the ice, enormous. But part of what I have in here is we also increased access to the Affordable Care Act and we reduced the price an average of 60 bucks a month for anyone who is in the Affordable Care Act. Plus on top of that we have another $300 billion worth of health care in it. So it's -- I would say this is a bigger darn deal.\nIs it all right if I introduce you to (INAUDIBLE)?", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-anderson-cooper-cnn-baltimore-maryland"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Rome, Italy", "Date": "2021-10-31", "Text": "Please, sit down. I apologize for keeping you waiting. We were playing with elevators. [Laughter] Long story.\nAt any rate, good evening. I believe we've had a series of very productive meetings in the past few days, and I'm looking forward to continuing to make progress on critical global issues that we—as we head off to Glasgow.\nBecause of what we've seen again here in Rome, what I think is the power of America showing up and working with our allies and partners to make progress on issues that matter to all of us. And there's really no substitute for face-to-face discussions and negotiations among the leaders when it comes to building understanding and cooperation.\nI found in all of my meetings here, both the larger sessions and the one-on-one sessions—and I had many of those—a real eagerness among our partners and allies for American leadership to help bring the world together and solve some of these big problems.\nI found my one-on-one engagements with so many of the leaders, and the importance of strong, personal relationships never feels the same—it never ceases to amaze me when it's—you're looking at someone straight in the eye when you're trying to get something done. They know me; I know them. We can get things done together.\nAnd so I want to thank the Italian people, by the way, for the G-20, for their hospitality, and congratulate Prime Minister Draghi. He did one heck of a job leading the G-20 through a difficult year marked by great global challenges, critically among them: ending the pandemic; driving a broad-based, sustainable global economic recovery; and tackling the climate crisis. I believe we made tangible progress on each of these issues, in part because of the commitment that the United States has brought to the table.\nFor example, I'm proud that the G-20 endorsed the global minimum tax. This is something the United States has been driving for over a year, building momentum up to this achievement. And this is an incredible win for all our countries.\nInstead of nations competing against one another to attract investments by bottoming out corporate tax rates, this set a minimum floor of 15 percent to ensure that giant corporations begin to pay their fair share, no matter where they're headquartered, instead of hiding profits overseas.\nWe also agreed to establish a fund in the future that—for—countries can draw on to help prevent, if necessary, and respond to the next pandemic, prepared for the next time around.\nYesterday, together with Prime Minister Johnson and Merkel and Macron—President Macron, we came together to reiterate our shared belief that diplomacy—diplomacy—is the best way to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon, and we discussed how best to encourage Iran to resume serious, good-faith negotiations.\nI also wanted to note that, even as I've been here in Rome, as you might guess—and some of you, I suspect, do the same thing, American reporters—I've been focused on the vital issues that affect American workers and families at home.\nI just finished meeting with a broad coalition of partners on how to address the immediate supply chain backlogs and dealing that—that the world has been dealing with and facing, and we're facing back at home, and how to make sure we have access to all the products we need—from shoes, to furniture, to electronics, to automobiles—to make sure that we talk about how better to secure ourselves against these future shocks, whether a pandemic, climate change, or other disasters.\nAnd the Build Back Better framework—which is, God willing, going to be voted on as early as—sometime this coming week—that I announced on Thursday includes, for the first time ever, several billion dollars to help strengthen the supply chains to make sure we have access to everything we need.\nAnd it's going to give workers and folks making all these products just a little bit of breathing room. The Build Back Better will also—is going to make it easier for them to afford everything from childcare while they are at work, for their kids; 2 years of free high-quality preschool.\nAnd finally, today I was proud to announce, together with our close partners—EU partners, another critical win for both American workers and the climate agenda. The United States and the European Union have agreed to negotiate the world's first trade agreement based on how much carbon is in a product, as we negotiated the steel and aluminum tariffs that were in place.\nWe made agreement and, I might add, strong support of the U.S. steelworkers back home. And I want to thank them. I want to thank Tom Conway, who I spoke to today, president of the United Steelworkers, for his partnership in arriving at this deal.\nThe deal will immediately remove a point of significant tension with our friends in the European Union. And it rejects the false idea that we cannot grow an economy and support American workers while tackling the climate crisis at the same time.\nWe're talking about a lot—a lot—during the G-20, the COP26. But we also know tackling the climate crisis has been an all-hands-on-deck effort. American workers are a critical part of the solution.\nAnd now I'm happy to take some questions. And I'm told I should start with AP, Zeke Miller. Zeke, you have a question?\nI didn't recognize you with the mask on. I apologize.\nBecause of the way they reacted. You were here. They listened. Everyone sought me out. They wanted to know what our views were. And we helped lead what happened here.\nIt's just very simple: You know, if you're honest—you are honest; I didn't mean to imply you weren't—but that we were—we got significant support here. Significant support. We're the most—the United States of America is the most critical part of this entire agenda, and we did it.\nAnd by the way, look, the polls are going to up and down and up and down. They were high early, then they got medium, then they went back up, and now they're low.\nWell, look, this is—look at every other President; the same thing has happened. But that's not why I ran. I didn't run to determine how well I'm going to do in the polls. I ran to make sure that I followed through on what I said I would do as President of the United States.\nAnd I said that I would make sure that we were in a position where we dealt with climate change; where we moved in a direction that would significantly improve the prospects of American workers being able to have good jobs and good pay; and further, that I would make sure that we dealt with the crisis that was caused by COVID. We've done all of those; we continue to do them. And we'll see what happens.\nBut I'm not running because of the polls.\nNext question was from Jeff Mason—for Jeff Mason of Reuters.\nI'll answer both questions.\nNumber one, I believe we will pass my Build Back Better plan, and I believe we will pass the infrastructure bill. Combined, they have $900 billion in climate resistance—in dealing with climate and resilience. And it's the largest investment in the history of the world that's ever occurred, and it's going to pass, in my view. But we'll see. We'll see.\nYou know, you've all believed it wouldn't happen from the very beginning, the moment I announced it, and you always seem amazed when it's alive again. Well, you may turn out to be right; maybe it won't work. But I believe we'll see by the end of next week, at home, that it's passed.\nWith regard to the—and by the way, that infrastructure bill delivers an awful lot of things in terms of everything from tax credits for electric vehicles, to making sure we are able to invest, literally, billions of dollars in everything from highways, roads, bridges, public transit, airports, et cetera. But we'll see.\nThe—and with regard to the disappointment: The disappointment relates to the fact that Russia and—and including not only Russia, but China, basically didn't show up in terms of any commitments to deal with climate change. And there's a reason why people should be disappointed in that. I found it disappointing myself.\nBut what we did do—we passed a number of things here to end the subsidization of coal. We made commitments here from across the board, all of us, in terms of what we're going to bring to the G26 [COP26].*\nAnd, I think, you know, as that old bad—that old trite saying goes, \"The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.\" I think you're going to see we've made significant progress, and more has to be done. But it's going to require us to continue to focus on what China is not doing, what Russia is not doing, and what Saudi Arabia is not doing.\nWell, on the surface, it seems like an irony, but the truth of the matter is—you've all known; everyone knows—that the idea we're going to be able to move to renewable energy overnight and not have—from this moment on, not use oil or not use gas or not use hydrogen is just not rational.\nCertain things we can wipe out and we don't have to do. We should be moving immediately to get rid of—as they've adopted here my proposal—to end methane, to deal with a whole range of things.\nBut it does, on the surface, seem inconsistent, but it's not at all inconsistent in that no one has anticipated that this year we'd be in a position—or even next year—that we're not going to use any more oil or gas; that we're not going to be engaged in any fossil fuels. We're going to stop subsidizing those fossil fuels. We're going to be making significant changes.\nAnd it just makes the argument that we should move more rapidly to renewable energy: to wind and solar and other means of energy.\nBut the idea that we're just going to end and somehow—but it does, on the surface, I admit to you. We're going to COP to deal with renewable energy, and I'm saying, \"Why are you guys cutting off oil and raising the price just to make it look harder for us?\" But it's a legitimate question.\nI think, though, that if anybody thinks about it, no one ever thought that tomorrow—for example, it's going to take us between now and 2030 to have half the vehicles in America electric vehicles. So the idea we're not going to need gasoline for automobiles is just not realistic. But we will get to the point that, by 2050, we have zero emissions.\nJim? Jim Tankersley, New York Times.\nWell, because they have to get to their work. They have to get in an automobile, turn on the key, get their kids to school. The school buses have to run. That's the reason why. You know that, Jim. That's the reason.\nThe idea that we can—that there's an alternative to walk away from being able to get in your automobile is just not realistic; it's not going to happen. And this wasn't intended to happen.\nAnd by the way, when the cost of a gallon of gasoline gets to above three hundred and thirty—three hundred—$3.35 a gallon, it has profound impact on working class families just to get back and forth to work. So I don't see anything inconsistent with that.\nBut I do think that the idea that Russia and Saudi Arabia and other major producers are not going to pump more oil so people can have gasoline to get to and from work, for example, is—is not right. But—and what we're considering doing on that, I'm reluctant to say before I have to do it.\nLabor Issues/U.S. Economy/Global Supply Chain Disruptions\nBecause they're able to negotiate for higher wages, and they move from one job to another. That's one of the reasons why. A lot of people don't want to continue to do the job they did before, making 7, 8, 9 bucks an hour. An awful lot of the auto—excuse me, of the truck drivers are not unionized truck drivers. They're working like hell and not getting paid a whole lot.\nAnd so what you're seeing here is a combination of the desire of people to be able to change professions, to be able to do more and take care of their families, and at the same time, dealing with the issue that, in fact, we are short of workers.\nBut worker pay has actually gone up. And we've employed 6 million people just since I got elected. So employment is up. The economy is actually, in spite of all this, still growing. You have the significant number of—I forget the number; I think it was close to six—16 major economists acknowledging that what's going to happen is, you're going to see continued economic growth under our proposals. You had a total of 14—I think it was 14—Nobel laureate economists in economics saying this is going to—what I'm proposing is going to reduce the inflation, et cetera.\nSo there's a lot going on. This is—look, we really are—I know you're tired of hearing me say this—we really are at one of inflection points in history. So much is changing. So many pieces on the table are moving. And how they get resettled depends upon the judgments we make and whether or not the United States, among others, can lead the world in a direction that's going to increase the circumstances for a higher standard of living for workers here and abroad, as well as making sure that people have an opportunity. As I said—again, I use the phrase—\"just have a little breathing room.\"\nI meant what I said when I ran. My desire was to build this economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. And that's what's in process of happening.\nBut in the meantime, there's been enormous changes as a consequence of COVID on the supply chains, because why are we having trouble? An awful lot of the very factories and—and operations that, in fact, produced material that we need for supply chains, in everything from shoes to dealing with computer chips, you know, they're out sick; they're not working.\nAnd so it's changing. The economy is changing, and the United States has to stay ahead of the curve. That's why I introduced the infrastructure bill. That's why I also introduced the Build Back Better initiative.\nThe Washington Post, Seung Min Kim. Where are—there you are. I'm sorry. I couldn't see you.\nWell, in a sense, they're two different issues. One is whether or not we get to the JCPOA—we rejoin that. And that depends—that's why I had the meetings with my colleagues here in Rome, who are part of the original group of six people—six nations that got together to say that we should negotiate a change, which I found that I think we're continuing to suffer from the very bad judgments that President Trump made in pulling out of the JCPOA.\nAnd so that's one issue. And that issue is going to depend on whether—and how that gets resolved is going to depend on their action and the willingness of our friends, who are part of the original agreement, to stick with us and make sure there's a price to pay economically for them if they fail to come back.\nWith regard to the issue of how we're going to respond to actions taken by them against the interests of the United States—whether they're drone strikes or anything else—is we're going to respond, and we're going to continue to respond.\nABC, Cecilia Vega.\nIt's hard to see you guys with a mask on. I apologize.\nYes, I can. Because what we're proposing and what we've initiated is everything from getting the automobile makers to commit to going all electric, number one. Getting the unions to agree to do that as well. Making sure we have the investment in battery technology that requires us to have the ability to generate electric vehicles, electric buses, electric transportation grids. Making sure that we are dealing with everything from—let me go through some of these: that we have tax credits for—of $320 billion for dealing with alternatives by people getting a tax credit for moving on solar panels, on wind, and a whole range of other things, and winterizing their properties.\nI don't think you're going to need any punitive action to get people to step up and do those things. There's been no indication that's the case at all. With regard to, you know, the—there's a total of $555 billion in climate and—I'm just checking the numbers; make sure I'm right—and climate investment, in terms of resilience.\nWe're now—it's very much in the interest of—of the industry to see to it that we move to making sure that we have the resilience to be able to, when those towers come down and the lines end up hitting the ground and burning down large swaths of the West, to bury this underground.\nThere's a whole range of things. I don't think we're going to have to—everybody knows which direction it's going. And there's no indication that there has to be a punitive effort to get people to react the way in which we have to do, at least I don't believe so.\nLook, I'm not going to—a lot of this is just personal. Pope Francis has become a—I don't want to exaggerate—has become a—someone who has provided great solace for my family when my son died.\nHe has—he is, in my view—there's always been this debate in the Catholic Church, going back to Pope John XXIII, that talk about how we reach out and embrace people with differences.\nIf you notice what the Pope said when he was asked when he first got elected Pope—he was traveling with the press, and they said, \"What's your position on homosexuals?\" He said, \"Who am I to judge?\"\nThis is a man who is of great empathy. He is a man who understands that part of his Christianity is to reach out and to forgive. And so I just find my relationship with him one that I personally take great solace in. He is a really, truly genuine, decent man.\nAnd I'll end by saying that, you know, there were an awful lot of people who—and many of you—I'm not putting you in this position; I apologize—but many of you who are even in the press who went out of your way to express your empathy and sympathy when I lost the real part of my soul, when I—when my—when I lost my Beau, my son.\nAnd I—my family will never forget—my extended family. Because when I had come—it was only a matter of days since my son had passed away, and Pope Francis came to the United States to visit with the—with not only President Obama, but with the Catholic Church here. And I was asked if I would accompany him to Philadelphia, to the seminary, and—anyway.\nAnd I did, but it was—the wounds were still raw of the loss of my son. And I had my extended family—and you're all tired of seeing my extended family; they're always around—my grandchildren, my children, my wife, my daughters-in-law.\nAnd before he left and got on the plane, the Pope asked whether or not he could meet with my family. And we met in a hangar in—at the Philadelphia Airport. And he came in, and he talked to my family for a considerable amount of time—10, 15 minutes—about my son Beau.\nAnd he didn't just generically talk about him; he knew about him. He knew what he did. He knew who he was. He knew where he went to school. He knew what he knew what a man he was. And it had such a cathartic impact on his children and my wife and our family that it—it meant a great deal.\nAnd as—I meant what I said—everybody was laughing; I didn't realize you all were able to film what I was doing with the Pope when I gave him a command coin. And I meant what I said: I—this is a man who is someone who is looking to establish peace and decency and honor, not just in the Catholic Church, but just generically.\nWhen I won, he called me to tell me how much he appreciated the fact that I would focus on the poor and focus on the needs of people who were in trouble. And so I just—again, I don't want to talk more about it, because so much of it is personal, but I'm—he is everything I learned about Catholicism from the time I was a kid going from grade school through high school.\nAnd I have great respect for people who have other religious views, but he is—he's just a fine, decent, honorable man. And I—he—and we keep in touch.\nI thank you all very, very much for your patience. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-rome-italy-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Date": "2021-11-02", "Text": "Good evening, everyone.\nWell, we're preparing to wrap up another busy day in Scotland. I think we got a lot done. We've had a lot of good, substantive meetings, and—with my fellow leaders. And most of all, it was critically important for the United States to be here at COP26, back in the Paris Agreement, raising domestic climate ambitions and demonstrating a commitment to support the rest of the world, particularly those countries that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis.\nToday—today—I spoke to leaders of forested nations, island nations, developing countries. And my message to them was: The United States is going to be their partner as we meet this climate crisis.\nAnd I want to thank the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Johnson for hosting us—hosting the world at a critical moment, as well as—I met with Prince Charles, who's put together a very significant operation over the last 6, 7 years of trying to bring in the private sector into—to work on a number of these issues.\nGlasgow must start—be the start, as I—you're tired of hearing me say it—but a decisive decade of action so we can keep a limit of 1.5 degrees within the reach of us and the rest of the world. And we have to keep accelerating our progress. Today's agreement by more than 100 countries, representing 85 percent of the world's forests, to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 is a great example—a great example—of the kind of ambition we need. And the United States is proud—proud—to have initiated and supported it.\nFor our part, the United States is going to keep raising the ambition and delivering the goal that we are reducing U.S. emissions by 50 to 52 percent, as Secretary Kerry has talked about, from the 2005 levels by 2030. This decade, we have to make significant progress.\nAnd by the way, I might note parenthetically: I can't think of any 2 days where more has been accomplished dealing with climate than these 2 days. Overall, in the past 2 days, I've announced a series of initiatives that are going to make sure we hit the target of including, today, two new rules to reduce methane losses of new and existing oil and gas operations and from natural gas pipelines.\nThanks to the effort of—our joint effort with the EU, we've grown the Global Methane Pledge—you remember, I raised it when I spoke to the United Nations—from 9 countries signing on to that pledge in September at the United Nations to more than 100 countries have signed on. It's about half the world's methane emissions, 70 percent of the world's global GDP.\nWe've made commitments to promote climate-smart agriculture, spur innovation, catalyze private finance to clean—for a clean economy, and to drive high-standard, clean climate-resilient infrastructure through the Build Back Better initiative.\nWe had a great meeting today, where we sat and talked about the whole focus of my Build Back Better initiative, which is adopted by the G-7—was that everything should be focused on—as we help with the infrastructure of the rest of the world, which needs it badly—focused on climate. Climate.\nThe example is: If you build an oil well, if you—excuse me—if you build a gas or oil refinery, you're going to have that for next 30 years. Well, why not invest now if we're going provide for the help for nations in solar capacity or wind capacity?\nSo, the point is, although the—we also brought through the—the new President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience. We called it—I'm getting tired of acronyms, I have to admit to you, but it's called \"PREPARE.\" We're going to support climate adaptation efforts to more than a half a billion people worldwide. We also released our overall long-term strategy that outlines how we'll get to net-zero emissions by 2050.\nYou know, we know that this is—this must be a whole-of-society effort. And I also want to thank the representatives from the private sector and from labor and philanthropies, civil societies, who are dedicating themselves to the climate action efforts we're all making here. That leadership—together with action by State and local and Tribal governments—has been essential in the United States.\nThat's why, despite the previous administration's pulling us out of the Paris Agreement and refusing even to acknowledge there was a climate crisis, we still brought down emissions during that period.\nI also want to acknowledge the passion and power of the young people and the activists who are doing such vital work to remind us of our moral obligation to future generations.\nBut look, as I said yesterday, it's not just a moral imperative, it's an economic imperative as well. Investing in our clean energy future is an enormous opportunity—enormous opportunity—for every country to create good-paying jobs and spur a broad-based economic recovery.\nAs I've said—you've heard me say it before to my colleagues as well: When I think of climate crisis, I think of jobs. And that's what the Build Back Better framework will do for the American people.\nIt's going to bring historic investment in clean energy addressing the climate crisis. It's going to cut greenhouse gas emissions by well over a gigaton by 2030.\nIt's going to save consumers money in their energy bills and—with tax credits for things like installing solar panels and weatherization of their homes.\nIt's also going to provide manufacturing credits to make sure the United States is competing in energy markets of the future, like solar panels and wind turbines.\nAnd it's also going to accelerate electric vehicles and electric school buses and build a nationwide network of 500,000 charging stations to power them.\nIt's about jobs. It's about competitiveness versus complacency. It's about making the world safer, cleaner, healthier—a place for our children, and children all around the world, to look to the future in a way that they can't now.\nI—and so there's so many other things that have happened today that I feel good about.\nBut let me start, if you will, by—I'll be happy to take your questions.\nPhil [Phil Mattingly, CNN], you've got a question? I watch you on TV a lot. [Laughter]\nWell, let me start off by addressing the first part of—if not the question, the statement. And that is that I indicated that China and Russia not showing up—and Saudi Arabia—was a problem. We showed up. We showed up. And by showing up, we've had a profound impact on the way I think the rest of the world is looking at the United States and its leadership role.\nI think it's been a big mistake, quite frankly, for China—with respect to China not showing up. The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, \"What value added are they providing?\" And they've lost an ability to influence people around the world and all the people here at COP—the same way, I would argue, with regard to Russia.\nWith regard to the more profound question about do I—am I worried about an armed conflict or some—that accidentally occurring with China: No, I'm not. But I have had, as I've said before—and I think we've talked about this, Phil, but I may be mistaken—that I think, as I've said, I look at China—and I've had hours of conversations with Xi Jinping, both in person when I was Vice President and since I've been President, at least 5 or 6 hours' worth of conversations on the telephone, and I'm going to be having a virtual summit with him—I've made it clear: This does—this is competition; it does not have to be conflict. There is no reason there needs to be conflict.\nBut I've also indicated to him, and I've—so I don't—I'm not reluctant to say it publicly—that we expect him to play by the rules of the road. We're not going to change our attitude toward what constitutes international airspace, international sea lanes, et cetera.\nWe also have made it clear that we have to work on dealing with things like cybersecurity and a whole range of other issues. But I'm not looking for, I don't anticipate there will be a need for—to be—there be physical conflict. But you know, as you've heard me say this before—my dad had an expression. He'd say, \"The only conflict worse than the one that's intended is one that's unintended\"—one that's unintended.\nAnd so, in my meetings with him virtually coming up—we haven't set the exact date yet—I want to make sure there's no misunderstanding. It's competition, not conflict. And so there's no—no unintended.\nYes, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].\nThe President's Economic Agenda/Senator Joseph A. Manchin III\nNumber one, I'm not going to talk about the specifics of my conversations. He will vote for this if we have in this proposal what he has anticipated, and that is looking at the fine print and the detail of what comes out of the House in terms of the actual legislative initiatives. I believe that Joe will be there.\nWith regard to the issue of whether or not he thinks that he's worried about this being inflationary or going to be a negative impact on the economy, I think that I've made it clear to Joe and will continue to—we will—that—I apologize to repeat it, Peter, but 17 Nobel laureates in economics said it's going to lower inflation, raise wages, increase competition, create 2 million jobs a year, et cetera.\nAnd so I think that—I understand that Joe is looking for the precise detail to make sure nothing got slipped in, in terms of the way in which the legislation got written, that is different than he acknowledged he would agree to.\nBut I think we'll get this done.\nInflation/Gasoline Prices/U.S. Economy\nWell, look, first of all, the significant reason why prices are up is because of COVID affecting the supply chain. I mean, I know you—I'm not trying to be instructive; I know you know this. Number one.\nNumber two, if you take a look at, you know, gas prices and you take a look at oil prices, that is a consequence of, thus far, the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil. And we'll see what happens on that score sooner than later.\nNumber three, I think if you take a look at what we're talking about—you look to this coming Thanksgiving—you know, we're in a situation where we find that we are in a very different circumstance.\nLast Thanksgiving, you know, I—as I said, this year, we're working on the supply chain issue. But last Thanksgiving, I sat down with my wife, my daughter, and my son-in-law. This Thanksgiving, we're all in a very different circumstance. Things are a hell of a lot better, and the wages have gone up higher—faster than inflation. And we have generated real economic growth.\nIt doesn't mean these dislocations aren't real. They do affect people's lives. For example, one of the reasons why I decided to talk about the need to deal with the operation and the gouging that occurs in some of the pricing of beef and chicken and other things is that that's why I think we're-—that's why I indicated to you we're going to look at whether or not there's a violation of antitrust laws and what they're doing.\nSo there's a lot to look at. But the bottom line is that I think that—and anyone who would prefer, as bad as things are in terms of prices helping—hurting families now, trade this Thanksgiving for last Thanksgiving.\nJen Epstein, Wall Street Journal.\nI mean—excuse me. I beg your pardon.\nI've got it. I've got it.\nAnd especially since my granddaughter works for you guys, in a different circumstance. So I've got it. I'm in trouble.\nNo, no, and no. No, I'm not going to discuss it with you, because that's in train now. We'll be making those announcements fairly quickly. It's been in train for some time, number one.\nNumber two, I also would indicate that I think we're going to have plenty of time to make sure all the major nominees are able to be cleared in time that—where their terms would expire.\nAnd number three, I've given a lot of thought to it, and I've been meeting with my economic advisers on what the best choices are, and we've got a lot of good choices. But I'm not going to speculate now.\nNancy [Nancy Cordes, CBS News], CBS. I think you had your hand up. I'm sorry. Did you?\nBecause we want to be able to breathe and we want to be able to lead the world. Look, I mean it sincerely: I think—presumptuous of me to say, to talk for another leader—but the fact that China, trying to assert, understandably, a new role in the world as a world leader—not showing up? Come on.\nThe single most important thing that's gotten the attention of the world is climate. Everywhere from Iceland, to Australia, to—you know, I mean, it just is a gigantic issue. And they've walked away. How do you do that and then claim to be able to have any leadership now?\nThe same with Putin and Russia. You know, his tundra is burning. He's in a—literally, the tundra is burning. He has serious, serious climate problems. And he is mum on the willingness to do anything.\nAnd so I genuinely believe—and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: When I said at COP7—excuse me, at the G-7 that America was back, you know, people wondered whether, \"Well, is that really true?\" Well, we're able to change the dynamic of a lot of things coming out of the G-7.\nI think—I've—this is going to—what I'm about to say sounds awfully self-serving: Two world leaders came up to me today and said: \"Thank you for your leadership. You're making a big difference here. You're moving people.\" I think you and I talked about that, John, with one of the folks talking to us.\nAnd so I think the fact that America showed up—America showed up—and decided to lead and lay out clearly what it wished to do. For example, you know, as I said, the mere fact that we were able to, you know, go from 7 or 8 people—or countries talking about—or maybe it was as high as 14; I don't remember the original number—to deal with the whole notion of methane. You know, now a hundred nations have signed on—a hundred nations. A hundred nations have signed on to reduce methane by 30 percent by 3030 [2030].* That is—and methane is 25 times more toxic to the environment than CO2. So we're making real progress.\nOr the deforestation issue, look what we're doing. Look we've been able to put together.\nAnd in addition to that, one of the things that I feel the best about—and I don't claim, uniquely—any unique credit for it—but I think that we've gotten, for the first time, a combination of—in dealing with an international problem and a—of that circumstances affect all nations—that we've not only gotten countries off the sideline, in terms of making significant financial contributions, but literally—literally—trillions of dollars' worth of the private sector jumping in, knowing they've got to play and they're going to play an incredibly positive part in dealing with these problems. It's real. It's genuine.\nAnd so I just think that—you know that old bad expression: \"The proof of the pudding is in the eating.\" You know, I feel confident we're going to get done what we have to done—do at home in order to deliver.\nAnd lastly, you know, if you take a look at what—what economy is growing? The United States. It's growing. It has problems, mainly because of COVID and the supply chain, but it's growing. We've created over 6 million jobs. We're leading the world in terms of the fastest growing economy—major economies.\nSo, I think, you know, we're going through a difficult time in the world because of COVID, because of supply chain consequences, because of the environment and all that's occurred, the way it's, in fact, imploded in the near term.\nBut I—as I said to you earlier, and I really mean it: I think it presents a gigantic opportunity—an opportunity to, in a sense, press the restart button and move in a direction that I think the vast majority of countries and—look, I'm sure you—you interview other world leaders that are here. The vast majority think this is an opportunity. They're not quite sure exactly what to do or exactly how to do it—not that I have all the answers; I'm not implying that—but they know that—they know that growth rests in dealing with the economy in a way that affects the whole notion of what we're going to do about climate change. And it's a gigantic opportunity.\nOkay, I called on the Wall Street Journal, Catherine [Catherine Lucy, Wall Street Journal]. I got the wrong one. Sorry. Let's try the real Wall Street Journal.\nWe're going to win. I think we're going to win in Virginia.\nAnd you know—you're reporting it being close—the race is very close. It's about who shows up, who turns out.\nAnd granted, I did win by a large margin, but the point of the matter is that I think that this is—this is going to be what we all knew from the beginning: This is going to be a tight race. And it is tight. And it's going to get down to turnout, and it's going to—my guess is that I'm going to be landing at 1 o'clock in the morning, East Coast time. That's probably about the time we'll be hearing what the final results are. I think we're going to win New Jersey as well.\nBut look, you know, the off year is always unpredictable, especially when we don't have a general election going on at the same time. That's been the case all the—up and down, you know, for a long time, especially as Virginia has turned more and more blue.\nBut having said that, I don't believe—and I've not seen any evidence that whether or not I am doing well or poorly, whether or not I've got my agenda passed or not is going to have any real impact on winning or losing.\nEven if we had passed my agenda, I wouldn't claim, \"We won because Biden's agenda passed.\" So—but I think it's a—I think it's going to be very close. I think it's going to get down to, as you all know, turnout. And I think that, based on what I have heard so far, it's awful hard for me to be prognosticating, which I don't like doing as President anyway, from overseas.\nBut I think—I hope that every eligible voter in Virginia and New Jersey shows up and votes. And the more of them that do, the better off I think our chances are. And I think we're going—I think we're going to win. Okay?\nAll right. NPR, Scott [Scott Horsley, NPR].\nWell, first of all, I think anyone who is focused on the environment should be worried. We've got a lot more to do beyond what we've done. We've done more than we've ever done though; that's the point. And more has to be done.\nAnd I don't find—I didn't have a single member of the—this conference come up to me and say: \"Are you going to pass what you have? And what do you think is—how is that going to affect it? And what are you going to do?\" What they're looking at is what, in fact, has happened in terms of everything from dealing with deforestation to what we're going to do on Build Back Better and how we've been able to focus now.\nI mean, when is the last time you heard world leaders sit down together and agree that what they're going to do is, when they deal with the needs of the infrastructure of other countries, that they're going to focus, first and foremost, on whether or not what the climatic—what the climate impact is on that?\nSo I think—look, this is a—there's a reason for people to be worried. I'm worried. I'm worried if we don't continue to move forward and make the kind of progress we're now making, that it's going to—I mean, we—we throw into jeopardy the prospect that we're going to be able to keep the temperature from rising above 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nBut I'm optimistic because I think there's a—how can I say it? I guess maybe the best way to say it to you, Scott, is: What I feel is that the populations of each of our countries have a different perspective than they did at COP25.\nI think there is—I mean, not because of necessarily any of the leaders of any of our countries, including mine—that all of a sudden, people are seeing these things happening they never thought would happen.\nThey're seeing people drown in their basements in Queens, New York, because of flooding and rain. They're seeing that, you know, more territory burned down in the United States, just since the first of the year, than—it makes up the entire landmass of the State of New Jersey. They've seen a hurricane with a hundred—top winds of 178 miles an hour.\nI mean—so they're looking at these things. They're seeing more—the waters warming. They're seeing a whole range of things occurring around the world that haven't happened. And it's, sort of, like, \"Whoa, whoa.\"\nBecause I don't get what I used to get when I started—I don't—there's no reason why anyone would remember this, but back when a fine Republican, a guy named Dick Lugar, was—from the State of Indiana—and he and I were either the chairmen or ranking members of the Foreign Relations Committee. This was over 20 years ago. We ended up proposing—and it worked, but it got no enthusiasm—a thing for debt-for-nature swaps. And people looked at us like: \"What in the hell are you doing? Why are you forgiving the debt so Brazil won't, you know, burn down more of their forest?\" Or, \"Why are you doing that so they will do\"—now everybody goes: \"Whoa. What else can you do? What else can you do?\"\nSo I think there's a whole different attitude that's out there. And I think this is being led—and I'm not being solicitous here—I think this is being led by, you know, my granddaughters and their friends, that generation. I think they're out there going \"whoa,\" and they're having a profound impact—having a profound impact on their parents and their grandparents about what's happening.\nAnd then all these climactic and—climatic things have happened that they—that people are now paying attention like they never did before.\nSo, you know, there's a lot more to do. And it's going to determine whether or not we are going to be able to fund what we're talking about.\nBut, for example, even if the funding didn't come from some of the governments, you have the private sector now engaged, where they're talking about investing—literally, the need to invest over trillions of dollars off the sidelines. It's bankers that are now deciding they've got to—I talked, a long time ago, with you all about—that you have major corporate America pricing in the price of carbon. It matters.\nSo things are changing. We just have to have the right stewardship and enough sense as world leaders to get it right.\nSo thank you all so very much. Appreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-glasgow-united-kingdom"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2022-01-19", "Text": "Hello, folks. Thanks for being here.\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Tomorrow will mark 1 year since I took office. It's been a year of challenges, but it's also been a year of enormous progress. We went from 2 million people being vaccinated at the moment I was sworn in to 210 million Americans being fully vaccinated today. We created 6 million new jobs, more jobs in 1 year than at any time before.\nUnemployment dropped—the unemployment rate dropped to 3.9 percent. Child poverty dropped by nearly 40 percent—the biggest drop ever in American history. New business applications grew by 30 percent, the biggest increase ever.\nAnd for the first time in a long time, this country's working people actually got a raise—actually got a raise. The people—the bottom 40 percent saw their income go up the most of all those that got a raise.\nWe cut health insurance premiums for millions of American families. And we just made surprise medical bills illegal in this country. You know those bills you get that you don't expect—up to $2,000 or $5,000—from a hospital, beyond what you thought you were going to have to owe because of the consultation you weren't told was going to cost that much? No more. They're now illegal.\nThanks to the American Rescue Plan and other actions we've taken, we've seen record job creation and record economic growth in the past year. Now, thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we're about to make a record investment in rebuilding America to take us to be the number-one best infrastructure in the world. Well, now we're way below that.\nWe'll be creating better jobs for millions of people modernizing our roads, our bridges, our highways, our ports, our airports—everything from making clean water; lead—removing lead pipes that every American can turn on—every American can turn on a faucet and drink clean water: urban and rural and suburban communities.\nIt's going to make affordable high-speed internet available to every American in urban, rural, and suburban areas. We've never done that before. Now we are. We're in the process of that getting that done.\nStill, for all this progress, I know there's a lot of frustration and fatigue in this country. And we know why: COVID-19. Omicron has now been challenging us in a way that—it's the new enemy. But while it's cause for concern, it's not cause for panic.\nWe've been doing everything we can, learning and adapting as fast as we can, and preparing for a future beyond the pandemic. While I know that after almost 2 years of physical, emotional, and psychological weight of this pandemic, and has—the impact it's had on everyone, for many of us, it's been too much to bear. We're in a very different place now though.\nWe have the tools—vaccines, boosters, masks, tests, pills—to save lives and keep businesses and schools open. Seventy-five percent of adults are fully vaccinated. We've gone from 90 million adults with no shots in arms last summer down to 35 million with no shots as of today. And we're adding about 9 million more vaccinations each week.\nWe're going to stick with our vaccination efforts because vaccinations work. So get vaccinated, please. And get your booster.\nLook, we're also increasing testing. Should we have done more testing earlier? Yes. But we're doing more now. We've gone from zero at-home tests a year ago to 375 million tests on the market in just this month. If you buy a test at a store, your insurance will reimburse you.\nOn top of that, we're making 1 billion—1 billion—at-home tests available for you to order and be delivered to your home for free. Just visit COVIDtests.gov to know how to get that free test kit to your home. In addition, there are 20,000 sites where you can get tested in person for free, now.\nAnd now we have more treatments that people can—that—for people—to keep people out of the hospital than any other point in the pandemic, including lifesaving antiviral pills. We purchased 20 million of these new Pfizer pills, more than any country in the world.\nThe bottom line on COVID-19 is that we are in a better place than we've been and have been thus far, clearly better than a year ago. We're not going back—we're not going back to lockdowns. We're not going back to closing schools. Schools should stay open.\nBecause of the American Rescue Plan, we provided to States $130 billion—$130 billion—to keep our students and educators safe and schools open: funding for ventilation systems in schools, social distancing, hygiene for classrooms and the schoolbuses. In addition, we've added another $10 billion for COVID-19 tests to be able to be administered at schools.\nAnd many States and school districts have spent this money very well. Unfortunately, some haven't. I encourage the States and school districts that use the funding to protect our children and keep their schools open: Use it.\nThe COVID-19 is not going to give up and accept things—you know, it's just—it's not going to go away immediately. But I'm not going to give up and accept things as they are now.\nSome people may call what's happening now the \"new normal.\" I call it a job not yet finished. It will get better. We're moving toward a time when COVID-19 won't disrupt our daily lives; where COVID 19 won't be a crisis but something to protect against and a threat [treat].* Look, we're not there yet, but we will get there.\nNow, the second challenge we're facing are prices. COVID-19 has created a lot of economic complications, including rapid price increases across the world economy. People see it at the gas pumps, the grocery stores, and elsewhere.\nSo here's what we're going to do. A critical job in making sure that the elevated prices don't become entrenched rests with the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate: full employment and stable prices. The Federal Reserve provided extraordinary support during the crisis for the previous year and a half.\nGiven the strength of our economy and the pace of recent price increases, it's appropriate, as the Federal Chairman, Chairman Powell—the Fed Chairman, Powell, has indicated—to recalibrate the support that is now necessary.\nI respect the Fed's independence. And I've nominated five superb individuals to serve on the Federal Board of Governors, men and women from a variety of ideological perspectives. They're eminently qualified, historically diverse, and have earned bipartisan praise. And I call on the United States Senate to confirm them without any further delay.\nAnd here at the White House and for my friends in Congress, the best thing to tackle high prices is a more productive economy with greater capacity to deliver goods and services to the American people, and a growing economy where folks have more choices and more small businesses can compete and where more goods can get to market faster and cheaper.\nI've laid out a three-part plan to do just that. First, fix the supply chain. COVID-19 has had a global impact on the economy. When a factory shuts down in one part of the world, shipments to shops and homes and businesses all over the world are disrupted. COVID-19 has compounded that many times over.\nA couple of months ago, in this very room, we talked—we heard dire warnings about how these supply chain problems could create a real crisis around the holidays. So we acted. We brought together business and labor, and that much-predicted crisis did not occur.\nNinety-nine percent of the packages were delivered on time, and shelves were stocked. And notwithstanding the recent storms that have impacted many parts of our country, the share of goods in stock at stores is 89 percent now, which is barely changed from the 91 percent before the pandemic. I often see empty shelves being shown on television. Eighty-nine percent are full, which is only a few points below what it was before the pandemic.\nBut our work is not done. My infrastructure law will supercharge our effort, upgrading everything from roads and bridges to ports and airports, railways and transit, to make the economy move faster and reduce prices for families.\nSecond thing: My Build Back Better plan will address the biggest costs that working families face every day. No other plan will do more to lower the costs for American families. It cuts the cost of—for childcare.\nMany families, including the people sitting in this room, if they have children and they're working full time, many families pay up to $14,000 a year for childcare in big cities, less than that in smaller ones. My plan cuts that in half.\nThat will not only be a game-changer for so many families' budgets, but it will mean so much for the nearly 2 million women who—women who've left the workforce during the pandemic because of things like childcare.\nMy Build Back Better plan cuts the price of prescription drugs. So insulin that today costs some people as much as $1,000 a month will cost no more than $35 a month.\nIt cuts the cost of eldercare. It lowers energy costs. And it will do all of this without raising a single penny in taxes on people making under $400,000 a year or raising the deficit. In fact, my plan cuts the deficit, and it boosts the economy by getting more people into the workforce.\nThat's why 17 Nobel prize winners for economics say it will ease long-term inflationary pressure. The bottom line: If price increases are what you're worried about, the best answer is my Build Back Better plan.\nThird thing we're going to do: promote competition. Look, in too many industries, a handful of giant companies dominate the market in sectors like meat processing, railroads, shipping, and other areas. This isn't a new issue. It's not been the reason we've have high inflation today. It's not the only reason. It's been happening for a decade.\nBut over time, it has reduced competition; squeezed out small businesses and farmers, ranchers; and increased the price for consumers. We end up with an industry like the meat-processing industry where four big companies dominate the markets, pay ranchers less for their cattle they grow, charge consumers more for beef, hamburger meat, whatever they're buying. Prices are up.\nLook, I'm a capitalist. But capitalism without competition is not capitalism, it's exploitation. So I signed an Executive order to tackle unfair competition in our economy, and we're going to continue to enforce it, along with working with Congress where we can.\nI'll close with this: We have faced some of the biggest challenges that we've ever faced in this country these past few years: challenges to our public health, challenges to our economy. But we're getting through it. And not only are we getting through it, we're laying the foundation for a future where America wins the 21st century by creating jobs at a record pace. Now we need to get inflation under control.\nWe have developed an extraordinarily effective booster shots and antiviral pills. Now we need to finish the job to get COVID-19 under control.\nI've long said it's never been a good bet to bet against the American people or America. I believe that more than ever today. We've seen the grit and determination of the American people this past year. But the best days of this country are still ahead of us, not behind us.\nNow I'm happy to take questions.\nWhy are you such an optimist? [Laughter]\nLook, I didn't overpromise, and—but I have probably outperformed what anybody thought would happen. The fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where we have made enormous progress. You mentioned the number of deaths from COVID; well, it was three times that not long ago. It's coming down. Everything is changing. It's getting better.\nLook, I didn't overpromise, but I think if you take a look at what we've been able to do, you'd have to acknowledge we made enormous progress.\nBut one of the things that I think is something that—one thing I haven't been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game of making things better in this country. For example, I was reading the other day—and I wrote the quote down so I don't misquote him—a quote from Senator Sununu, when he decided that he wasn't going to—excuse me, Governor Sununu—when he decided he wasn't going to run for the Senate in New Hampshire.\nHere's what he said: \"They were all, for the most\"—quote—\"They were all, for the most part, content with the speed at which they weren't doing anything. It was very clear that we just had to hold the line for 2 years. Okay, so I'm just going to be a roadblock for the next 2 years? That's not what I do,\" Sununu said.\nHe went on to say, \"It bothered me that they were okay with that.\" And then he goes on to say, \"I said, okay, so we're not going to get stuff done if we win the White House back\"—\"if we win the White House back.\" \"Why didn't [we] do [anything] in 2017 and 2018?\" And then, he said—how did the Republicans Sununu spoke to answer the challenge? He said: \"Crickets. Yes, crickets. They had no answer.\"\nI did not anticipate that there'd be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn't get anything done. Think about this: What are Republicans for? What are they for? Name me one thing they're for.\nAnd so the problem here is that I think what happens—what I have to do, and the change in tactic, if you will: I have to make clear to the American people what we are for. We've passed a lot. We've passed a lot of things that people don't even understand what's all that's in it, understandably.\nRemember when we passed the Affordable Care Act and everybody thought that—you know, and it really was getting pummeled and beaten? And it wasn't until after you're out of office, and that next campaign when—that off-year campaign. And I went into a whole—I wasn't in office anymore. We were in a whole bunch of districts campaigning for Democrats in Republican districts who said they wanted to do away with health care, with Obamacare.\nAnd I started pointing out that if you did that, preexisting conditions would no longer be covered. And they said: \"Huh? We didn't know that. We didn't know that.\" And guess what? We won over 38 seats because we explained to the people exactly what, in fact, had passed.\nAnd one of the things that I remember saying—and I'll end this—I remember saying to President Obama, when he passed the Affordable Care Act—I said, \"You ought to take a victory lap.\" And he said, \"There's so many things going on, we have don't have time to take a victory lap.\"\nAs a consequence, no one knew what the detail of the legislation was. They don't know a lot of the detail of what we passed. So the difference is, I'm going to be out on the road a lot, making the case around the country, with my colleagues who are up for reelection and others, making the case of what we did do and what we want to do, what we need to do.\nAnd so I don't think I've overpromised at all. And I'm going to stay on this track.\nYou know, one of the things that I remember—and I'll end this with—I was talking with, you know, Jim Clyburn, who was a great help to me in the campaign in South Carolina. And Jim said—and when he would endorse me—and there was a clip on television the last couple days of Jim. And it said that we want to make things accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's health care, that's education, that's prescription drugs, that's making sure you have access—access—to all the things that everybody else has. We can afford to do that. We can't afford not to do it.\nSo I tell my Republican friends: Here I come. This is going to be about, \"What are you for?\"—\"What are you for?\"—and lay out what we're for.\nMary Bruce, ABC.\nNo, I don't think so. When you say \"more realistic,\" I think it's extremely realistic to say to people, because—let me back up. You all really know the politics in this country, and your networks and others. You've spent a lot of time, which I'm glad you do, polling this data, determining where the—what the American people's attitudes are, et cetera. The American people overwhelmingly agree with me on prescription drugs. They overwhelmingly agree with me on the cost of education. They overwhelmingly agree with me on early education. They overwhelmingly—and go on the list—on childcare.\nAnd so we just have to make the case what we're for and what the other team is not for. Look, we knew all along that a lot of this was going to be an uphill fight. And one of the ways to do this is to make sure we make the contrast as clear as we can.\nAnd one of the things that I think is—we're going to have to do is just make the case. I don't think there's anything unrealistic about what we're asking. I'm not trying to—I'm not asking for castles in the sky; I'm asking for practical things the American people have been asking for for a long time—a long time. And I think we can get it done.\nOh, I got two real big ones done, bigger than any President has ever gotten in the first year. [Laughter]\nThat's true.\nYes, I'm confident we can get pieces—big chunks—of the Build Back Better law signed into law.\nAnd I'm confident that we can take the case to the American people that the people they should be voting for—who are going to oversee whether your elections, in fact, are legit or not—should not be those who are being put up by the Republicans to determine that they're going to be able to change the outcome of the election.\nSo whether or not we can actually get election—and by the way, I haven't given up. We haven't finished the vote yet on what's going on the—on voting rights and the John Lewis bill and others.\nBut so, look, this is—I've been engaged a long time in public policy. And I don't know many things that have been done in one fell swoop. And so I think the best—the most important thing to do is try to inform—not educate—inform the public of what's at stake, in stark terms, and let them make judgments, and let them know who's for them and who's against them, who's there and who's not there, and make that the case. And that's what I'm going to be spending my time doing in this off-year election.\nWell, I like Mitt—look, Mitt Romney is a straight guy. He's—and one of the things that we're doing, I was trying to make sure we got everybody on the same page in my party on this score. And I didn't call many Republicans at all.\nThe fact is that there—I do think that Mitt is a serious guy. I think we can get things done. I think—I predict to you they'll get something done on the electoral reform side of this.\nBut rather than judge what's going to get done and not get done, all I can say is, I'm going to continue to make the case why it's so important to not turn the electoral process over to political persons who are set up deliberately to change the outcome of elections.\nThe—Allison Harris [NewsNation], please.\nWell, it all depends on whether or not we're able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election. And it's one thing—look, maybe I'm just being too much of an optimist. Remember how we thought not that many people were going to show up to vote in the middle of a pandemic? We had the highest voter turnout in the history of the United States of America.\nWell, I think if in fact—no matter how hard they make it for minorities to vote, I think you're going to see them willing to stand in line and defy the attempt to keep them from being able to vote. I think you're going to see the people who they're trying to keep from being able to show up, showing up and making the sacrifice that needs to make in order to change the law back to what it should be.\nAnd—but it's going to be difficult. I make no bones about that. It's going to be difficult. But we're not there yet. We've not run out of options yet. And we'll see how this moves.\nFirst of all, I'd put in perspective the question you asked. Very few schools are closing. Over 95 percent are still open.\nSo you all phrase the questions when people—I don't think it's deliberate on your part, but you phrase the question—if anyone watches this on television—\"My God, there must be—all those schools must be closing. What are we going to do?\" Ninety-five percent are still open, number one.\nNumber two, the idea that parents don't think it's important for their children to be in school, and teachers know it as well—that's why we made sure that we had the ability to provide the funding through the Recovery Act—through the act that we—the first act we passed—to be able to make sure schools were able to be safe.\nSo we have new ventilation systems available for them. We have—the way they handle—they scrub down laboratories and—I mean, the lavatories kids go to, to go to the bathroom—cafeterias, buses, et cetera. That—all that money is there. There's billions of dollars made available. That's there.\nNot every school district has used it as well as it should be used. But it's there. And so, in addition to that, there is now another $10 billion for testing of students in the schools.\nSo I think, as time goes on, it's much more likely you're going to see that number go back up from 95 percent, back up to 98, 99 percent.\nBut the outfit of the individuals of the district that says \"We're not going to be open\" is always going to get—and I'm not being critical of any of you—it's always going to get front page. It's always going to be the top of the news. But let's put it in perspective: 95—as high as 98—percent of the schools in America are open, functioning, and capable doing the job.\nHow about Jen Epstein, Bloomberg?\nWell, because he's never seen sanctions like the ones I promised will be imposed if he moves, number one.\nNumber two, we're in a situation where Vladimir Putin is about to—we've had very frank discussions, Vladimir Putin and I. And the idea that NATO is not going to be united, I don't buy. I've spoken to every major NATO leader. We've had the NATO-Russian summit. We've had other—the OSCE has met, et cetera.\nAnd so I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades. And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.\nBut if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border, it is going to be a disaster for Russia if they further invade Ukraine, and that our allies and partners are ready to impose severe costs and significant harm on Russia and the Russian economy.\nAnd you know, we're going to fortify our NATO allies, I told him, on the eastern flank—if, in fact, he does invade. We're going to—I've already shipped over $600 million worth of sophisticated equipment, defensive equipment to the Ukrainians.\nThe cost of going into Ukraine, in terms of physical loss of life, for the Russians, they'll—they'll be able to prevail over time, but it's going to be heavy, it's going to be real, and it's going to be consequential.\nIn addition to that, Putin has—you know, has a stark choice: He—either deescalation or diplomacy; confrontation or the consequences.\nAnd look, I think you're going to see—for example, everybody talks about how Russia has control over the energy supply that Europe absorbs. Well, guess what? That money that they earn from that makes about 45 percent of the economy. I don't see that as a one-way street. They go ahead and cut it off—it's like my mother used to say: \"You bite your nose off to spite your face.\" It's not like they have all these wonderful choices out there.\nI spoke with the Prime Minister of Finland. And you know, we're talking about concern on the part of Finland and Sweden about what Russia is doing. The last thing that Russia needs is Finland deciding to change its status. They didn't say they're going to do that, but they're talking about what, in fact, is going on and how outrageous Russia is being.\nWe're finding ourselves in a position where I believe you will see that there'll be severe economic consequences. For example, anything that involves dollar denominations, if they make—if they invade, they're going to pay; they're not going—their banks will not be able to deal in dollars.\nSo there's—a lot is going to happen.\nBut here's the thing: My conversation with Putin—and we've been—how can we say it? We have no problem understanding one another. He has no problem understanding me, nor me him. And the direct conversations where I pointed out—I said: \"You know, you've occupied, before, other countries. But the price has been extremely high. How long? You can go in and, over time, at great loss and economic loss, go in and occupy Ukraine. But how many years? One? Three? Five? Ten? What is that going to take? What toll does that take?\" It's real. It's consequential.\nSo this is not all just a cakewalk for Russia.\nMilitarily, they have overwhelming superiority, and on—as it relates to Ukraine. But they'll pay a stiff price—immediately, near term, medium term, and long term—if they do it.\nUmm—I'm sorry. Okay. David Sanger, New York Times.\nThe answer is that I think he still does not want any full-blown war, number one.\nNumber two, do I think he'll test the west, test the United States and NATO as significantly as he can? Yes, I think he will. But I think he'll pay a serious and dear price for it that he doesn't think now will cost him what it's going to cost him. And I think he will regret having done it.\nNow, whether or not—I think that—how can I say this in a public forum? I think that he is dealing with what I believe he thinks is the most tragic thing that's happened to Mother Russia—in that the Berlin Wall came down, the empire has been lost, the \"near abroad\" is gone, et cetera. The Soviet Union has been split.\nBut think about what he has. He has eight time zones, a burning tundra that will not freeze again naturally, a situation where he has a lot of oil and gas, but he is trying to find his place in the world between China and the west.\nAnd so I'm not so sure that he has—David, I'm not so sure he has—is certain what he's going to do. My guess is he will move in. He has to do something.\nAnd by the way, I've indicated to him—the two things he said to me that he wants guarantees of: One is, Ukraine will never be part of NATO. And two, that NATO, or the—there will not be strategic weapons stationed in Ukraine. Well, we could work out something on the second piece, depending what he does along the Russian line as well—or the Russian border, in the European area of Russia.\nOn the first piece, we have a number of treaties internationally and in Europe that suggest that you get to choose who you want to be with. But the likelihood that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the near term is not very likely, based on much more work they have to do in terms of democracy and a few other things going on there and whether or not the major allies in the west would vote to bring Ukraine in right now.\nSo there's room to work if he wants to do that. But I think, as usual, he's going to—well, I probably shouldn't go any further. But I think it will hurt him badly.\nNo. No, there's not space for that. We won't permanently station. But the idea we're not going to—we're going to actually increase troop presence in Poland, in Romania, et cetera, if in fact he moves because we have a sacred obligation in article 5 to defend those countries. They are part of NATO. We don't have that obligation relative to Ukraine, although we have great concern about what happens in Ukraine.\nThank you.\nMaureen [Maureen Groppe], USA Today.\nNo, look, first of all, on the last part of the question: The Supreme Court decision, I think, was a mistake. But you still see thousands and thousands of people who work for major corporations having to be tested as a consequence of the decision made by the corporation and not by the standard I set that is there. I think you'll see that increase, not decrease, number one.\nWhat was the first part of your question?\nYes.\nYes.\nYes. Well, it's clear to me that—that we're going to have to probably break it up. I think that we can get—and I've been talking to a number of my colleagues on the Hill—I think it's clear that we would be able to get support for the 500-plus billion dollars for energy and the environmental issues that are there, number one.\nNumber two, I know that the two people who've opposed, on the Democratic side at least, support a number of the things that are in there. For example, Joe Manchin strongly supports early education, 3 and 4 years of age. Strongly supports that. There is strong support for, I think, a number of the way in which to pay for these—pay for this proposal.\nSo I think there is—and I'm not going to—I'm not going to negotiate against myself as to what should and shouldn't be in it, but I think we can break the package up, get as much as we can now, and come back and fight for the rest later.\nKen, the Wall Street Journal. Ken Thomas.\nYes.\nWell, look, as you know, Ken, the inflation has everything to do with the supply chain. And I think what you're seeing is that we've been able to make progress on speeding up the access to materials. For example, one third of the cost—of the increase in cost of living is the cost of automobiles.\nThe reason automobiles have skyrocketed in price is because of the lack of computer chips. So we have the capacity, and we're going to do everything in our power to do it to become self-reliant on the computer chips that we need in order to be able to produce more automobiles. That's underway.\nWe've already passed, within the context of another bill, money for that in the—in the House of Representatives. It's before the House of Representatives now. But I think there's a way we can move to—if we can move to get, for example, that one thing done, it can make a big difference in terms of the cost of—the total cost of living.\nNow, with regard to the whole issue of energy prices, that gets a little more complicated. But you saw what happened when I was able to convince everyone from—including China, India—a number of other countries—to agree with us to go into their version of the—of their petroleum reserve to release more into the market so that—that brought down the price about 12, 15 cents a gallon in some places, some places more.\nThere's going to be a reckoning along the line here as to whether or not we're going to continue to see oil prices continue to go up in ways that are going up now, relative to what is going to—what impact that's going to have on the producers.\nAnd so it's going to be hard. I think that's the place where most middle class people, working class people get hit the most. They pull up to a pump, and all of a sudden, instead of paying $2.40 a gallon, they're paying $5 a gallon. And that's going to be really difficult.\nBut—so we're going to continue to work on trying to increase oil supplies that are available. And I think there's ways in which we can be of some value added in terms of the price of gas—natural gas and the like—to take the burden off of European countries that are now totally dependent on Russia. But it's going to be hard. It's going to be very hard.\nBut I think that we have to deal with—for example, like I said, you have a circumstance where people are paying more for a pound of hamburger meat than they ever paid. Well, one of the reasons for that is, you don't have that many folks out there that are ones that are—we've got the Big Four controlling it all.\nAnd so you're going to see, more and more, we're going to move on this competition piece to allow more and more smaller operations to come in and be able to engage in providing—buying and providing the access to much cheaper meat than exists now. But it's going to be a haul.\nNow, and as you—I assume the reason you said if I can't get Build Back Better is, it relates to what those 17 Nobel laureate economists said: that if in fact we could pass it, it would actually lower the impact on inflation, reduce inflation over time, et cetera.\nSo there's a lot we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but I think we can get it done. But it's going to be painful for a lot of people in the meantime. That's why the single best way—the single best way—to take the burden off middle class and working class folks is to pass the Build Back Better piece that are things that they're paying a lot of money for it now.\nIf you get to trade off higher gas as—you're putting up with a higher price of hamburgers and gas, versus whether or not you're going to have to—you're going to be able to pay for education and/or childcare and the like, I think most people would make the trade. Their bottom line would be better in middle class households.\nBut it's going to be hard. And it's going to take a lot of work.\nChina-U.S. Trade\nWell, I know that, and that's why my Trade Rep is working on that right now. The answer is uncertain. It's uncertain.\nI'd like to be able to be in a position where I can say they're meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we're not there yet.\nNancy [Nancy Cordes], CBS.\nI think the report card is going to look pretty good, if that's where we're at. But look, the idea that—Mitch has been very clear he's going to do anything to prevent Biden from being a success.\nAnd I get on with Mitch. I actually like Mitch McConnell. We like one another. But he has one straightforward objective: make sure that there's nothing I do that makes me look good in the mind—in his mind with the public at large. And that's okay. I'm a big boy. I've been here before.\nBut the fact is that I think that the—I'm happy to debate and have a referendum on how I handle the economy, whether or not I've made progress on when—look, again—how can I—I'm taking too long answering your questions. I apologize.\nI think that this—the fundamental question is: What's Mitch for? What's he for on immigration? What's he for? What's he proposing to make anything better? What's he for dealing with Russia that's different than I'm proposing and many of his Republican friends or his colleagues are supporting as well? What's he for on these things? What are they for?\nSo everything is a choice—a choice.\nI think they—look, I've laid out a proposal on immigration that if we passed it, we'd be in a totally different place right now. But we're not there because we don't have a single Republican vote. My buddy John McCain is gone.\nSo, I mean, it's just—it's going to take time. And again, I go back to—I go back to Governor Sununu's quote.\nHow long—I mean—a rhetorical question. I don't—I know this is not fair to ask the press a question; I'm not asking you. But think about—did you ever think that one man out of office could intimidate an entire party where they're unwilling to take any vote contrary to what he thinks should be taken for fear of being defeated in a primary?\nI've had five Republican Senators talk to me, \"bump into me\"—quote, unquote—or sit with me, who've told me that they agree with whatever I'm talking about for them to do. \"But, Joe, if I do it, I'm going to get defeated in a primary.\" We've got to break that. That's got to change.\nAnd I doubt—you're all—I'm not being—it sounds like I'm being solicitous—you're all bright as hell, well informed—more informed than any group of people in America. But did any of you think that you'd get to a point where not a single Republican would diverge on a major issue? Not one?\nSure. No. [Laughter] Are you kidding me? I maintain confidentiality.\nBut I'm sure you've spoken to some. [Laughter]\nYes.\nWell, I'm not prepared to do that in detail, in terms of the Executive orders I may be able to engage in and other things I can do. But one of—the things we have done: We have significantly beefed up a number of enforcers in the Justice Department, who are there to challenge these unconstitutional efforts—in our view—unconstitutional efforts on the part of the Republicans to stack the election and subvert the outcome.\nWe have begun to organize in ways that we didn't before in communities beyond the civil rights community to make the case to the rest of American people what's about to happen, what will happen if in fact these things move forward.\nIf I had talked to you—not you; I'm using \"you\" in a total sense. If I had talked to the public about the whole idea of subversion of elections by deciding who the electors are after the fact, I think people would've looked at me like, \"Whoa.\"\nI mean, I caught—taught constitutional law for 20 years—a three-credit course on the separation of powers. And—on Saturday mornings, when I was a Senator. And I never thought we'd get into a place where we were talking about being able to actually—what they tried to do this last time out is send different electors to the State legislative bodies to represent who won the election, saying that I didn't win, but a Republican candidate won. I doubt that anybody thought that would ever happen in America in the 21st century, but it's happening.\nAnd so I think—I guess what I'm saying is, Nancy—is that I think there are a number of things we can do, but I also think we will be able to get significant pieces of the legislation—if we don't get it all now—to build to get it so that we get a big chunk of the John Lewis legislation, as well as the fair elections bills.\nYes.\nNo, it's not that at all. It's just, this has become clearer and clearer, and every time I speak of it, I say: If you've been vaccinated, get your booster shot. Everybody get the booster shot. It's the optimum protection you could have. You're protected very well with two shots, if it's the Pfizer—anyway, you're protected. But you are better protected with the booster shot.\nI'm following what the—the answer is, yes. Get the booster shot. It's all part of the same thing. You're better protected.\n[Laughter] Good question.\nThat's how it did sound like, didn't it?\nThe most important thing to do: Big nations can't bluff, number one. And number two, the idea that we would do anything to split NATO, which would be a—have a profound impact on one of—I think prominent impact—on one of Putin's objectives is to weaken NATO—would be a big mistake.\nSo the question is, if it's a—something significantly short of a significant invasion—or not even significant, just major military forces coming across—for example, it's one thing to determine that if they continue to use cyber efforts, well, we can respond the same way, with cyber.\nThey have FSB people in Ukraine now trying to undermine the solidarity within Ukraine about Russia and to try to promote Russian interest. But it's very important that we keep everyone in NATO on the same page. And that's what I'm spending a lot of time doing. And there are differences. There are differences in NATO as to what countries are willing to do depending on what happens, the degree to which they're able to go.\nAnd I want to be clear with you: The serious imposition of sanctions relative to dollar transactions and other things are things that are going to have a negative impact on the United States, as well as a negative impact on the economies of Europe as well, and a devastating impact on Russia. And so I've got to make sure everybody is on the same page as we move along.\nI think we will, if there's something that is—that—where there's Russian forces crossing the border, killing Ukrainian fighters, et cetera—I think that changes everything. But it depends on what he does, as to the exact—to what extent we're going to be able to get total unity on the Russia—on the NATO front.\nI'll do it in reverse. It's not time to give up. There is some progress being made. The P5-plus-1 is on the same page. But it remains to be seen.\nLook, the only thing I'm confident of is that decision is totally, solely, completely a Putin decision. Nobody else is going to make that decision; no one else is going to impact that decision. He's making that decision.\nAnd I suspect it matters which side of the bed he gets up on in the morning as to exactly what he's going to do. And I think it is not irrational, if he wanted to, to talk about dealing with strategic doctrine and dealing with force structures in Europe and in the European parts of Russia.\nBut I don't know if he's decided he wants to do that or not. So far, in the three meetings we've had—OSCE and—anyway—have not produced anything because the impression I get from my Secretary of State, my National Security Adviser, and my other senior officials that are doing these meetings is that there's a question of whether the people they're talking to know what he's going to do.\nSo the answer is—but based on a number of criteria as to what he could do—for example, for him to move in and occupy the whole country, particularly from the north, from Belarus, it's—he's going to have to wait a little bit until the ground is frozen so he can cross.\nTo move in a direction where he wants to talk about what's going—we have—we're continuing to provide for defense capacities to the Ukrainians. We're talking about what's going on in both the Baltic and the Black Sea, et cetera. There's a whole range of things that I'm sure he's trying to calculate how quickly he can do what he wants to do and what does he want to do.\nBut I—he's not—he's an informed individual. And I'm sure—I'm not sure—I believe he's calculating what the immediate, short-term, and the near-term, and the long-term consequences of Russia will be. And I don't think he's made up his mind yet.\nYes.\nI've had their back. I've had their back my entire career. I've never not had their back. And I started on the voting rights issues long, long ago. That's what got me involved in politics in the first place.\nAnd I think part of the problem is—look, there's significant disagreement in every community on whether or not the timing of assertions made by people has been in a most timely way. So I'm sure that there are those who are saying that: \"Why didn't Biden push the John Lewis bill as hard as he pushed it the last month? Why didn't he push it 6 months ago as hard as he did now?\"\nThe fact is that there is—there's a timing that is not of one's own choice; it's somewhat dictated by events that are happening in country and around the world as to what the focus is.\nBut part of the problem is, as well, I have not been out in the community nearly enough. I've been here an awful lot. I find myself in a situation where I don't get a chance to look people in the eye, because of both COVID and things that are happening in Washington, to be able to go out and do the things that I've always been able to do pretty well: connect with people, let them take a measure of my sincerity, let them take a measure of who I am.\nFor example—I mean, as I pointed out in South Carolina, you know, last time, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I got the Voting Rights Act extended for 25 years, and I got Strom Thurmond to vote for it. That's what I've been doing my whole career. And so the idea that I—that I didn't either anticipate or because I didn't speak to it as fervently as they want me to earlier.\nIn the meantime, I was spending a lot of time—spent hours and hours and hours talking with my colleagues on the Democratic side, trying to get them to agree that if in fact this occurred, if this push continued, that they would be there for John Lewis and—anyway.\nSo—but I think that's—that's a problem that is my own making by not communicating as much as I should have. Yet you find that when you deal with Members of the Black Caucus and others in the United States Congress, I still have very close working relationships.\nSo it's like every community. I'm sure that there are those in the community, in—I'm a big labor guy. I'm sure there's people in labor saying, \"Why haven't they been able to do A, B, C, or D?\"\nSo it's just going to take a little bit of time.\nYes, and yes.\nPardon me?\nNo, there's no need to.\nI mean, I asked the—he—she is going to be my running mate—number one. And number two, I did put her in charge. I think she's doing a good job. [Laughter]\nYes.\nNumber one: Anybody who listened to the speech—I did not say that they were going to be a George Wallace or a Bull Connor. I said we're going to have a decision in history that is going to be marked just like it was then. You either voted on the side—that didn't make you a George Wallace or didn't make you a Bull Connor.\nBut if you did not vote for the Voting Rights Act back then, you were voting with those who agreed with Connor, those who agreed with—and so—and I think Mitch did a real good job of making it sound like I was attacking them. If you've noticed, I haven't attacked anybody publicly—any Senator, any—any Congressman publicly. And my disagreements with them have been made to them—communicated to them privately or in person with them.\nMy desire still is—look, I underestimated one very important thing: I never thought that the Republicans—like, for example, I said—they got very upset—I said there are 16 Members of the present United States Senate who voted to extend the Voting Rights Act.\nNow, they got very offended by that. That wasn't an accusation; I was just stating a fact. What has changed? What happened? What happened? Why is there not a single Republican, not one? That's not the Republican Party.\nSo that's not an attack.\nThe answer is: Based on some of the stuff we've got done, I'd say yes, but it's not nearly unified as it should be.\nLook, I still contend—and I know you'll have a right to judge me by this—I still contend that unless you can reach consensus in a democracy, you cannot sustain the democracy.\nAnd so this is a real test—whether or not my counterpart in China is right or not when he says autocracies are the only thing that could prevail because democracies take too long to make decisions and countries are too divided.\nI believe we're going through one of those inflection points in history that occurs every several generations or even more than that—even more time than that, where things are changing almost regardless of any particular policy.\nThe world is changing in big ways. We're going to see—you've heard me say this before—we're going to see more change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 years because of technology, because of fundamental alterations and alliances that are occurring not because of any one individual, just because of the nature of things.\nAnd so I think you're going to see an awful lot of transition. And the question is: Can we keep up with it? Can we maintain the democratic institutions that we have, not just here but around the world, to be able to generate democratic consensus of how to proceed?\nIt's going to be hard. It's going to be hard, but it requires—it requires—leadership to do it. And I'm not giving up on the prospect of being able to do that.\nThank you.\nLook, let's take Afghanistan. I know you all would like to focus on that, which is legitimate. We were spending a trillion dollars a week—I mean, a billion dollars a week in Afghanistan for 20 years.\nRaise your hand if you think anyone was going to be able to unify Afghanistan under one single Government. It's been the graveyard of empires for a solid reason: It is not susceptible to unity, number one.\nSo the question was: Do I continue to spend that much money per week in the state of Afghanistan, knowing that the idea that being able to succeed—other than sending more body bags back home—is highly, highly unusual?\nMy dad used to have an expression. He'd say, \"Son, if everything is equally important to you, nothing is important to you.\" There was no way to get out of Afghanistan, after 20 years, easily. Not possible no matter when you did it. And I make no apologies for what I did.\nI have a great concern for the women and men who were blown up on the line at the airport by a terrorist attack against them. But the military will acknowledge—and I think you will, who know a lot about foreign policy—that had we stayed and I had not pull those troops out, we would be asked to put somewhere between 20- and 50,000 more troops back in.\nBecause the only reason more Americans weren't being killed—and others—is because the last President signed an agreement to get out by May the 1st, and so everything was copacetic.\nHad we not gotten out—and the acknowledgement is, we'd be putting a lot more forces in. You know, am I—do I feel badly what's happening to—as a consequence of the incompetence of the Taliban? Yes, I do.\nBut I feel badly also about the fistulas that are taking place in the Eastern Congo. I feel badly about a whole range of things around the world—that we can't solve every problem. And so I don't view that as a competence issue.\nThe issue of whether or not there's competence, in terms of whether or not we're dealing with 5G or not: We don't deal with 5G. The fact is that you had two enterprises—two private enterprises—that had one promoting 5G and the other one are airlines. They're private enterprises. They have Government regulation, admittedly.\nAnd so what I've done is pushed as hard as I can to have 5G folks hold up and abide by what was being requested by the airlines until they could more modernize over the years so that 5G would not interfere with the potential of the landing. So any tower—any 5G tower within a certain number of miles from the airport should not be operative.\nAnd that's—and so I understand. But anything that happens that's consequential is viewed as the Government's responsibility. I get that.\nAm I satisfied with the way in which we have dealt with COVID and all the things that—that go along with it? Yes, I am satisfied. I think we've done remarkably well.\nOn testing, we've done—we should have done it quicker, but we've done remarkable since then. What we have is, we have more testing going on than anywhere in the world. And we're going to continue to increase that.\nDid we have it at the moment exactly when we should have moved, and could we have moved a month earlier? Yes, we could have. But with everything else that was going on, I don't view that as somehow a mark of incompetence.\nLook, think of what we did on COVID. When—when we were pushing on AstraZeneca [Pfizer]* to provide more vaccines—well, guess what? They didn't have the machinery to be able to do it. So I physically went to Michigan, stood there in a factory with the head of the—of AstraZeneca [Pfizer],* and said, \"We'll provide the machinery for you. This is what we'll do. We'll help you do it so that you can produce this vaccine more rapidly.\" I think that's pretty hands-on stuff.\nWe also said, right now, when people—the hospitalizations are—are overrunning hospitals and you have docs and nurses out because of COVID—they have COVID—we put thousands of people back in those hospitals. Look at all the marines—all the military personnel we have there, first responders.\nNobody has ever organized—nobody has ever organized a strategic operation to get as many shots in arms by opening clinics and keeping—and being able to get so many people vaccinated.\nWhat I'm doing now is not just getting significant amounts of vaccines to the rest of the world, but they now need—the mechanical way is how they get shots in arms. So we're providing them the know-how to do that. Now, should everybody in America know that? No, they don't necessarily know that; they're just trying to figure how to put three squares on the table and stay safe.\nBut so I do think the place where I was a little disappointed—I wish we could have written it differently—is when we did the legislation to provide the funding for COVID and the money we provided for the States to be able to deal with keeping schools open.\nSome of them didn't do a very good job. Some are still holding the money. I don't have the authority to do anything about that. I think that's not particularly competent. There's things that could and should have been done, that could have moved faster.\nSo I understand the frustration. You know, I remember—I think it was—I forget which Cabinet member was saying to Barack Obama—something was going on, and he said: \"Well, you can be sure, Mr. President, of the millions of employees you have out there, somebody is screwing up right now. Somebody is screwing up.\"\nSo it's—you know, it's just a—but I think you have to look at things that we used to look at it on balance. What is the trajectory of the country? Is it moving in the right direction now?\nI don't know how we can say it's not. I understand the overwhelming frustration, fear, and concern with regard to inflation and COVID. I get it. But the idea—if I told you, when we started, I told you what I'm going to do—\"The first year, I'm going to create over 600—or 6 million jobs. I'm going to get unemployment down to 3.9 percent. I'm going to generate\"—and I named it all, you'd look at me like, \"You're nuts.\" Maybe I'm wrong.\nI'm satisfied with the team.\nThere's three things I'm going to do differently now that I will—now that I've gotten the critical crises out of the way, in the sense of that moving—knowing exactly where we're going.\nNumber one, I'm going to get out of this place more often. I'm going to go out and talk to the public. I'm going to do public fora. I'm going to interface with them. I'm going to make the case of what we've already done, why it's important, and what we'll do if—what will happen if they support what else I want to do.\nNumber two, I'm bringing in more and more—now that I have time—I mean, literally, like you, it's—I'm not complaining. It's, you know, 12, 14 hours a day. No complaints. I really mean that sincerely.\nBut now that certain of the big chunks have been put in place and we know the direction, I'm also going to be out there seeking the—more advice of experts outside, from academia, to editorial writers, to think tanks. And I'm bringing them in, just like I did early on, bringing in Presidential historians to get their perspective on what we should be doing. Seeking more input, more information, more constructive criticism about what I should and shouldn't be doing.\nAnd the third thing I'm going to be doing a lot more of is being in a situation where I am able to bring—I'm going to be deeply involved in the off—these off-year elections. We're going to be raising a lot of money. We're going to be out there making sure that we're helping all of those candidates.\nAnd scores of them have already asked me to come in and campaign with them, to go out and make the case in plain, simple language as to what it is we've done, what we want to do, and why we think it's important.\nHow many more hours am I doing this? I'm happy to stick around.\nYou always ask me the nicest questions.\nI know you do.\nNone of them make a lot of sense to me, but I—[laughter].\nFire away. Come on.\nWell, I'm not. I don't know what you consider to be too far to the left if, in fact, we're talking about making sure that we had the money for COVID, making sure we had the money to put together the bipartisan infrastructure, and making sure we were able to provide for those things that, in fact, would significantly reduce the burden on the working class people but make them—they have to continue to work hard. I don't know how that is pointed to the left.\nIf you may recall, I—you guys have been trying to convince me that I am Bernie Sanders. I'm not. I like him, but I'm not Bernie Sanders. I'm not a Socialist. I'm a mainstream Democrat, and I have been. And mainstream Democrats have overwhelmingly—if you notice, the 48 of the 50 Republican—Democrats supported me in the Senate on virtually everything I've asked.\nYes, sir.\nOh, yes, I think it easily could be illegitimate.\nImagine—imagine—if in fact Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes.\nGo on.\nOh, 2022. I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit. \"You have to recount it, and we're not going to count—we're going to discard the following votes.\" I mean, sure, but—I'm not going to say it's going to be legit. It's—the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these reforms passed.\nBut I don't think you're going to see—you're not going to see me and I don't think you're going to see the Democratic Party give up on—coming back and assuming that the attempt fails today.\nNo, I didn't say that. Look what I said. Go back and read what I said and tell me if you think I called anyone who voted on the side of the position taken by Bull Connor that they were Bull Connor.\nThat is an interesting reading of English. You—I assume you got into journalism because you liked to write.\nNo, here's the thing: There's certain things that are so consequential you have to speak from your heart as well as your head. I was speaking out forcefully on what I think to be at stake. That's what it is.\nAnd by the way, no one—no one—forgets who was on the side of King or—versus on—or Bull Connor. No one not—does not. The history books will note it. And what—I was making the case: \"Don't think this is a freebie. You don't get to vote this way, and then somehow it goes away. This will be—stick with you the rest of your career and long after you're gone.\"\nOkay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on, guys. We've only gone an hour and 20 minutes. I'll keep going.\nBut I'm—but I'm going to go—let me get—let get something straight here: How long are you guys ready to go? You want to go for another hour or two?\nOkay. I'm going to go—I'll tell you what, folks: I am going to go another 20 minutes, until a quarter of. Okay?\nYes, sir.\nI want to thank my communications staff for the great help here. [Laughter]\nThe answer is that we did—I did raise the question of transparency. I spent a lot of time with him. And he—the fact is that they're just not—they're just not being transparent.\nYes.\nYes.\nWell—and they weren't with me the entire time. Look, I made it clear that I thought that China had an obligation to be more forthcoming on exactly what the source of the virus was and where it came from.\nThe answer is, it's under consideration. And ending the war in Yemen takes the two parties to be involved to do it. And it's going to be very difficult.\nWell, I'll let you all make the judgment whether they're correct. Thank you.\nI have no idea.\nYes, sir.\nWe have to. We have to. And let me—I'm not—as long as I hold public office, I'm going to continue to attempt to do both things.\nCan you think of any other President that has done as much in 1 year? Name one for me.\nI'm serious. You guys talk about how nothing has happened. I don't think there's been much on any incoming President's plate that's been a bigger menu than the plate I had given to me. I'm not complaining. I knew that running in.\nAnd the fact of the matter is, we got an awful lot done—an awful lot done—and there's more to get done.\nBut look, let's—let me ask you a rhetorical question. No, I won't. Anyway. [Laughter]\nThank you.\nYes.\nBe careful. Don't get hurt, man.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Ukraine\nThe last part—to the last question, yes. When we talked about whether or not we'd—the three meetings we talked about. And we talked about: We would go from there, if there was reason to, to go to a summit. We talked about a summit as being before the Ukraine item came up in terms of strategic doctrine and what the strategic relationship would be. So I still think that is a possibility, number one.\nNumber two, I am very concerned. I'm very concerned that this could end up being—look, the only war that's worse than one that's intended is one that's unintended. And what I'm concerned about is, this could get out of hand—very easily get out of hand because of what you said: the borders of the—of Ukraine and what Russia may or may not do.\nI am hoping that Vladimir Putin understands that he is—short of a full-blown nuclear war, he's not in a very good position to dominate the world. And so I don't think he thinks that, but it is a concern. And that's why we have to be very careful about how we move forward and make it clear to him that there are prices to pay that could, in fact, cost his country an awful lot.\nBut I—of course, you have to be concerned when you have, you know, a nuclear power invade—this has—if he invades—it hasn't happened since World War II. This will be the most consequential thing that's happened in the world, in terms of war and peace, since World War II.\nYes.\nWell, the answer is, I hope the new normal will be that we don't have—still have 30-some million people not vaccinated. I hope the new normal is, people have seen—and what their own interest is and have taken advantage of what we have available to us.\nNumber two, with the pill that is probably—that appears to be as efficacious as it seems to be—that you're going to be able to deal with this virus in a way that, after the fact, you have the ability to make sure you don't get so—you don't get very sick.\nNumber three, I would hope that what happens is, the rest of the world does what I'm doing and provides significant amounts of the vaccine to the rest of the world. Because it's not sufficient that we just have this country not have the virus or be able to control the virus, but that—you can't build a wall high enough to keep a new variant out.\nSo it requires—one of the things that I want to do and we're contemplating—figuring out how to do—not—we are contemplating how to get done—and that is: How do we move in a direction where the world itself is vaccinated?\nIt's not enough just to vaccinate 340 million—fully vaccinate 340 million people in the United States. That's not enough. It's not enough to do it here. We have to do it, and we have to do a lot more than we're doing now.\nAnd that's why we have continued to keep the commitment of providing vaccines and available cures for the rest of the world as well.\nI don't believe the polls.\nWell, why don't you just go down the row there.\nBecause the science hasn't reached a point where they're convinced that, in fact, it is safe. So that's what they're doing now. You could have asked me that—I got asked that question about 3 months ago, about people between the ages of, you know, 7 and 12. Well, they finally—they've got to the point where they felt secure in the number of tests they had done and the tests they had run that it was safe.\nSo it will come. It will come. But I can't—I'm not a scientist; I can't tell you when. But it is really very important that we get to that next piece.\nThere's two really big components that I feel strongly about that I'm not sure I can get in the package: one is the childcare tax credit and the other is help for cost of community colleges. They are massive things that I've run on, I care a great deal about, and I'm going to keep coming back at in whatever fora I get to be able to try to get chunks or all of that done.\nYes, sir. Next man—next to your left.\nLatin America-U.S. Relations/Addressing the Root Causes of Migration/Democratization\nWe always have long press conferences like this. [Laughter]\nWell, I try to express—I've asked—I've tried to answer that seven different ways today about how to deal with inflation. But let me answer the first question.\nI've spent a lot of time in South America and in Latin America. When I was Vice President, I spent the bulk of my 8 years basically in Europe and/or in Latin America. I'm in contact with the leaders of the countries in South America, and we're working closely with making sure that we do everything—for example, with the—to deal with helping the countries in question, particularly those in Central America, to be able to help them with their ability to deal with the internal—people don't sit around in Guatemala and say: \"I've got a great idea: Let's sell everything we have, give the money to a coyote, take us across a terribly dangerous trip up through Central America and up through Mexico, and drop us—sneak us across the border, drop us in the desert. Won't that be fun?\"\nPeople leave because they have real problems. And one of the things that I've done, when I was a Vice President, and got support with—although I don't have much Republican support anymore—is provide billions of dollars to be able to say to those countries, \"Why are people leaving? And how are you going to reform your own system?\" And that's what we've worked on a long time. It still needs a lot more work. And we're focusing on that.\nI also believe—I've spent a lot of time talking about and dealing with policy having to do with Maduro, who is little more than a dictator right now, and the same thing in Chile and—not the same thing, but with Chile, as well as Argentina.\nSo, look, I made a speech a while ago, when I was Vice President, saying that if we were smart, we have an opportunity to make the Western Hemisphere a united—not united—a democratic hemisphere. And we were moving in the right direction under our—under the last administration—the Obama-Biden administration.\nBut so much damage was done as a consequence of the foreign policy decisions the last President made in Latin America, Central America, and South America that we now have—when I call for a Summit of the Democracies—I called that, and a number of nations showed up for this Summit of Democracy—what is it that's going to allow us to generate—we've actually had a reduction in the number of democracies in the world. And it seems to me there's nothing more important.\nWe used to talk about, when I was a kid in college, about \"America's backyard.\" It's not America's backyard. Everything south of the Mexican border is America's front yard. And we're equal people. We don't dictate what happens in any other part of that—of this continent or the South American continent. We have to work very hard on it.\nBut the trouble is, we're having great difficulty making up for the mistakes that were made the last 4 years, and it's going to take some time.\nAnytime you have an extra 3 hours, we can do it. [Laughter]\nWell, first of all, they weren't nearly as obstructionist as they are now, number one. They stated that, but you had a number of Republicans we worked with closely, from John McCain—I mean, a number of Republicans we worked closely with. Even, back in those days, Lindsey Graham.\nAnd so the difference here is, there seems to be a desire to work—and I didn't say \"my\" agenda; I'm saying, what are they for? What—what is their agenda? They had an agenda back in the administration when—the 8 years we were President and Vice President, but I don't know what their agenda is now. What is it?\nThe American public is outraged about the tax structure we have in America. What are they proposing to do about it? Anything? Have you heard anything? I mean, anything. I haven't heard anything.\nThe American public is outraged about the fact that we're the—the state of the environment—the vast majority of the public. What have they done to do anything to ameliorate the climate change that's occurring, other than to deny it exists?\nSo what I'm saying is, the difference between then and now is not only the announcement that was made: \"Anything to stop Barack Obama.\" I get that part. But what eventually happened? We were able to get some things done. We were able to work through some things. On the stuff that was really consequential, in terms of ideologically divisive, it was a real fight.\nBut so—but I don't think there's a time when I—I mean, I wonder what would be the Republican platform right now. What do you think? What do you think their position on taxes are? What do you think their position on human rights is? What do you think their position is on whether or not we should—on what we should do about the cost of prescription drugs? What do you think?\nI mean, I just—I, honest to God, don't know what they're for, yet I know a lot of these Senators and Congressmen, and I know they do have things they want to support, whether they're things I want or not. But you don't hear much about that.\nAnd every once in a while, when you hear something where there's a consensus—it's important, but a small item, and it doesn't get much coverage at all where it occurs. I'm not meaning \"coverage.\" I mean, there's not much discussion about it.\nSo I just think it's a different—and I don't know that no matter how strongly one supports, as a Republican, and/or supports the President—the former President of the United States—I don't know how we can't look at what happened on January 6 and think: \"That's a problem. That's a real problem.\"\nBy the way, it's a quarter of, guys, so I'm going to do this—just let's—if you manage to make easy questions, then I'll give you quick answers.\nWhat do you mean \"allowing\"? I'm confused by the question. I'm sorry.\nOh, I think it could be, but I hope to God that they're—that—look, maybe I'm kidding myself, but as time goes on, the voter who is just trying to figure out, as I said, how to take care of their family, put three squares on the table, stay safe, able to pay their mortgage or their rent, et cetera, has—is becoming much more informed on the motives of some of the political players and some of the—and the political parties. And I think that they are not going to be as susceptible to believing some of the outlandish things that have been said and continue to be said.\nYou know, every—every President, not necessarily in the first 12 months, but every President in the first couple of years—almost every President, excuse me, of the last Presidents—at least four of them—have had polling numbers that are 44 percent favorable.\nSo it's this idea that—but you all—not you all—but now it is, \"Well, Biden is at—one poll showed him at 33 percent. The average is 44—44, 45 percent. One poll had him at 49 percent.\" I mean, the idea that—the American public are trying to sift their way through what's real and what's fake. And I don't think as—I've never seen a time when the political coverage—the choice of what political coverage a voter looks to has as much impact on as what they believe; they go to get reinforced in their views, whether it's MSNBC or whether it's Fox or whatever.\nI mean—and one of the things I find fascinating that's happening—and you all are dealing with it every day—and it will impact on how things move—is that a lot of the speculation in the polling data shows that the—that the cables are heading south; they're losing viewership. You know? Well, Fox is okay for a while, but it's not gated. And a lot of the rest are predicted to be not very much in the mix in the next 4 to 5 years. I don't know whether that's true or not.\nBut I do know that we have sort of put everybody in—put themselves in certain alleys. And they've decided that, you know, how many people who watch MSNBC also watch Fox, other than a politician trying to find out what's going on in both places? How many people—again, I'm no expert in any of this. But the fact is, I think you have to acknowledge that what gets covered now is necessarily a little bit different than what gets covered in the past.\nI've had a couple—well, I shouldn't get into this.\nBut the nature not—the nature of the way things get covered—and this is my observation over the years I've been involved in public life—changed. And it's changed because of everything from a thing called the internet. It's changed because of the way in which we have self-identified perspectives based on what channel you turn on, what—what network you look at—not network, but what cable you look at. And it's never quite been like that.\nAnd then I'll go to you.\nYou mean, I can still stand? It's amazing.\nWell, first of all, the messages, to the extent they've been confusing, is because the scientists—they're learning more. They're learning more about what's needed and what's not needed. And so the fact is that the one piece that has gotten a lot of attention is the communications capacity of the CDC. Well, she came along and said, \"Look, I'm not a\"—I mean, \"I'm a scientist. And I'm learning. I'm learning how to deal with stating what is the case that we've observed.\"\nBut look, I think that it's a little bit like saying—when we went through the whole issue of how to deal with polio and the polio shots, what was said in the beginning was: \"Oh, no, it's changed a little bit. We moved this way and that way.\" Or when we dealt with anything else.\nI mean, it's—this was a brandnew virus, a brandnew phenomenon. Some of it was deadly, otherwise more communicable. This is this is an unfolding story. It's the nature of the way diseases spread. We're going to learn about it in a lot of other areas, not just COVID-19.\nAnd so I think—you know, I look at it this way: Think about how astounding it was within the timeframe that it took to be able to come up with a vaccine. You used to write about that. Pretty amazing how rapidly they came up with a vaccine that saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\nDid everything get right? No.\nAnd by the way, the idea whether we—anyway. I'm talking too much.\nYes, ma'am.\nYes, I'm happy to speak out. I've—I've met with—I've talked to Mitt on other occasions. And by the way, I reached out to the minority leader as well at the time that he made his speech. And so I have no reluctance to reach out to any Republican and anyone who—and I've made it clear.\nLook, I've now had the opportunity to travel because of funerals and eulogies I've made and attended—and Congressmen and Senators who have come along with me. I don't—don't hold me to the number, but somewhere between 20 and 25 Senators and Congresspersons have traveled with me.\nAnd I find—you should get the list of them and ask what—how we, you know, sat for the 2, 3, 4, 5 hours that we've flown together—sit back in the—in that conference table and talk to them, ask them questions; they ask me questions. I learned a heck of a lot. But as President, you don't quite have that ability to do that as often as I'd like to be able to do it.\nAnd one of the things that I do think that has been made clear to me—speaking of polling—is the public doesn't want me to be the \"President Senator.\" They want me to be the President and let Senators be Senators.\nAnd so, if I've made—and I've made many mistakes, I'm sure. If I made a mistake, I'm used to negotiating to get things done, and I've been, in the past, relatively successful at it in the United States Senate, even as Vice President. But I think that role as President is a different role.\nFolks, it is now almost 6. With all due respect, I'm going to see you at the next conference. Okay? Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1269"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany", "Date": "2022-02-07", "Text": "Please, sit down. Thank you. Good afternoon.\nI'd like to start by thanking Chancellor Scholz for making this visit to Washington. We had an opportunity to have a very productive meeting. I think our staffs wondered whether we were going to let them in at all. We spent the first half-hour or more talking together, and it's been a very, very useful meeting.\nOne of the things that struck me was the shared values and—that shape how each of us approaches leadership, among them the foundational commitment to the dignity of workers and the need to treat all people with respect.\nSo I enjoyed speaking with you, Olaf. And I know, working together, we'll continue to strengthen and deepen our alliance and the extensive partnership between Germany and the United States.\nOf course, at the top of our agenda today was our united approach to deterring Russia's threats against Ukraine and the longstanding principles of rule-based international order. That's what we spent most of our time talking about.\nGermany and the United States, together with our allies and partners, are working closely together to pursue diplomatic resolutions of this situation. And diplomacy is the very best way forward for all sides, we both agree, including best for Russia, in our view. And we have made it very clear, we're ready to continue talks in good faith with Russia.\nGermany has also been a leader in pushing deescalation of tensions and encouraging dialogue through the Normandy Format. But if Russia makes the choice to further invade Ukraine, we are jointly ready, and all of NATO is ready.\nToday the Chancellor and I discussed our close cooperation and developed a strong package of sanctions that are going to clearly demonstrate international resolve and impose swift and severe consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's sovereignty and its territorial integrity.\nAnd I want to thank Germany and our—and all of our other partners in Eastern Europe—in the European Union for their work in this united effort. We are in agreement that it cannot be business as usual if Russia further invades.\nWe also discussed our shared commitment to NATO's article 5 responsibilities and reassurance of our eastern flank allies. We're united in that as well. Already, the United States is sending troops to reinforce the alliance, and I want to thank the Chancellor of Germany for hosting additional U.S. forces and for the longstanding hospitality to our women and men in uniform.\nWe also discussed the challenges we're facing to the international order from China, along with Russia and other competitors that are pursuing more illiberal futures. We've agreed that Germany and the United States will continue to work together to ensure that the rules and principles governing emerging technologies are geared to advance freedom of opportunity, not repression or authoritarianism.\nWe also reaffirmed our commitment to completing the work of integrating the Western Balkans into the European institutions and to finally realize a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace.\nWith Germany holding the Presidency of the G-7, we also talked about how that form can harness the world's leading democracies to advance a robust agenda of global—on global challenges, from ending the pandemic to addressing climate change.\nSo the bottom line is this: Whether as allies in NATO, partners through the European Union, as leaders of the G-7 and G-20, or through our strong bilateral relationship, Germany and the United States are close friends and reliable partners, and we can count on one another.\nThere is no issue of global importance where Germany and the United States are not working together, strength to strength, and applying and amplifying our efforts together.\nSo I want to thank you, Olaf, for making the journey today. And I look forward to being the first of many opportunities we can spend together, beginning this meeting and throughout the rest of the year and the rest of our terms.\nSo thank you, and welcome. The floor is yours, sir.\nThank you very much. We'll now take a couple questions each.\nThe first question first. If Germany—if Russia invades—that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again—then there will be—we—there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2. We will bring an end to it.\nWe will—I promise you, we'll be able to do it.\nYou can recognize someone now, Chancellor.\nThere's no need to win back trust. He has the complete trust of the United States. Germany is our—one of our most important allies in the world. There is no doubt about Germany's partnership with the United States. None.\nWith regard to helping Ukraine, one of the largest contributors financially to Ukraine has been Germany. Germany has been in the forefront of making sure—providing economic assistance.\nYou also asked the question—you asked so many, I can't remember them all. But in terms of the U.S. media saying Germany is not reliable, Germany is completely reliable—completely, totally, thoroughly reliable. I have no doubt about Germany at all.\nLook, there is no doubt in America's mind that Germany is an incredibly reliable ally and one of the leading physical powers in NATO, number one.\nNumber two, the notion that Nord Stream 2 would go forward with an invasion by the Russians, it's just not going to happen.\nNow, Wall Street Journal, Sabrina [Sabrina Siddiqui].\nPresident Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/U.S. Citizens in Ukraine\nWell, I've had discussions—numerous discussions with the—with the Russians and particularly with Putin. I don't know that he's even made a—I don't know that he knows what he's going to do. And I think he has to realize that it would be a gigantic mistake for him to move on Ukraine. The impact on Europe and the rest of the world would be devastating, and he would pay a heavy price.\nI have been very, very straightforward and blunt with President Putin, both on the phone and in person. We will impose the most severe sanctions that have ever been imposed—economic sanctions—and there'll be a lot to pay for that down the road.\nIt will affect others as well. It will affect us somewhat. It will affect Europeans. But it will have profound impact on his economy.\nAnd I—but I don't know. I know that he's in a position now to be able to invade almost—assuming that the ground is frozen above Kiev. He has the capacity to do that. What he's going to do, I don't know. And I don't think anybody knows but him.\nI think it'd be wise to leave the country. Not—I don't mean our—I don't mean—I'm not talking about our diplomatic corps; I'm talking about Americans who are there. I'd hate to see them get caught in a crossfire if in fact they did invade. And there's no need for that. And I—if I were they—if I had anyone there, I'd say leave.\nLet me respond. First of all, we are looking at opportunities to make up for lost gas—LNG—from Russia. We're underway of trying to see what we can do to do that and dealing with our friends around the world, as well. We think we could make up a significant portion of it that would be lost.\nBut you know, what everybody forgets here is, Russia needs to be able to sell that gas and sell that oil. Russia relies—a significant part of Russia's budget—it's the only thing they really have to export. And if in fact it's cut off, then they're going to be hurt very badly as well. And it's of consequence to them as well. This is not just a one-way street.\nAnd so we are looking at what we could do to help compensate for loss of—immediate loss of gas in Europe if it occurs. And that's what we've been working on for some time now.\nThank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nYes.\nThe answer is \"yes.\"", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-chancellor-olaf-scholz-germany"}
{"Title": "Interview with Lester Holt of NBC News in Culpeper, Virginia", "Date": "2022-02-10", "Text": "Well, it's hard to say whether they're wrong. Here's -- the science is saying now that masks work, masks make a difference, and there's a relationship. I think there's only one governor drawing back immediately, and most of them are somewhere in February -- I mean, the end of February, March, April, they're set a time limit. And I assume it has something to do with whether the omicron variant continues to dive fewer and fewer cases and because there is a relationship between the number of cases you have in your community and the need for wear masks.\nOh, I do. Omicron and the variants -- all the variants have had a profound impact on the psyche of the American people. I mean, they have -- they've had a profound impact. For example, think of all the kids who didn't get to go to a prom, all those graduations that didn't occur, all the things that -- I mean, it's had a real psychological impact.\nWell, look, when I got into the office, only 46% of the schools were open. Now, 98% of them are open, and they're wearing masks. What's happening is every day that goes by, children are more protected. We're now on -- on the verge of being able to have shots for children under the age of seven and young children. And -- and so, the more protection they have, probably you're going to see less and less requirement to have the masks.\nWell, look, I think it's one thing to say -- to talk about masks other than to talk about shots and boosters and the like. And -- but it's -- you know, look, it is confusing. It's worrisome to people. They're trying to figure out. But what I've tried to do, I've tried to make sure we have all the vaccines needed, all the boosters needed, all the masks we needed, all the protection that's needed.\nWell, you know, it's -- I've -- I committed that I would follow the science, the science as put forward by the CDC and the -- and the -- and the federal people. And I think it's probably premature, but it's -- you know, it's -- it's a tough call.\nWell, look, I've spoken with Putin. I've spoken with every NATO leader. I brought them together like, I think, they've never been as coordinated in modern history, NATO leaders, about what to do if Putin moves. The question is he knows -- he has to know that if he does, the entire circumstance for Russia changes worldwide, changes overnight. The cost to Russia, both in terms of reputational cost and economic cost, would be profound.\nThere's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been in.\nNo. How do you do that? How do you even find them? This is not like -- I'm hoping that if, in fact, he's foolish enough to go in, he's smart enough not to, in fact, do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens.\nYes.\nWell, I -- I didn't have to tell him that. He -- I've -- I've spoken about that. He knows that. And, you know, it's a little bit -- look, that's what -- what I've asked is American citizens should leave, should leave now. We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. This is a very different situation, and things could go crazy quickly.\nNo. No, that's not what I was told.\nNo, what I was told -- no one told me that -- look, there was no good time to get out. But if we had not gotten out, they acknowledged that we would have had to put a hell of a lot more troops back in. It wasn't just 2,000, 4,000. We would have to significantly increase the number of troops. And we're back in this -- this war of attrition. And -- and -- and there was no way we were ever going to unite Ukraine. I mean, it's going to be -- or Iraq -- Afghanistan. No way that was going to happen. And so, this is a much wiser thing to do.\nYes, I am.\nI'm rejecting them.\nWell, you're being a wise guy with me a little bit, and I understand that's your job. But look, at the time, what happened was the -- let's look at the reason for the inflations. The reason for the inflation is the supply chains were cut off, meaning that the products, for example, automobiles, the lack of computer chips to be able to build those automobiles so they could function. They need those computer chips. They were not available. So, what happens? The number of cars were reduced, the new cars reduced. It made up, at one point, one-third the cost of inflation because the price of automobiles were up. So, what I did when I went out, I made sure we started to make those domestically.\nAccording to Nobel laureates, 14 of them that contacted me, and a number of corporate leaders, it's ought to be able to start to taper off as we go through this year. In the meantime, I'm going to do everything in my power to deal with the big points that are -- are impacting most people in their homes.\nWell, I don't think anything has changed, it's that people are now realizing what is in Build Back Better. You know, for example, there's cancer drugs that we have here in the United States that cost 14 bucks -- $14,000 a month. In France, the same exact manufacturer, the same exact drug cost $7,000.\nYes. Yeah, I think it was.\nNo, I -- I think I haven't sold it well. I like the way you phrase things. I haven't sold it well, but the point is we've moved the economy more than it's ever been moved.\nYes. Yeah, I think it was.\nNo, I -- I think I haven't sold it well. I like the way you phrase things. I haven't sold it well, but the point is we've moved the economy more than it's ever been moved.\nWell, first of all, the shortlist are nominees who are incredibly well qualified and documented.\nWell, what I've done is I've taken about four people and done the deep dive on them, meaning this thorough background checks, and see if there's anything in the background that would make them not qualified.\nWell, I -- I think whomever I think will get a vote from the Republican side for the following reason. I'm not looking to make an ideological choice. I'm looking for someone to replace Judge Breyer with the same kind of capacity Judge Breyer have, with an open mind, who understands the Constitution, interprets it in a way that is consistent with the mainstream interpretation of the Constitution.\nWell, look, I love how people talk about personal freedom. If you're exercising personal freedom -- freedom, put someone else in jeopardy, their health in jeopardy, I don't consider that being very -- dealing with freedom. It's about moving in a direction you know is likely to diminish the prospects that this virus continues to spread. And so, I -- I think people should get the shots. We know the shots work. We know they work for the kind -- for the -- the variants that are available or that we are dealing with now. We know we have so many more tools at our disposal to prevent death and prevent serious illness. And I -- I just think they should be careful. And if they're not careful for themselves, at least think of their children, think of their, you know, their families.\nWell, I think it should be held to a reasonable standard. And, you know, the commissioner pointed out, they haven't lived up to what they committed to and lived up to being open about hiring more minorities to run teams. And whether or not -- you know, Goodell says they're going to take a look at what -- whether they can meet the standard. And the standard was set by, you know, someone who said this is something we should do. Think about it. It's -- I think it's -- the whole idea that a league that is made up of so many athletes of color, as well as so diverse, that there's not enough African American qualified coaches to \"to manage\" these NFL teams, it just seems to me that it's a standard that -- that they want to live up to. I don't know. It's not a requirement of law, but it is a requirement, I think, of some just generic decency.\nWell, my teams are out. And I -- I love this young quarterback from Cincinnati. He's an Ohio boy, can make everybody happy. But we also have some -- you know, I think Los Angeles is going to be hard to beat.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lester-holt-nbc-news-culpeper-virginia"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Brussels, Belgium", "Date": "2022-03-24", "Text": "Good evening, everyone. With all the press that's here, you must be getting very tired. Am I the 16th or 17th? [Laughter] At any rate, all kidding aside, thank you for taking the time.\nI—today marks one month since Russia began its carnage in Ukraine, the brutal invasion of Ukraine. And we held a NATO summit the very next day. At that time, my overwhelming objective, wanting that summit, was to have absolute unity on three key important issues among our NATO and European allies.\nFirst was to support Ukraine with military and humanitarian assistance. Second was to impose the most significant—the most significant sanctions—economic sanction regime ever, in order to cripple Putin's economy and punish him for his actions. Third was to fortify the eastern flank of our NATO allies, who were obviously very, very concerned and somewhat at—worried at what would happen. We accomplished all three of these. And today, we're determined to sustain those efforts and to build on them.\nThe United States has committed to provide over $2 billion in military equipment to Ukraine since I became President: anti-air systems, anti-armor systems, ammunition. And our weapons are flowing into Ukraine as I speak. And today I'm announcing the United States have prepared to commit more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to help get relief to millions of Ukrainians affected by the war in Ukraine.\nMany Ukrainian refugees will wish to stay in Europe, closer to their homes. But we've also—will welcome 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States with a focus on reuniting families. And we will invest $320 million to bolster democratic resilience and defend human rights in Ukraine and neighboring countries. We're also coordinating with the G-7 and the European Union on food security, as well as energy security, and I'll have more to say about that tomorrow.\nWe're also announcing new sanctions of more than 400 individuals and entities aligned with—in alignment with the European Union: more than 300 members of the Duma, oligarchs, and Russian defense companies that fuel the Russian war machine.\nIn addition to the 100,000 U.S. Forces now stationed in Europe to defend NATO territory, NATO established, as you already know, four new battle groups in Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Slovakia to reinforce the eastern front. Putin was banking on NATO being split. In my early conversation with him in December and early January, it was clear to me he didn't think we could sustain this cohesion.\nNATO has never, never been more united than it is today. Putin is getting exactly the opposite of what he intended to have as a consequence of going into Ukraine. We built that same unity with our European—the European Union and with the leading democracies of the G-7—in the G-7.\nSo I want to thank you, and I'll be now happy to take your questions. Since there's so many people out there, I'm going to—I've been given a list.\nNow, how about Chris [Chris Megerian] with the Associated Press? First question.\nYou know, on the first question, I can't answer that. I'm not going to give you intelligence data, number one. Number two, we would respond. We would respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use.\nJosh [Josh Wingrove] of Bloomberg.\nIf I had your voice, I'd have been elected a lot earlier. [Laughter]\n[At this point, a microphone boom was extended toward Mr. Wingrove.]\nOn the first question relating to President Xi Jinping of China, I had a very straightforward conversation with Xi, now, I guess, it's 6 days ago, 7 days ago, in that range. And I made it clear to him—I made no threats, but I made it clear to him that—make sure he understood the consequences of him helping Russia, as had been reported and as what was expected.\nAnd I made no threats, but I pointed out the number of American and foreign corporations that left Russia as a consequence of their barbaric behavior. And I indicated that I knew how much he—because we had long discussions in the past about his interest in making sure he has economic relations and economic growth with Europe and the United States—and indicated that he'd be putting himself in significant jeopardy and those—in those aims if in fact he were to move forward.\nI am not going to comment on any detail about what we know or don't know as a consequence of that conversation. But tomorrow is—is it tomorrow or next Monday that Ursula is having that conference with China?\nWhite House aides.April 1.\nThe 1st—on April 1.\nWe've had discussions—because I think that China understands that its economic future is much more closely tied to the West than it is to Russia. And so I'm hopeful that he does not get engaged.\nWe also did discuss today that there's a need for us to set up, NATO to set up, and the EU—to set up a system whereby we have an organization looking at who has violated any of the sanctions and where and when and how they violated them. And that's something we're going to put in train. It's not done yet.\nSo, with regard to Xi, I have nothing more to report.\nWith regard to food shortage, yes, we did talk about food shortages. And it's going to be real. The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia, it's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well. And—because both Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat, for example—just to give you one example.\nBut we had a long discussion in the G-7 with the—with both the United States, which has a significant—the third largest producer of wheat in the world—as well as Canada, which is also a major, major producer. And we both talked about how we could increase and disseminate more rapidly—food shortages.\nAnd in addition to that, we talked about urging all the European countries and everyone else to end trade restrictions on sending—limitations on sending food abroad. And so we are in the process of working out, with our European friends, what it would be—what it would take to help alleviate the concerns relative to food shortages.\nWe also talked about a significant, major U.S. investment, among others, in terms of providing for—the need for humanitarian assistance, including food, as we move forward.\nTarini [Tarini Parti] of the Wall Street Journal. Watch out you don't get hit in the head there now. [Laughter]\nOn the latter point, my answer is yes. That depends on the G-20. I—that was raised today. And I raised the possibility, if that can't be done—if Indonesia and others do not agree—then we should, in my view, ask to have both Ukraine be able to attend the meetings, as well as—well, basically, Ukraine being able to attend the G-20 meeting and observe.\nWith regard to—what was the first question?\nThat is a total judgment based on Ukraine. \"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" I don't believe that they're going to have to do that, but that's a judgment. There's negotiations—that are discussions, I should say—that have taken place that I have not been part of, including Ukrainians. And it's their judgment to make.\nCecilia [Cecilia Vega], ABC. There you are.\nNo and no.\nIt would trigger a response in kind, whether or not—you're asking whether NATO would cross; we'd make that decision at the time.\nI don't think so, because I've been to many, many war zones. I've been in refugee camps. I've been in war zones for the last 15 years. And it's devastating. And what—the thing you look at the most is you see these young children, you see children without parents that are in those camps or in—or refugees. You see women and husbands—men and women who are completely lost and have no—you see the look—that blank look on their face, that absolute feeling of: \"My God, where am I? What's going to happen to me?\"\nAnd so it—what it will do, it will reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.\nFor example, this is not something that Poland or Romania or Germany should carry on their own. This is an international responsibility. And the United States, as the leader—one of the leaders in the international community, has an obligation to be engaged—to be engaged and do all we can to ease the suffering and pain of innocent women and children, and men, for that matter, throughout Ukraine and those who have made it across the border.\nI plan on attempting to see those folks, as well as I hope I'm going to be able to see—I guess I'm not supposed to say where I'm going, am I? [Laughter] But anyway, I hope I get to see a lot of people. [Laughter]\nMarkus [Markus Becker] with Der Spiegel.\nUpcoming Presidential and Congressional Elections/Impact of Elections on the President's Policies/U.S. Credibility in Global Affairs\nYou're kidding.\nNo, I—that's not how I think of this. I've been dealing with foreign policy for longer than anybody that's involved in this process right now. I have no concerns about the impact—I made a commitment when I ran this time. I wasn't going to run again, and I mean that sincerely.\nI had no intention of running for President again and—until I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Virginia carrying torches and carrying Nazi banners and literally singing the same vile rhyme that they used in Germany in the early twenties—or thirties, I should say. And then, when the gentleman you mentioned was asked what he thought—and a young woman was killed, a protester—and he asked—was asked what he thought, he said, \"There are very good people on both sides.\" And that's when I decided I wasn't going to be quiet any longer.\nAnd when I ran this time—and I think the American press, whether they look at me favorably or unfavorably, acknowledge this—I made a determination: Nothing is worth—no election is worth my not doing exactly what I think is the right thing. Not a joke. I'm too long in the tooth to fool with this any longer.\nAnd so we're a long way off in elections—a long way off. My focus of any election is on making sure that we retain the House and the United States Senate so that I have the room to continue to do the things that I've been able to do in terms of grow the economy and deal in a rational way with American foreign policy and lead the world—lead the—be the leader of the free world.\nSo—but it's not a—it's not an illogical question for someone to ask. I say to people at home: Imagine if we sat and watched the doors of the Bundestag broken down and police officers killed and hundreds of people storming in, or imagine if we saw that happening in the British Parliament or whatever. How would we feel?\nAnd one of the things that I take some solace from is, I don't think you'll find any European leader who thinks that I am not up to the job. And I mean that sincerely. It's not like, \"Whoa.\" It's that—the point is that when—the first G-7 meeting I attended, like the one I did today, was in Great Britain. And I sat down, and I said, \"America is back.\" And one of the—one of my counterparts, colleagues, a head of state, said, \"For how long?\" \"For how long?\"\nAnd so I don't blame—I don't criticize anybody for asking that question. But the next election, I'd be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.\nThank you very, very much.\n[Laughter] Whoa, whoa, whoa. No—yes, one final question. Right.\nHey, well, wait—hold on a second, please. I was supposed to be, an hour ago, at the European Union meeting and—to speak.\nNo, I'm thanking you. [Laughter]\nSomeone I haven't called on before. You.\nWho are you?\nOkay.\nInternational and U.S. Sanctions on Russia/Ukraine/Importance of Unity With Allies\nLet's get something straight: You remember, if you've covered me from the beginning, I did not say that in fact the sanctions would deter him. Sanctions never deter. You keep talking about that.\nSanctions never deter. The maintenance of sanctions—the maintenance of sanctions—the increasing the pain, and the demonstration—why I asked for this NATO meeting today—is to be sure that after a month, we will sustain what we're doing not just next month, the following month, but for the remainder of this entire year. That's what will stop him.\nThat's not what I said. You—you're playing a game with me.\nI know. The answer is no.\nI think what happens is, we have to demonstrate—the purpose—the single most important thing is for us to stay unified, and the world continue to focus on what a brute this guy is and all the innocent people's lives that are being lost and ruined, and what's going on. That's the important thing.\nBut look, if you're Putin and you think that the—that Europe is going to crack in a month, 6 weeks or 2 months, why not—they can take anything for another month. But we have to demonstrate—the reason I asked for the meeting—we have to stay fully, totally, thoroughly united.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-brussels-belgium-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore", "Date": "2022-03-29", "Text": "Welcome back to the White House. I'm honored to welcome Prime Minister Lee to the White House today. And I'm proud—and I mean this sincerely—I'm really proud of the partnership that—between Singapore and the United States. It's as close and as strong as it's ever been. And together, we're working to uphold a rules-based order—international order, supporting the founding principles of the United Nations—and advance a future for the Indo-Pacific that is both free and open.\nAs we look toward the future, Prime Minister Lee and I share a commitment to ASEAN as—and its centrality in all of what we do. And I'm looking forward to hosting the ASEAN leaders here in Washington, DC, for a special summit this spring.\nWe also discussed a wide range of concerns for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. That includes ensuring that all nations in the region, including China, uphold the principles that enable a free and open region. Singapore and the United States are both committed to freedom of navigation as well as the unimpeded flow of maritime commerce in the South China Sea.\nWe shared our concerns about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and their destabilizing ballistic missile launches and in clear violation—which are clearly in violation of multiple U.N. Council resolutions—Security Council resolutions. And we both urge North Korea to refrain from further provocations and return to the negotiation table for serious and sustained diplomacy.\nWe're deeply concerned, both of us, by the continuing suffering and violence in Burma, following last year's military coup, the coup that caused humanitarian crisis and reversed a decade of democratic and economic progress for the people of Burma. Singapore and the United States agree that the military regime must urgently implement the ASEAN five-point consensus and return Burma to its path to democratic transition.\nAnd we also discussed the war in Ukraine. Last week, in Europe, the world saw the strong unity for a unified response and resolve among the NATO alliance, the G-7, and the European Union to answer Putin's brutal and unjustified assault on Ukraine.\nToday, with the Prime Minister's visit and Singapore's strong leadership on this issue, it's clear that Putin's war is unacceptable to nations in every region of the world—not just Europe, but in every region of the world. It's an attack on the core international principles, and it—that underpin peace and security and prosperity everywhere, including in the Indo-Pacific.\nToday, Singapore and the United States are united in sending the message to all nations—to all nations, regardless of their size or population: They are equal in the right—in their rights on the global stage. They have a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity and to determine their own future free from violence and intimidation.\nThank you. Now, we each agreed we would take one question. And—I'll—as I'll recognize someone first.\nDarlene Superville, Associated Press.\nWe'll see. I don't read anything into it until I see what their actions are. We'll see if they follow through on what they're suggesting. There are negotiations that have begun today—or not begun, continued; today: one in Turkey and others.\nI had a meeting with the heads of state of four allies in NATO: France, Germany, the United States, and Great Britain. And there seems to be a consensus that let's just see what they have to offer; we'll find out what they do. But in the meantime, we're going to continue to keep strong the sanctions. We're going to continue to provide the Ukrainian military with their capacity to defend themselves. And we're going to continue to keep a close eye on what's going on.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nThank you, gentlemen.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-singapore-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea in Seoul, South Korea", "Date": "2022-05-21", "Text": "Thank you for all the time that you gave me today, particularly our private conversations and the incredible hospitality and welcome we've received. I'm honored to be able to be—to meet you so early in your tenure, and it's a pleasure to get to know—get to know you personally.\nI'm delighted to be back in your beautiful country and at a time when the alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States has never been stronger, more vibrant, or, I might add, more vital. And I believe that this trip is coming at a particularly interesting moment, because we're seeing so many expectations in Asia and in the broader Indo-Pacific region being updated. I'm looking forward to it even occurring more.\nMy administration is pursuing an economic strategy designed to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, and it's paying dividends. Even in the face of historic economic challenges, our economy is providing and proving to be resilient. In fact, just yesterday an independent analysis projected that the American economy is poised to grow at a faster rate than China—than the Chinese economy—for the first time in 45 years, since 1976.\nAnd our relationship with our allies—including, I'm proud to say, the Republic of Korea—are closer than they've ever been. And our people are growing even closer as we speak. Our businesses are blazing new trails together. And it all goes to my core belief, something I've said for a long time: It's never a good bet to bet against the United States of America.\nWe're a nation that is all about one thing: possibilities. Endless possibilities. And that optimism is a commitment and—commitment to an innovation where breaking barriers is something that Koreans and Americans share.\nYesterday the President and I visited a factory where Korean and American innovation are working in tandem to produce the most advanced semiconductors in the world. And I welcome the billions of dollars of investment that Korean companies like Samsung are making in the United States, investments that will bring our two countries even closer together, cooperating even more closely than we already do, and help strengthen our supply chains, secure them against shocks, and give our economies a competitive edge.\nToday President Yoon and I discussed the broad range of issues, as he's mentioned today—I apologize for repeating him—on both regional and global terms. The cooperation between the Republic in [of]* Korea and the United States is vital to our shared strategic progress; at least, we both believe that.\nFrom fighting this pandemic to strengthening global health security, health systems, and so that we can better be prepared for the next major global health event—and there will be others; from increasing our climate ambitions to accelerating climate solutions, like development of electric vehicles; from standing up to our shared—for our shared democratic values and defending a rule-based international order against threats in stability, our alliance is making important contributions to shape the future for our children. And Korea's strong and its dynamic economy is a powerful example of that for the rest of the world.\nI also want to thank the peoples of Korea for their strong support for the people of Ukraine. Putin's war against Ukraine isn't just a matter for Europe, it's an attack on democracy and the core international principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nAnd the Republic of Korea and the United States are standing together—part of a global response with our allies and partners around the world—to condemn Russia's flagrant violations of international law and to hold Russia accountable and to support the people of Ukraine.\nTomorrow the President and I will be visiting with the Korean and American troops who are still serving side by side even today, decades after our troops first fought valiantly together, to preserve the freedom of the Republic of Korea. It's emblematic of our strength and our continuing strength and of the durability of our alliance and our readiness to take on all threats together.\nAnd today President Yoon and I committed to strengthening our close engagement and work together to take on challenges of regional security, including addressing the threat posed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by further strengthening our deterrence posture and working toward a complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, as the President has already spoken to; promoting stability across the Taiwan Straits as well; and ensuring freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea and beyond.\nSo thank you again, Mr. President, for your warm welcome, for your commitment to strengthening our alliance, and for expanding our global partnership. I look forward to years to come.\nNow, I believe—who asks the first question?\nTrevor Hunnicutt [Reuters].\nWould you like me to go first?\nThe answer with regard to would I meet—would I provide vaccines for North Korea and would I prepare to meet: The answer is yes. We've offered vaccines not only to North Korea, but to China as well, and we're prepared to do that immediately. We've gotten no response.\nWith regard to whether I would meet with the leader of North Korea, that would be dependent on whether he was sincere and whether it was serious.\nWhat was the other question you asked me?\nWell, I think what you're going to see is—what we're talking about in terms of this—this arrangement we're discussing now, it's quite significant. And what we're talking about is, as it was pointed out, an economic strategy that—for the entire Indo-Pacific region. And it's working on—in critical areas in the supply chain, not just the semiconductors, but a range of other products as well.\nSemiconductors, which is—we've already discussed a little bit. Infrastructure and making sure we make available the capacity to provide modern infrastructure to many of the countries in the region who may not have the capacity.\nThree, the—a digital economy, dealing with cybersecurity standards and sharing major standards of data access, based on the boundaries within trust. And that we—that needs to be done, in our view. As well as a clean and renewable environment, clean energy technologies, a global minimum tax; the tax side of the equation, just like we recently negotiated; and deal with establishing foreign practices act—effect internationally.\nAll that is quite broad, and it is separate from and also semi-inclusive of what the TPP was about. So this is the objective that I have in mind—we have in mind at the front end here.\nSeung Min [Seung Min Kim], with the Washington Post.\nSouth Korea-Japan-U.S. Relations/Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation/Ukraine\nYou only get one. [Laughter]\nI'm protecting him. [Laughter]\nThe answer is that we discussed that in generic terms. The fact is that I'll be going from here to Tokyo and discussing this as well.\nI think it's critically important that we have a very close trilateral relationship, including economically as well as militarily. And I think you'll see that there are ways to deal with some of the trade barriers that were placed—some of which, by the way, were placed by my predecessor, which we're looking at very closely right now. So I think there's a lot of room to move.\nIn addition to that, if—you know, I think you covered the fact that I spend a lot of time with the ASEAN nations, as well as the Quartet. There's a whole range of—things have changed. There is a sense among the democracies in the Pacific that there's a need to cooperate much more closely, not just militarily, but in terms of economically and politically.\nAnd so we talked in—at some length about the need for us to make this larger than just the United States, Japan, and Korea, but to the entire Pacific and the South Pacific and the Indo-Pacific.\nAnd I think this is an opportunity. You know, you've heard me say it a hundred times—I'm sorry to the American press to repeat it—but I really do think we're at an inflection point in world history. Things are changing so rapidly. I think you're seeing that—what you're going to see more of is this is going to be competition between democracies and autocracies. And I mean that sincerely. And unfortunately, I think I'm being proven to be correct, not just here, but around the world.\nAnd again, we talked at length about—this is a—not only just regional, but it's also a global alliance, in effect, of how we're going to respond. And I don't mean a formal written alliance. But, for example, if you notice, Korea and Japan have both stepped up in support of Ukraine. You find that in—the Quad is supporting Ukraine.\nSo there's a whole range of things that affect whether or not democracies can be sustained in the midst of this incredible change that is taking place. We both agreed that it could and should be and that, together, we can play a major part in having that done.\nThank you. Appreciate it.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-seoul-south-korea"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan in Tokyo, Japan", "Date": "2022-05-23", "Text": "Thank you very much, Prime Minister, for that warm welcome you've given me here in Japan.\nIn recent years, the alliance between Japan and the United States has grown stronger, deeper, and more capable as we work together to take on the challenges—just as important as the opportunities—of a rapidly changing world.\nA great example of this: We viewed Japan's lunar rover just coming out here—over out here—before—after lunch. A symbol of how our space cooperation is taking off, looking toward the Moon and to Mars. And I'm excited—I'm excited at the work we will do together on the Gateway Station around the Moon, and I look forward to the first Japanese astronaut joining us on the mission to the lunar surface under theArtemisprogram.\nAnd tomorrow we're going to meet with the—our fellow Quad partners, Australia and India, for our fourth leaders' summit, and our second time meeting together in person. The Quad is showing the world that cooperation among democracies can get big things done, and I am grateful for your leadership. And thank you for bringing us all together again to keep driving our progress as we advance a positive vision for the future of the Indo-Pacific region.\nToday we made several commitments to further increase our bilateral cooperation and to work together to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific that creates opportunity and prosperity for all the people in the region.\nThrough our comprehensive and reliance—excuse me—and Resilience Partnership, which we announced last year, we're in a situation now that we've invested our cooperation to spur innovation while delivering concrete progress for our people: promoting a secure 5G network and improving internet connectivity for our partners in the region; improving critical infrastructure and strengthening supply chain resilience, particularly on semiconductors, batteries, and critical minerals.\nResponding to COVID-19 and building a greater health security and stronger health system is also part of the future, and helping the world prepare for the next pandemic with our new CDC regional office right here in Japan. Cooperating on clean energy and decarbonization to tackle the climate crisis.\nAnd after this, the United States and Japan, together with 11 other nations, will be launching the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. This framework is a commitment to working with our close friends and partners in the region on challenges that matter most to ensuring economic competitiveness in the 21st century: by improving security and trust in the digital economy, protecting workers, strengthening supply chains, and tackling corruption that robs nations of their ability to serve their citizens.\nYou know, as the two largest democracies, the two largest economic—economies in the democratic world, the United States and Japan, are demonstrating the strength of democracies in action. Our cooperation has been particularly vital in organizing the global response to hold Putin accountable for his brutal war in Ukraine and his attack on the norms and principles that are the foundation of our international order.\nNo.\nLook, you're talking about the significant progress we've made in making sure we don't have supply chain backups—about the 8,000 jobs that Hyundai is going to be bringing to Georgia; 3,000 jobs to Texas from Samsung, $17 billion investment; Toyota, 1,700 jobs in North Carolina on battery technology; the situation where we—at—we've created over 8 million new jobs, where unemployment is down to 3.6 percent, and so on and so forth—as if they're a problem. Imagine where we'd be with Putin's tax and the war in Ukraine had we not made that enormous progress.\nWe're—our GDP is going to grow faster than China's for the first time in 40 years. Now, does that mean we don't have problems? We do. We have problems that the rest of the world has, but less consequential than the rest of the world has them because of our internal growth and strength.\nHere's the situation. And when it comes to the gas prices, we're going through an incredible transition that is taking place that, God willing, when it's over, we'll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over.\nYou see what Europe is doing relative to the importation of Russian gas. You see what—anyway, I won't go through it all, but—and what I've been able to do to keep it from getting even worse. And it's bad. The price of gas at the pump is something that I told you—you heard me say before—it would be a matter of great discussion at my kitchen table when I was a kid growing up. It's affecting a lot of families.\nBut we have released over two hundred and, I think, fifty-seven thousand—million barrels of oil, I should say. Us and the rest of the world we convinced to get involved. It's helped, but it's not been enough.\nAnd we also find ourselves in a situation where we have food shortages, food shortages because of Ukraine. There are over—there are literally millions of bushels of oil—I mean, excuse me, of grain being held up in Ukraine that would fundamentally impact positively on the market in terms of bringing down food prices across the board.\nSo we're finding ourselves in a position where we're working very hard with American farmers and American manufacturing—and American agricultural products to provide more fertilizer and a whole range of things.\nThis is going to be a haul. This is going to take some time. But in the meantime, it seems to me the best thing I can do—in addition to try to get the Middle Eastern countries, including OPEC, to raise their production of oil and move along that route—is to see to it that we continue to grow our economy, create jobs.\nAnd the other thing is, there's a second wave—I know you don't want to talk about it—not necessarily you; people don't want to talk about it right now. And I won't take up the time. But there's a second wave to impact on inflation, in terms of people's daily cost.\nIf you're able to have childcare at 17 percent of—7 percent of your income, if you're able to be in a position where we were able to provide for a tax cut for middle class people and working class people, et cetera—all those things would be very helpful.\nAnd we—but when we have a 50/50 Senate, it means we have 50 \"presidents.\" And I'm having a little trouble getting some of these things passed. But we're not going to give up. We're going to keep pushing.\nChina-U.S. Trade\nI'm talking with the Secretary when we get home. I am considering it. We did not impose any of those tariffs. They were imposed by the last administration, and they're under consideration.\nThank you.\nNancy Cordes, with NBC—CBS. Hey, Nance.\n[At this point, the reporter approached the microphone.]\nDangerous. [Laughter]\nNo, I don't think so. Look, we've had this monkeypox in the larger numbers in the past, number one. Number two, we have vaccines to care for it—to take care of it. Number three, there is—thus far, there doesn't seem to be a need for any kind of extra efforts beyond what's going on. And so I just don't think it rises to the level of the kind of concern that existed with COVID-19 or—and the smallpox vaccine works for it. So—but I think people should be careful.\nI think we do have enough to deal with the likelihood of the problem.\nOur policy toward Taiwan has not—Taiwan—has not changed at all. We remain committed to supporting the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and ensuring that there is no unilateral change to that status quo.\nI would add that one of the reasons why it's so important that Putin pay a dear price for his barbarism in Ukraine: The idea that on your station today and every other station in America they're showing bombings of every school—no military purpose—schools, hospitals, daycare centers, all the things, museums—blowing up all the museums. I believe what Putin is attempting to do is eliminate the identity of Ukraine—the identity. He can't occupy it, but he can try to destroy its identity.\nAnd the reason I bother to mention that is, he has to pay and Russia has to pay a long-term price for that, in terms of the sanctions that have been imposed.\nAnd the reason I bother to say this—it's not just about Ukraine: If in fact after all he's done there's a rapprochement met between China—I mean, excuse me, between the Ukrainians and Russia, and these sanctions are not continued to be sustained in many ways, then what signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting—attempting—to take Taiwan by force? They're already flirting with danger right now by flying so close and all the maneuvers they've undertaken.\nBut the United States is committed. We've made a commitment. We support the \"one China\" policy. We support all that we've done in the past, but that does not mean—it does not mean—that China has the ability—has the—excuse me, the jurisdiction to go in and use force to take over Taiwan.\nSo we stand firmly with Japan and with other nations that—not to let that happen. And my expectation is, it will not happen; it will not be attempted.\nAnd my expectation is, a lot of it depends upon just how strongly the world makes clear that that kind of action is going to result in long-term disapprobation by the rest of the community.\nYes.\nThat's the commitment we made. That's the commitment we made. We are not—look, here's the situation: We agree with the \"one China\" policy; we've signed on to it and all the attendant agreements made from there. But the idea that it can be taken by force—just taken by force—is just not a—is just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine. And so it's a burden that is even stronger.\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan-tokyo-japan"}
{"Title": "Interview with Josh Boak of the Associated Press", "Date": "2022-06-16", "Text": "Sure, happy to.\nWell, I'm making choices. It's an interesting question. I'm making choices like I always have, in the sense that circumstances change but my objective doesn't change. Does that make sense to you? For example, I have, uh, from the time I've entered public life, it's been about how to give ordinary working-class and middle-class folks a shot (inaudible) .. instead of everything being viewed as from the top down. I'm not a big, is it working (a reference to the tape recorder).\nI'm not a big believer in trickle-down economy, and, um, and so everything I look at from the time I took this office, but even before that when I was a senator all those years, is what's the best shot to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when that happens everybody does well. The wealthy do very, very well. And the biggest thing I think that, when I came into this job, that I have the greatest frustration with the last four years, is that, um, uh, everything was constructed and built and arranged in order for the top 1 to 3% of the population to do very well. The rest was sort of, I mean that literally, everything else seemed to be an afterthought.\nWell, if you notice, until gas prices started going up, which was about the same time, the University of Michigan survey, they had a very different view. Things were much more, they were much more optimistic. We came in and we started to grow the economy in significant ways. We were able to, ah, you know, go from 2 million shots in arms to 225 million. People were having access to dealing with the pandemic. We started opening up businesses, and opening up access to go back to work, etc. But then, in my experience, the way I was raised, if you want a direct barometer of what people are going to talk about at the kitchen table and the dining room table and whether things are going well, it's the cost of food and what's the cost of, of gasoline at the pump. I mean literally at the pump.\nAnd if you notice, you know, uh, gasoline went up a, you know, $1.25 right off the bat, almost, when, the, Putin's war started. Um, and as I said at the time, by the way, I made it clear with helping Ukraine, and organizing NATO to help Ukraine, that this was going to cost. There was going to be a price to pay for it. It was, this is not going to be cost-free, but we had, the option of doing nothing was worse. If he in fact moved into Ukraine, took hold of Ukraine, and Belarus, where it is, and he's been a threat to NATO, all those things would have even been more dire.\nSure.\nSure.\nI'm the president of the United States. It's not about my political survival. It's about what's best for the country. No kidding. No kidding. So what happens? What happens if the strongest power, NATO, an organizational structure we put together, walked away from Russian aggression of over 100,000 troops marching across a border to try to, to occupy and wipe out a culture of an entire people. What, then, then what happens? What happens next? What do we do next?\nOh, I fear what would happen next is you'd see chaos in Europe. You would see the possibility they continue to move. You already saw what they're doing in Belarus. What would happen in the surrounding countries. Watch what would happen in Poland, and, and the Czech Republic and all the members of NATO. For example, you know, the reason Putin said he was going to go in was because he didn't want them to join NATO. And, uh, he, he, he, he wanted the sort of the Finland-ization of NATO. He got the NATO-ization of Finland, instead. (laughter) No, I'm serious.\nAnd so, the idea that if the United States stood by, then what does China think about Taiwan? Then what does North Korea think about nuclear weapons beyond testing and pressure?\nNo, I don't. But I don't think, look, on a daily basis, most households just trying to figure out how to put, before, even when things were going well, just figure out how to put food on the table, take care of the kids, pay for their education, just basic things. You know, look, um, one of the, I've always suggested to younger people that want to get into public life, I ask them two things: Have you figured out what's worth losing over? Have you figured out what's worth losing over? If you haven't figured that out, don't get in politics. Go into a more profitable org, enterprise. Go into business, go into commerce, don't, be engaged. But unless you know what's worth losing over, don't get engaged. Number one. Number two. The purpose of public service is to promote views that you think are best for the American people.\nI made a commitment and I think I can say that I've never broken, if I make a commitment. I wasn't going to run again, this time. I mean for real. I was not going to run. I just lost my son, I was teaching at Penn, I liked it, until all those guys came, come out of the woods ...\n... the Charlottesville folks and this other guy said \"good people on both sides\" when an innocent woman was killed, etc. And, I made a decision. I've been doing this too long to do anything other than to try to do what was right. I mean, I'm not, there's nothing noble about it. But it's not worth it. So, you asked me what would I say to the American people. I'd say to the American people I've done foreign policy my whole career. I'm convinced that if we let Russia roll and Putin roll, he wouldn't stop.\nZero evidence of that. Zero evidence of that, number one. Number two, we've reduced the deficit by $350 billion last year. We reduced the deficit by a trillion, 700 billion this year. We grow the economy. Today, today, we have more people employed than, in a long, long time and we gained another 8.6 million jobs. And guess what? We still have hundreds of thousands of job openings.\nYeah, they apprised me.\nNow you just said two different things. You said Republicans said I caused inflation. She said it may have a marginal impact on it. Two different things. You could argue whether it had a marginal, minor impact on inflation. I don't think it did. And most economists do not think it did. But the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre.\nSure.\nThey shouldn't believe a warning. They should just say: \"Let's see. Let's see, which is correct.\" And from my perspective, you talked about a recession. First of all, it's not inevitable. Secondly, we're in a stronger position than any nation in the world to overcome this inflation. It's bad. Isn't it kind of interesting? If it's my fault, why is it the case in every other major industrial country in the world that inflation is higher? You ask yourself that? I'm not being a wise guy. Someone should ask themself that question. Why? Why is it? If it's a consequence of our spending, we've reduced the deficit. We've increased employment, increased pay. There was a survey done uh, uh, by the, uh, I forget which one it was, which one it was now, about three months ago. You had more people had lower debt (inaudible) credit cards, more savings in their savings account, higher pay in the job they had, more satisfaction in the job they had and they were in good shape financially.\nWell, two things.\nWell, I think the paradox is, part of it is, I think what, the failure of the last administration to act on COVID had a profound impact on the number of people who got COVID and the number of people who died. Now here's what I'm, I think Vivek Murthy is right and most of the international and National Psychological Association, whatever it's, people are really, really down. They're really down. Their need for mental health in America has skyrocketed because people have seen everything upset. Everything they counted on upset. But most of it's a consequence of, of, of what's happening, what happened is a consequence of the, the COVID crisis.\nPeople lost their jobs. People are out of their jobs. And then, were they going to get back to work? Schools were closed. Think of this. I think we vastly underestimate this. If you had, and instead of your child being, how old, five?\nFive years old. If your child had been 17 years old two years ago.\nWell get ready, man. Boy or girl?\nWell I'll tell you what, she's gonna, she's going to be crazy about you until about age 13. And then hang on. But all kidding aside, here's the deal. Think about what it's like for the graduating classes of the last three years. No proms. No graduation. No, no, none of the things that celebrate who we are. Think about it across the board. How isolated we've become. How separated we've become. Even practical questions like, you know, can you go out on a date? I mean (inaudible) the normal socialization, how does that take place? There's overwhelming evidence it's had a profound impact on the psyche of parents, children, across the board. And we lost a million people.\nAnd nine for every, according to a study, of those million people, nine significant family or close friends were left alive after they're gone.\nYes.\nBe confident.\nBe confident. Be confident. Because I am confident. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the second quarter of the 21st century. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact.\nLook, I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than anybody, any other world leader. Imagine — let me put it — let me ask you a rhetorical question, and, you know, I mean, obviously you don't have to answer any of the questions.\nNo no. No no no. But think of this. Name me a single major company, country in the world where that world leader wouldn't trade places with my problems for his in a heartbeat. Name me one. Not a joke.\nThere are none.\nNo, Switzerland has their own problems right now. When I said major, I meant major power, so — but, no. I mean, you know, I just had the, the American, you know, the whole hemisphere, beautiful countries in the Caribbean and beautiful countries that are, have, that are middle-class countries that are having serious problems. Everybody's having them. In the meantime, we have a little thing called climate change going on. And it's having profound impacts. We got the tundra melting. We've got the North Pole, I mean, so people are looking and, and I think it's totally understandable that they are worried because they look around and see, \"My God, everything is changing.\" We have more hurricanes and tornadoes and flooding. People saw what — I took my kids years ago to Yellowstone Park. They call me, \"Daddy did you see what happened at Yellowstone, right?\" Well, it's unthinkable. These are 1,000-year kinds of events.\nSure.\nWell, I say in the short term, do the right thing. Instead of, you know, they've made 315 or 16 billion, 35 billion dollars, these major oil companies in the first quarter. So I think it's three, twelve, five ... I don't know how many times (inaudible). Don't buy back your own stock. Don't, don't just reward yourselves. I mean, look, here's what. A lot happened. One of the things I ran on when I was running is that I, I come from the corporate capital of the world, Delaware. More corporations incorporated in my state than all the rest of the United States combined. Not a joke. Literally.\nAnd, you know, they try to make me, my fr—, the MAGA party, tries to make me out to be this socialist. I got elected seven times, not just six, seven times, in that state. But one of the things that's changed is the notion of what constitutes corporate responsibility. The fact that you're in a situation where you have a Fortune 500 company, you got 55 paid zero taxes, made 40 billion dollars. Those surveys also show nobody, including Republicans in suburbia, think the tax system is fair. Billionaires paying 8%. All these things that are occurring that have to be shifted. It used to be, for example, I'll give you one example. It used to, am I holding up?\nOK.\nYes.\nYes. I think it's changing. Well, first of all, I had the votes. If I had told you (garble) ... You're not doing (inaudible). I'm impressed by your objectivity, how you write. I'm not being, I shouldn't say that on the record because then you'll get in trouble.\nBut all kidding aside. Usually (inaudible) the question I get asked in the beginning with the Recovery Act: Can you get this passed? How can you possibly do that? I got 1.9 trillion dollars. Saved the economy. It used to be long lines, people in nice cars like we drive. Lined up just to get a box of food in their trunk.\nPeople getting kicked out onto the street because they couldn't pay the rent. Thousands and thousands of people. And guess what? It worked. Secondly, no, here's the important point. The second piece of this is, that it also saw to it that we were able to provide for the funding for COVID, not only, not only the shots and the shots in arms, but also all the hospital costs. We were able to reduce the cost of insurance. My point is, people would say, \"How can you get that done?\" If I did, if any other president just passed that act, and the infrastructure bill, they'd say, \"God almighty.\"\nName me a president that's done anything like that before. At the same time.\n(Aide tells Biden time is up.)\nThat's right.\nYep.\nSure they want to know. And on that answer is no. Not one single Republican, not one, not one, would vote to extend it. We're 50/50 and we lost one Democrat vote. So I'm one vote short on that piece. But for example, I'm going to be able to get, God willing, the ability to pay for prescription drugs. There's more than one way to bring down the cost for working folks. Gasoline may be up to $5 a gallon, but somebody who has a child with stage two diabetes is paying up to a thousand bucks a month for the insulin.\nWe can reduce it to 35 bucks a month and get it done. We have the votes to do it. We're gonna get that done. That kinda thing. I can't get it all done. That's why I need the (inaudible) vote.\nOne more thing. Let's look at what our Republican friends are going to have to face with the Supreme Court decision on Roe. What they're going to have to face in terms of the Supreme Court —the failure, the failure of this Republican Party to be willing to do anything to deal with the basic social concerns of the country.\nAnd so, I think, you know, I fully understand why the average voter out there is just confused and upset and worried. And they're worried, for example, you know, can they send their kid back to, back to college? What's going to happen? Are we going to take away the ability of people to borrow? So I think there's a lot of reasons for people to want to know what comes next.\nAnd do I have the votes? I believe I have the votes to do a number of things. One, prescription drugs. Reduce utility bills by providing for, uh, I think, we'll be able to get the ability to have a tax incentive for winterization, which would, they estimate, bring down the average bill for the family, normal home, 500 bucks a year.\nI think we would be able, we're gonna get another $57 billion for semiconductors, so we don't have the supply chain problem we had before, keeping down the cost of vehicles. I think we're going to be in a situation where, we're gonna — I know we are — where we're going to reduce a person's average internet bill by 30 bucks a month, because we have the money through the, through the uh, uh, infrastructure bill to provide internet across country.\nI think we're going to be able to have a fair tax system, to have the votes, it's going to be close, to have a minimum tax on corporations of 15%, make sure we're in a situation where the people who in fact are, the idea that a billionaire is paying 8% of income and a teacher is paying 22%. I think we're going to be able to get tax increases on super wealthy. Not a lot. Not a lot. I'm a capitalist. You should be able to (inaudible). For God's sake, pay your fair share. Just pay, pay a piece of what you owe. And I think we're gonna be able to do those kinds of things.\nI know I'm supposed to go. That's the last question.\nWell, my predecessor on the wall didn't pass the (inaudible) his first year, number one. Number two, the reason ... you know why that predecessor is on the wall. You never saw his picture in this office before. I asked my brother to put together the office for me — decide what desk I'd have. I didn't realize the outgoing president had to be out 10 o'clock, the incoming president by 2 o'clock. And you pick what you want and you got to get it all in by then. So I (inaudible) Jon Meacham come in and he set my office up for me, and so the desk they picked, and you know everything, everything except the wallpaper. And I used to, I came in here for eight years in a row as the vice president. George Washington's photograph is over there.\nAnd I looked and I said, \"Why Franklin Roosevelt?\" Not that I don't like Franklin Roosevelt, but why put that big portrait of Franklin Roosevelt? And Jon Meacham said, \"Because no one ever inherited that kind of big circumstances and dire, more dire straits than he did that last time.\" I said, \"Oh, that's encouraging.\"\nAnd I said, \"Why Abraham Lincoln?\" And he said, \"The country's never been as divided since the Civil War.\" I knew those two things coming in. But what I also believed was I could get some of it done.\nThere was a, I just was reading an article (inaudible) that article by the, uh, the guy talking about Biden and how he brought the country, brought Republicans together, Republicans and Democrats. Anyway, I'll, I'll get it to you. I'll find it. Oh, here you go. New York Times Magazine. That's factually correct. Now, there's a lot I couldn't get done.\nWell, yeah. By the way, And when you remember, I called for that, everybody said, \"Oh, no, no no.\" But guess what? It's gonna pass. But my generic point is that, you know, we're going to get gun safety. We're not going to get what I wanted. We're gonna get a part where everybody, we're gonna get the, uh, the uh, uh, the, the Innovation Competition Act, a hundred million bucks is going to be invested outside of Cleveland by Intel. We're going to have another 57 mil ... . You know, there's forced arbitration I got rid of in sexual orientation, sexual harassment cases. Juneteenth I got passed, no one said it could be done.\nI'm not saying, \"Look at all I've done.\" But I knew that were probably, probably 15 sort of traditional, mainstream, conservative Republicans left. And I include in that — and I'm going to get myself in trouble, and I'll get him in trouble, probably — but the minority leader from Kentucky. He's a solid, mainstream guy. But you have the, ah, the folks from Texas. You have a lot of folks who are very, very MAGA. For example, Johnson, you know, and Scott, they're. Every five years, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid go out of existence. You've got to build them back. They, these guys mean it. I mean, why in the hell did you ever think that would happen in your lifetime, and you're a young man?\nWell, I tell you what, well at least you're keeping it. I'd settle for orange if I had more hair. But all kidding aside, I think this is a process and I think what you're going to see this election is people voting their overall concerns as well. Even people who are not pro-choice are going to find it really, really off the wall when a woman goes across a state line and she gets arrested (garble) where she's doing. Even people who are, you know, I mean, there's so many things these guys are doing that are out of the mainstream of where the public is. And I think — but it is, I knew I was stepping into a difficult moment, but — Can I say something off the record?\n(Off-the-record discussion.)", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-josh-boak-the-associated-press"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Madrid, Spain", "Date": "2022-06-30", "Text": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. If you have a seat, please sit down. You'd think someone else walked in the room. Thank you very much for taking the time to be here.\nI think we can all agree that this has been a historic NATO summit. Some of the folks who have been covering me for a while, about a year and a half ago, when the first G-7 meeting took place in England, I talked about the need for us to reconsider the makeup of NATO, how it functioned, and come up with a different strategy for the—for NATO and how we work together. And in addition to that, we also talked about the G-7 taking on additional responsibilities.\nAnd before the war started, I told Putin that if he invaded Ukraine, NATO would not only get stronger, but would get more united. And we would see—he would see democracies in the world stand up and oppose his aggression and defend a rules-based order. And that's exactly what we're seeing today.\nThis summit was about strengthening our alliance, meeting the challenges of our world as it is today and the threats we're going to face in the future.\nThe last time NATO drafted a new mission statement was 12 years ago. At that time, it characterized Russia as a partner, and it didn't even mention China. The world has changed, changed a great deal since then. And NATO is changing as well.\nAt this summit, we rallied our alliances to meet both the direct threats that Russia poses to Europe and the systemic challenges that China poses to a rules-based world order. And we've invited two new members to join NATO. It was a historic act. Finland and Sweden, two countries with a long tradition of neutrality and choosing to join NATO.\nSome of the American press will remember when I got a phone call from the leader of Finland saying could he come and see me. And he came the next day and said, \"Will you support my joining—my country joining NATO?\"\nWe got on the telephone; he suggested we call the leader of Switzerland—\"Switzerland,\" my goodness. I'm getting really anxious here about expanding NATO. [Laughter] Of Sweden. And what happened was, we got on the phone, and she asked if she could come the next day to want to talk about joining NATO.\nAllies across the board are stepping up, increasing defense spending. A majority of them are on track for the first time to exceed our 2 percent of GDP commitment that they made. They agreed to spend 2 percent of the GDP on defense.\nLook, for example, Germany: Germany has committed to spending 2 percent going forward, and announced a special fund for its military of more than $100 billion. Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands have announced they will also meet their 2 percent commitments. Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania are doing more than 2.5 percent, some as high as 3 percent. Together, they're deploying more assets and capabilities to bolster our alliances across all domains: land, air, sea, cyber, and space.\nWe've reaffirmed that our article 5 commitment is sacred. And an attack on one is an attack on all, and we will defend every inch of NATO territory. Every inch of NATO territory.\nFor our part, the United States is doing exactly what I said we would do if Putin invaded: enhance our force posture in Europe. We'll station more ships in here, in Spain. We're stationing more air defense in Italy and Germany; more F-35s in the United Kingdom; and, to strengthen our eastern flank, new permanent headquarters for the Army Fifth Corps in Poland. In addition, an additional brigade combat team positioned in Romania, and additional rotational deployments in the Baltic countries.\nThings are changing to adapt to the world as we have it today. And all this is against the backdrop of our response to NATO's—to Russia's aggression and to help Ukraine defend itself.\nThe United States is rallying the world to stand with Ukraine. Allies and partners around the globe are making significant contributions. Secretary Austin just brought together more than 50 countries—more than 50 countries—pledging new commitments, and this is a global effort to support Ukraine: nearly 140,000 antitank systems, more than 600 tanks, nearly 500 artillery systems, more than 600,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, as well as advanced multiple-launch rocket systems, antiship systems, and air defense systems.\nAnd again, the United States is leading the way. We've provided Ukraine with nearly $7 billion in security assistance since I took office. The next few days, we intend to announce more than $800 million more, including a new advanced Western air defense system for Ukraine, more artillery and ammunition, counterbattery radars, additional ammunition for the HIMARS multiple-launch rocket system we've already given Ukraine and more HIMARS coming from other countries as well.\nWe also welcomed, for the first time, our partners in the Indo-Pacific to participate in the NATO summit. As I indicated to Putin, this would be—his action would cause worldwide response, bringing together democratic allies and partners from the Atlantic and the Pacific to focus on the challenges that matter to our future and to defend the rules-based order against the challenges, including from China.\nIn the G-7 in Germany, we also launched what started off to be the Build Back Better notion, but it's morphed into the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, to offer developing and middle-income countries better options to meet their urgent infrastructure needs. Because when the United States and G-7 countries put skin in the game, it helped bring—helps bring millions of dollars up to—before it's all over—up to possibly a trillion dollars of private sector money off the sidelines: $600 billion in just the next few years.\nUnlike China, these projects will be done transparently and with very high standards. For example, the U.S. Government just facilitated a new partnership between two American firms and the Government of Angola to invest $2 billion building a significant solar project in Angola. It's a partnership to help Angola meet its climate goals and energy needs while creating new markets for American technologies and good jobs——\n[At this point, the President coughed.]\n——excuse me—in Angola. As you heard me say before: When I think \"climate,\" I think \"jobs.\"\nAnd the G-7 also said we'd work together to take on China's abusive and coercive trade practices and rid our supply chains of products made with forced labor.\nWe tasked our teams to work on the details of the price cap on Russian oil to drive down Putin's revenues without hurting Americans and others at the gas pump. We'll seek to use the funds from the tariffs on Russian goods to help Ukraine rebuild. We're committed—we've committed more than $4.5 billion—more than half of that from the United States—to address food insecurity and the immediate crisis caused by the Russian war.\nAt every step of this trip, we set down a marker of unity, determination, and deep capabilities of the democratic nations of the world to do what need be done. Putin thought he could break the transatlantic alliance. He tried to weaken us. He expected our resolve to fracture. But he's getting exactly what he did not want.\nHe wanted the Findalization [Finlandization]* of NATO. He got the NATO-ization of Finland. Just think about this: That's what he thought. Now NATO [Finland]* and Sweden are closer than ever to joining. And this will occur.\nWe're more united than ever. And with the addition of Finland and Sweden, we'll be stronger than ever. They have serious militaries, both of them. We're going to increase the NATO border by 800 miles along the Finnish-Russian border. Sweden is all in.\nThe point is, we're meeting the goals I set out when we first—the first G-7 meeting. We're moving to a place that reflects the realities of the 20—the second quarter of the 21st century. And we're on the verge of making significant progress.\nNow, I'd be happy to take your questions. And the first question, I'm told, is Darlene Superville from the Associated Press.\nOf course.\nThey do not think that. You haven't found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards. America is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world. The one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States on overruling not onlyRoev.Wade, but essentially challenging the right to privacy.\nWe've been a leader in the world in terms of personal rights and privacy rights, and it is a mistake, in my view, for the Supreme Court to do what it did.\nBut I have not seen anyone come up to me and do anything other than—nor have you heard them say anything other than: \"Thank you for America's leadership. You've changed the dynamic of NATO and the G-7.\"\nSo I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of what the Supreme Court did. I can understand why the American people are frustrated because of inflation. But inflation is higher in almost every other country. Prices at the pump are higher in almost every other country. We're better positioned to deal with this than anyone, but we have a way to go.\nAnd the Supreme Court—we have to change that decision by codifyingRoev.Wade.\nWe are going to support Ukraine as long as it takes.\nLook at the impact that the war on Ukraine has had on Russia. They've had to renege on their national debt for the first time since the beginning—almost well over a hundred years. They've lost 15 years of the gains they made in terms of their economy. They're in a situation where they're having trouble because of my imposition of—dealing with what can be exported to Russia, in terms of technology. They can't even—you know, they're having—they're going to have trouble maintaining oil production because they don't have the technology to do it. They need American technology. And they're also in a similar situation in terms of their weapons systems and some of their military systems. So they're paying a very, very heavy price for this.\nAnd just today Snake Island is now taken over by the Ukrainians. So we are going to stick with Ukraine and all of the alliance is going to stick with Ukraine as long as it takes to, in fact, make sure that they are not defeated by Ukraine—I mean, excuse me, in Ukraine by Russia.\nAnd by the way, think of this: Ukraine has already dealt a severe blow to Russia. Russia, in fact, has already lost its international standing. Russia is in a position where the whole world is looking and saying: \"Wait a minute, all this effort—you tried to take the whole country. You tried to take Kyiv. You lost. You've tried to take the Donbas and all of it. You haven't done that yet.\"\nThe generic point is that we're supplying them with the capacity—and the overwhelming courage they've demonstrated—that, in fact, they can continue to resist the Russian aggression. And so I don't know what—how it's going to end, but it will not end with a Russian defeat of Ukraine in Ukraine.\nI'm supposed to go down the list here. Jim, the New York—Jim Tankersley, the New York Times.\nLet me hear the—the second part of the question was, \"Would it bring down the price?\"\nAs long as it takes so Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine. This is a critical, critical position for the world. Here we are. Why do we have NATO?\nI told Putin that, in fact, if he were to move, we would move to strengthen NATO. We would move to strengthen us—strengthen NATO across the board.\nLook, let me explain the price—I suggested a while ago that what we should consider doing is putting a cap on the amount of money that we would pay for—the world would pay for Russian oil, and that we would not—there would—we would not provide—the West provides insurance—would not insure Russian ships carrying oil. We would not provide insurance for them, so they would have great difficulty getting customers.\nThe point is that we've said to them, \"Here's the deal: We're going to allow you to have a profit on what you make, but not the exorbitant prices that you're charging for the oil now.\" We've delegated a commission—a group of our—[inaudible]—sherpa—our national security people to sit down and work out that mechanism. We think it can be done. We think it can be done, and it would drive down the price of oil, and it would drive down the price of gasoline as well.\nIn addition, at home, I have also called for changes. We've—I've released a million barrels of oil per day from our oil reserve, and—in addition to getting other nations to move forward—a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Number one.\nNumber two, I've asked Congress would they, in fact, go and end the—temporarily end the tax on gasoline at the pump. And thirdly, to ask the States to do the same thing.\nIf we do these things, it's estimated we could bring down, tomorrow, if they—if Congress agreed and the States agreed, we could bring down the price of oil about a dollar a gallon at the pump, in that range. And so we could have immediate relief in terms of the reduction of the—of the elimination of—temporary elimination of the gas tax.\nAnd so I think there's a lot of things we can do and we will do. But the bottom line is, ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia: Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.\nAnd so that's the way in which I think we should move, and I think it would have a positive impact on the price at the pump as well.\nJordan Fabian, Bloomberg.\nOf course.\nWhat I said was—I said back in December, as you'll recall, we should sell them the F-16 jets and modernize those jets as well. It's not in our interest not to do that. And I indicated to them that I've not changed my position at all since December.\nAnd there was no quid pro quo with that; it was just that we should sell. But I need congressional approval to be able to do that, and I think we can get that.\nWell, first of all, that's not the purpose of the trip. The purpose of the trip—my—first of all, I'm starting off on that trip in Israel. And the Israelis are—believe it's really important that I make the trip. And in addition to that, what we're trying to do is that the G-7—it's the Gulf States plus three. And so I'm sure the—it's in Saudi Arabia, but it's not about Saudi Arabia. It's in Saudi Arabia.\nAnd so there's no commitment that is being made or—I'm not even sure; I guess I will see the King and the Crown Prince, but that's not the meeting I'm going to. They'll be part of a much larger meeting.\nAnd what we're talking about in dealing with that trip is that, before I go, I'm, as I said, going to Israel to meet with Israeli leaders to affirm the unbreakable bond Israel and the United States have. And part of the purpose is—the trip to the Middle East—is to deepen Israel's integration in the region, which I think we're going to be able to do and which is a good—good for peace and good for Israeli security. And that's why Israel leaders have come out so strongly for my going to Saudi.\nBut the overall piece here is, we're also going to try to reduce the deaths and—in the war that's occurring in Yemen. There's a whole range of things that go well beyond anything having to do with Saudi, in particular.\nNo, I'm not going to ask them. I'm going to ask—there's—all the Gulf States are meeting. I've indicated to them that I thought they should be increasing oil production, generically, not to the Saudis particularly. And I think we're going to—I hope we see them, in their own interest, concluding that makes sense to do.\nAnd you know, they have real concerns about what's going on in Iran and other places in terms of their security as well—all of them.\nTarina [Tarini Parti], the Wall Street Journal.\nNo, I—the war could end tomorrow, by the way, if Russia stops its irrational behavior. So, you know, when the war will end, I hope it ends sooner than later.\nBut for it to end, they have to be in a position where the Ukrainians have all that they can reasonably expect, we can reasonably expect to get to them, in order to provide for their physical security and their defenses.\nAnd so one does not relate to the other. They need—we're going to be providing another—well, I guess I'll announce it shortly, but another $800 billion—$800 million in aid for additional weaponry, including—you know, weapons—including air defense system, as well as offensive weapons. I have a whole list I'd be happy to give to you. But that's the next tranche that's going to occur.\nI'll be happy to go in detail with you on that, on the—I'm having a meeting with a group of Governors when I get home on Friday. And I'll have announcements to make then.\nBut the first and foremost thing we should do is make it clear how outrageous this decision was and how much it impacts not just on a woman's right to choose—which is a critical, critical piece—but on privacy generally. On privacy generally.\nAnd so I'm going to be talking to the Governors as to what actions they think I should be taking as well. And—but the most important thing to be clear about is, we have to change—I believe we have to codifyRoev.Wadeinto law. And the way to do that is to make sure that Congress votes to do that. And if the filibuster gets in the way—it's like voting rights—it should be, we provide an exception for this—the—require an exception to the filibuster for this action to deal with the Supreme Court decision.\nAbortion Rights/Codification of Roe v. Wade/U.S. Supreme Court\nHang on. I got one more here. Kelly O'Donnell, NBC.\nRight to privacy, it's not just abortion rights. But yes, abortion rights.\nYeah, I am. I'm the President of the United States of America. [Laughter] That makes me the best messenger.\nAnd I really think that it's a serious, serious problem that the Court has thrust upon the United States not just in terms of the right to choose, but in terms of the right to who you can marry, the right—a whole range of issues relating to privacy.\nAnd I have written, way back, a number of law review articles about the Ninth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment and why the—privacy is considered as part of a constitutional guarantee. And the—they've just wiped it all out.\nAnd so I'm the only President they've got, and I feel extremely strongly that I'm going to do everything in my power which I legally can do in terms of Executive orders, as well as push the Congress and the public.\nThe bottom line here is: If you care—if the polling data is correct, and you think this decision by the Court was an outrage or a significant mistake, vote. Show up and vote. Vote in the off-year and vote, vote, vote. That's how we'll change it.\nNo, there's no such thing as a quick one. I'm out of here. Thank you all very much. Which way am I going here?\n[Several reporters continued to ask questions at once as the President exited the stage.]", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-madrid-spain"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Yair Lapid of Israel in Jerusalem, Israel", "Date": "2022-07-14", "Text": "Thank you very much, Prime Minister. [Inaudible]—an eloquent statement.\nI'm honored to be back here in the capital of Israel.\nAs I said yesterday, I've met every Prime Minister since Golda Meir, and it was a pleasure to be able to spend some time with you today and to get to know you better. Mr. Prime Minister, a deep love and respect for Israel has only taken a deeper hold of my heart and my gut since I first visited here back in 1973 as a young Senator.\nI'm returning for my 10th visit as—this time, as President of the United States. But I've never forgotten what Prime Minister Meir told me when I was a brandnew junior Senator from the State of Delaware. It was just weeks before the Yom Kippur war, and she could see on my face that I was worried.\nAs we stood before the press taking questions and pictures, she looked at me, and without press hearing, she said: \"Don't look so worried, Senator. Israel has a secret weapon.\" And I looked at her as I turned my head, and she was going to tell—I just looked at her, and she said: \"We have nowhere else to go.\" I'll never forget what she told me. That was nearly 50 years ago. Fifty years ago, the threats then were real. And the threats to Israel remain real today.\nThe scourge of anti-Semitism still marches around the world, and we must never forget the horrors which an unchecked hatred can lead. And that's why I immediately—when I returned, I wanted to visit Yad Vashem—when I landed yesterday—to bear witness, to remember, to renew our vow of never—never—again.\nAt the same time, the Israeli—the Israel of today is not the Israel of 50 years ago. You've cultivated new resources, capabilities, new relationships, including a growing integration with neighbors in the region.\nYou have new tools that keep Israel strong and secure. You have an ironclad commitment from the United States of America to Israel's security. An ironclad commitment. We'll make sure that Israel can defend itself by itself.\nWhen I was Vice President under President Obama, we passed a record-setting agreement for Israel's security: $38 billion over a 10-year period. And I was proud that, last year, we also provided an additional $1 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome supplies, making 2022 the largest single year of military assistance that Israel has ever received.\nYesterday I viewed some of Israel's Iron Dome technology, as well as the very promising new Iron Beam technology, a laser-enabled missile defense system. These technologies and advancements are critical. They're critical because every rocket that is intercepted is a potential life—perhaps more—that has been saved.\nAnd as we move forward together, partners in both security and in innovation, the United States and Israel defense sectors will cooperate in new high-energy laser weapons systems that can defend Israel—Israeli lives, as well as lives of American servicemembers.\nIsrael and the United States also stand together to defend fundamental values and underwrite global security, prosperity, and freedom, not just for us, but for many around the world. And Putin's assault on Ukraine is a challenge to the peace and stability everywhere in the world. Putin's war must be a strategic failure, and the free world must sustain our resolve to help Ukraine defend its democracy. The United States will continue to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people who have been devastated and displaced by the Russian violence.\nToday you and I also discussed America's commitment to ensuring Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. This is a vital security interest to both Israel and the United States and, I would add, for the rest of the world as well. I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome. And we'll continue to work with Israel to counter other threats from Iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and the ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorists and proxies like Hizballah.\nWe'll also continue building on the Abraham Accords, which I strongly support, because they deepen—they deepen—Israel's integration into the broader region and establish lasting ties for business, cooperation, and tourism.\nWe've just completed the first leaders' summit among Israel, India, United States, and the United Arab Emirates to deepen the economic ties between the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific, to create new partnerships to tackle global challenges, like food insecurity and clean energy technology.\nRegional integration is also the goal of the historic Negev Forum, which took place here in Israel this past March. Israel's integration in the region, Israel's peace with its neighbors, these are essential goals. Tomorrow I'll be the first American President to fly from Israel directly to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. That represents important progress.\nAnd when I see the Saudi leadership tomorrow, I'll be carrying a direct message, a message of peace and extraordinary opportunities that a more stable and integrated region could bring to the region and, quite frankly, the whole world.\nAs we work together toward greater integration—greater integration, we'll also continue to work for—toward a lasting negotiated peace between the State of Israel and the Palestinian people. Israel must remain an independent, democratic, Jewish state—the ultimate guarantee and guarantor of security of the Jewish people not only in Israel, but the entire world. I believe that to my core.\nAnd the best way to achieve that remains a two-state solution for two people, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land, living side-by-side in peace and security; both states fully respecting the equal rights of their citizens; both people enjoying equal measures of freedom. And any more that takes us further from that outcome—I believe—anything is detrimental to the long-term security of Israel.\nPrime Minister Lapid, Israel and the United States are natural partners because we share the same values. Our people share the same innovative spirit, the same determination to preserve and persevere through every single challenge.\nThat's why we're launching a new High-Level Strategic Dialogue on Technology that's going to help Israel and the United States harness critical and emerging technologies and apply them to issues that matter most to our mutual futures.\nSo thank you, Mr. President [Prime Minister],* for welcoming me back, for fostering the enduring bonds—and continuing them—that link the people of Israel and the United States.\nThat's what this visit is about: affirming those ties that stretch back to just 11 minutes—11 minutes—after Israel declared statehood, when the United States became the first country in the world to recognize Israel. And I assure you, it will be the last country in the world ever to walk away from Israel.\nTies that have grown deeper and broader with each passing year and now encompass a 21st-century partnership, one grounded on ageless values and looking squarely at the future. We're here to stay, Mr. President—Mr. Prime Minister. Like it or not, we're with you. [Laughter] There's no way out. [Laughter]\nI want to thank you very, very much for your hospitality. And I mean it from the bottom of my heart that your security, the security—the—is going to determine the security of Jewish people around the world for the rest of the world. It's critical. And we're in it with you. Thank you.\nThese guys work awful hard.\nThe answer to your last question is no. [Laughter]\nWith regard to your first question, we've laid out for the people—for the leadership of Iran what we're willing to accept in order to get back in the JCPOA. We're waiting for their response. When that will occur—when that will come, I'm not certain. But we are not going to wait forever.\nSure. I was given a list here. Steve Holland of Reuters.\n2018 Death of Journalist Jamal Khashoggi/Saudi Arabia-U.S. Relations/Middle East/Human Rights\nWith regard to the question you asked me, my views on Khashoggi have—they've been absolutely, positively clear. And I have never been quiet about talking about human rights.\nThe question that I'm—the reason I'm going to Saudi Arabia, though, is much broader. It's to promote U.S. interests, promote U.S. interests in a way that I think we have an opportunity to reassert what I think we made a mistake of walking away from: our influence in the Middle East.\nI'm going to be meeting with nine other heads of state. It's not just—it happens to be in Saudi Arabia. And so there are so many issues at stake that I want to make clear that we can continue to lead in the region and not create a vacuum, a vacuum that is filled by China and/or Russia, against the interests of both Israel and the United States and many other countries.\nAnd so the purpose of the visit is to coordinate with nine heads of state what are in U.S. interests and I believe in Israel's interests as well.\nI will bring up—I always bring up human rights. I always bring up human rights. But my position on Khashoggi has been so clear. If anyone doesn't understand it in Saudi Arabia and everywhere else, then they haven't been around for a while.\nI'm optimistic. [Laughter]\nWith regard to your question to me, we are working very, very, very hard to eliminate the lack of precision in the applications, many times, for the visa program. It is my hope and expectation that in the next several months, we'll have it worked out.\nAll right. The next person to ask us a question, I guess—[laughter]—is Nadia.\nNo, I'm not going to allow that. [Laughter]\n[The President pretended to begin leaving the podium.]\nYes, we've got to walk off. [Laughter]\nWith regard to Iran and convincing the Saudis and others that we're—mean what we say is, we mean what we say. They have an opportunity to accept this agreement that's been laid down. If they don't, we made it absolutely clear: We will not—let me say it again—we will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.\nThank you all so much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-yair-lapid-israel-jerusalem-israel"}
{"Title": "Interview with Scott Pelley of CBS' \"60 Minutes\"", "Date": "2022-09-18", "Text": "Well, first of all, let's put this in perspective. Inflation rate month to month was just-- just an inch, hardly at all.\nNo, I'm not saying it is good news. But it was 8.2% or-- 8.2% before. I mean, it's not-- you're ac-- we act-- make it sound like all of a sudden, \"My god, it went to 8.2%.\" It's been--\nI got that. But guess what we are. We're in a position where, for the last several months, it hasn't spiked. It has just barely-- it's been basically even. And in the meantime, we created all these jobs and-- and prices-- have-- have gone up, but they've come down for energy. The fact is that we've created 10 million new jobs. We're in-- since we came to office. We're in a situation where the-- the unemployment rate is about 3.7%. one of the lowest in history. We're in a situation where manufacturing is coming back to the United States in a big way. And look down the road, we have mas-- massive investments being made in computer chips and-- and employment. So, I-- look, this is a process. This is a process.\nNo. I don't think so. We hope we can have what they say, \"a soft landing,\" a transition to a place where we don't lose the gains that I ran to make in the first place for middle-class folks, being able to generate good-paying jobs and-- expansion. And at the same time-- make sure that we-- we are-- are able to continue to grow.\nNo, I'm telling the American people that we're gonna get control of inflation. And their prescription drug prices are gonna be a hell of a lotta lower. Their health care costs are gonna be a lot lower. Their basic costs for everybody, their energy prices are gonna be lower. They're gonna be in a situation where they begin to gain control again. I'm-- more optimistic than I've been in a long time.\nContinue to grow the economy. And we're growing the economy. It's growing in-- in a way that it hasn't in years and years.\nWe're growing entire new industries. Six hundred and ninety-five, I think it is, or eighty-five thousand new manufacturing jobs just since I've become president in United States. Continue to grow the economy and continue to give hard-working people a break in terms of we pay the highest drug prices in the world of any industrialized nation. Making sure that Medicare can negotiate down those prices by the way, we've also reduced the debt and reduced the deficit by $350 billion my first year. This year, it's gonna be over $1.5 trillion reduced the debt. So, to continue to put people in a position to be able to make a decent living and grow, and grow, and increase their capacity to grow.\nThe pandemic is over. We still have a problem with COVID. We're still doing a lotta work on it. It's-- but the pandemic is over. if you notice, no one's wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. And so I think it's changing. And I think this is a perfect example of it.\nWell, there's-- there's a couple things we've done. For example, remember I got some criticism for releasing a million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And then along came the industry saying they'd produce another million barrels a day by the spring. So, I think we're in relatively good shape.\nSure he is. But, you know, we, the United States, are in much better shape than-- than anyone else is, and relative to Russia particularly. But-- he's been trying that for a while. He's not gonna succeed.\nOne of the things that happens in negotiations, particularly if they've been elongated like these have, is people say and do things where they-- the pride gets engaged as well. And it's awful hard to back off of some of these things. They both sat down, in my view-- and they were in the office today saying, \"Well, we finally figured it out. This is fair on both sides.\" And it took that time to focus. And-- and the alternative was just not thinkable.\nIf, in fact, they'd gone on a strike, the supply chains in this country would've come to a screeching halt. We would've seen a real economic crisis.\nUkraine, through their-- the significant help we and our allies are giving them and the incredible bravery and the incredible determination of the Ukrainian people, are not losing a war, and they're making gains in certain areas. Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely and recognizing the sovereignty. they're defeating Russia. Russia's turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were gonna be. But winning the war? the damage it's doing, and the-- and the citizens, and the innocent people are being killed, it's awful hard to count that as winning.\nIt has been barbaric, what he's done. His attacks on civilian-- everything from civilian hospitals to-- to, you know, people-- old-age homes, to neighborhoods where just ordinary people live--\n--to schools, it's-- it's just outrageous. And-- so the-- the price Ukrainian people are paying for this war is extremely high. But we're gonna stay with 'em as long as they need our help.\nAs long as it takes.\nYes.\nDon't. Don't. Don't. You will change the face of war unlike anything since World War II.\nYou think I would tell you if I knew exactly what it would be? Of course, I'm not gonna tell you. It'll be consequential. They'll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been. And depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur.\nWe agree with what we signed onto a long time ago. And that there's one China policy, and Taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence. We are not moving-- we're not encouraging their being independent. We're not-- that-- that's their decision.\nYes, if in fact there was an unprecedented attack.\nYes.\nNo.\nI have not personally spoken to anyone on that-- in that regard. I'm sure my administration is aware of all of that, and so is the National Security Council. But I have not.\nNo. Not ahead of time.\nHow that could possibly happen. How one-- anyone could be that irresponsible. And I thought What data was in there that may compromise sources and methods? By that I mean names of people who helped or th-- et cetera. And it just-- totally irresponsible.\nI have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the Justice Department should move or not move on certain actions they could take. I-- I agreed I would not tell them what to do and not, in fact, engage in telling them how to prosecute or not.\nLook, if I were to say to you, I'm running again, all of a sudden, a whole range of things come into play that I have-- requirements I have to change and move and do.\nIn terms of election laws. And it's much too early to make that kind of decision. I'm a great respecter of fate. And so, what I'm doing is I'm doing my job. I'm gonna do that job. And within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here, going into next year, make a judgment on what to do.\nLook, my intention as I said to begin with is that I would run again. But it's just an intention. But is it a firm decision that I run again? That remains to be seen.\nPretty good shape, huh?\nWatch me. And ma-- honest to God, that's all I think. Watch me. If you think I don't have the energy level or the mental acuity, then-- then, you know, that's one thing. It's another thing, you just watch and-- and, you know, keep my schedule. Do what I'm doing. I-- I think that-- you know-- I don't-- when I sit down with our NATO allies and keep 'em together, I don't have 'em saying, \"Wait a minute, w-- how-- how old are you? What are you-- what say?\" You know, I mean, it's a matter of, you know, that old expression: The proof of the pudding's in the eating. I mean, I-- I-- I respect the fact that people would say, you know, \"You're old.\" And-- but I think it relates to h-- how much energy you have, and whether or not the job you're doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do.\nOh, it's focused. I'd say it's-- I think it's-- I-- I haven't-- look, I have trouble even mentioning, even saying to myself, my own head, the number of years. I no more think of myself as being as old as I am than fly. I mean, it's just not-- I haven't-- observed anything in terms of-- there's not things I don't do now that I did before, whether it's physical, or mental, or anything else.\nHow'd an old guy do that?\nThis is a really difficult time. We're at an inflection point in the history of this country. We're gonna make decisions, and we're making decisions now, that are gonna determine what we're gonna look like the next ten years from now. I think you'd agree that the impact on the psyche of the American people as a consequence of the pandemic is profound. Think of how that has changed everything. You know, people's attitudes about themselves, their families, about the state of the nation, about the state of their communities. And so there's a lot of uncertainty out there, a great deal of uncertainty. And we lost a million people. A million people to COVID. When I got in office, when I-- I got elected, only 2 million people had been vaccinated. I got 220 million-- m-- my point is it takes time. We were left in a very difficult situation. it's been a very difficult time. Very difficult.\nI love my son, number one. He fought-- an addiction problem. He overcame it. He wrote about it. And no, there's not a single thing that I've observed at all from th-- that would affect me or the United States relative to my son Hunter.\nFor example, we passed the most extensive gun legislation in 30 years, although I'm not gonna rest till we get assault weapons banned, which I did once before when I was a senator.\nAssault-- assault weapons banned. There's no rationale. Deer aren't running through the woods wearing Kevlar vests.\nAgain, I've gone to every one of those places. And in Uvalde, I spent time with every sing-- four hours. Four hours in the pain, pain, and it's just so, so unnecessary. So wrong. Who the hell m-- (SIGH) don't get me going. But I met with every one of those families and i-- and-- and the extended families for four hours. look, our kids should be learning how to read and write, not duck and cover. Think about that. Think of the mental impact on these kids going back to school. We saw it. It's wrong. It's wrong. It's not who we are. And we've gotta stop it. We've got to stop it. And the NRA continuing to push the sale of-- assault and semiautomatic weapons is bizarre.\nWell, I don't think it's impossible. But it-- it-- it's changed. What we do today, think about it, it's all personal attacks. It's about motive. It's not about, \"I disagree with you on the-- on the subject matter. And secondly, I think that-- it's-- I think it's fair to say that we've not had a president like the last president, who has made all of it so personal. I've had six Republican senators, I promised I'd never say their names and I won't, come up to me in the last two years and say, \"Joe, I agree with you, but if I-- if I vote this way it's gonna-- they're gonna primary me. I'm gonna lose an election.\" It didn't used to be that way. But it's coming back a little bit. It's coming back.\nWell, I'll tell you what, think about this. I was able to get-- we were able to get a bipartisan $1.2 trillion package done for dealing with the whole question of rebuilding the country, the roads and the highways. the fact of the matter is we've gotten a lot of things done bipartisanly. And everybody said, \"We're not gonna do anything, don't let Biden have any successes,\" et cetera. So it's still a way to go, but I think we're making some progress.\nWell, look-- I've had tragedies. I've lost part of my soul when I lost my son Beau, I lost my wife and my daughter in an accident. I think of all the people who've gone through what I've gone through and a lot more without what I had. I have had incredibly supportive family. There's so many, literally, heroes getting up every day putting one foot in front of the other with no help, I constantly think what would Beau want me to do? What would-- and, you know, this gets me a long way, this rosary.\nAnd he's looking up, and what's he say? He says, \"Why me, God?\" And the next scene, a voice from heaven, \"Why not?\" That's my dad. \"Why not, Joey? Why not you? Why not-- what makes you so different? Just get up.\" My mom's expression was, \"Just get up. Get up. Get up.\"\nA lot more to give. A lot more to give.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-scott-pelley-cbs-60-minutes"}
{"Title": "Interview with Jack Tapper of CNN", "Date": "2022-10-11", "Text": "Happy to.\nWell, I don't think he will. But I think it's irresponsible of him to talk about it, the idea that a world leader of one of the largest nuclear powers in the world says he may use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. The whole point I was making was it could lead to just a horrible outcome. And not because anybody intends to turn it into a world war, or anything. But it just -- once you use a nuclear weapon, the mistakes that can be made, the, miscalculations? Who knows what would happen?\nThere's been discussions on that. But I'm not going to get into that. It'd be irresponsible of me, just to talk about what we would or wouldn't do.\nThe Pentagon didn't have to be asked.\nI think he is a rational actor who's miscalculated significantly. I think he thought -- you may recall, I pointed out that they were going to invade that all those 100,000 or more troops there? And no one believed that he was going to invade Ukraine. You listen to what he says. If you listen to the speech, he made, after when that decision was being made? He talked about the whole idea of he was needed to be a leader of Russia that united all of a Russian speaker -- I mean, it just -- I just think it's irrational.\nNo, I didn't say he's not rational.\nI think -- I think the speech is.\nHis objectives were not. I think he thought, Jake, I think he thought he's going to be welcomed with open arms, that this was, this has been the home of Mother Russia, and Kyiv, and they were -- he was going to be welcomed. And I think he just totally miscalculated.\nI don't know what's in his mind. But clearly, he could leave. He could just flat leave, and still probably hold his position together in Russia, the idea that he's been able to convince the significant Russian -- of the Russian people that this is something that he thought made sense, but now he's accomplished what he wanted to do, and it's time to bring Russians home.\nLook, I have no intention of meeting with him. But, for example, if he came to me, at the G20, and said, \"I want to talk about the release of Griner,\" I'd meet with him. I mean, it would depend. But I can't imagine -- look, we've taken a position. I just did a G7 meeting this morning. The idea, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. So, I'm not about to, nor is anyone else prepared to negotiate with Russia, about them, staying in Ukraine, keeping any part of Ukraine et cetera. So, it would depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about. But look, he's acted brutally. He's acted brutally. He, I think, he's committed war crimes. And so, I don't -- I don't see any rationale, to meet with him now.\nYes.\nWell, no, I don't think so at all. I think, look, it was directed -- when I'm talking about, I'm talking to Putin. He in fact, cannot continue with impunity, to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, as if that's a rational thing to do. The mistakes get made. And given them -- and the miscalculation could occur. No one can be sure what would happen, and it could end in Armageddon.\nWell, no, I don't think anyone, any rational person is saying the initial use of tactical -- of a nuclear weapon, killing thousands of people, does not have the prospect of leading to something that can be way out of control.\nYes. And, by the way, let's get straight why I went. I didn't go to one -- about oil. I went about making sure that we made sure that we weren't going to walk away, from the Middle East, and what was going on. And, by the way, today, I just got off the telephone, with the President of -- I got off the phone, with the Prime Minister of Israel, and the President of Lebanon. They've worked out a deal. They've been at war -- declared war, with one another, for a long time. They've worked out a boundary relationship, along the -- in the Eastern Mediterranean, for oil. And they're going to make an agreement that is historic. We also got overflights, for Israeli planes, over Saudi Arabia. We got movement, in terms of how we would deal in the Middle East, with aggression from Iran. But it wasn't in other -- eight other -- there are eight other parties there. It wasn't about -- it wasn't about oil.\nBut we should, we should, and I am, in the process, when the -- this House and Senate gets back, they're going to have to -- there's going to be some consequences, for what they've done, with Russia.\nI'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I'm having in mind. But there will be -- there will be consequences.\nNo. Look, they've been saying this now how -- every six months, they say this. Every six months, they look down the next six months, and say what's going to happen. It hadn't happened yet. It hadn't been -- there has -- there is no -- there's no guarantee that there's going to recession. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession. That is, we'll move down slightly. Well, look, think about what's happened. We have done more. We're in a better position than any other major country in the world, economically and politically. We are -- we still have real problems. But look what we got done. We passed so much legislation that significantly it makes a -- makes the point about, for example, the American Rescue Plan, the legislation to deal with inflation, the Inflation Act, we moved along. I mean, there's so much has been accomplished, that the idea that there's something -- there's an automaticity to recession is just not -- is just not there. They keep -- they've been predicting this off and on, for the last\nIt is possible. Look, it is possible. I don't anticipate it. But I do think -- look, we talk about the impact on families. The families are, they have reason to be concerned, about energy prices. They have reason to be concerned about a whole range of issues. But look, what we've done. We've been able to -- the Inflation Reduction Act. There's -- look, I know I always quoted my dad. But my dad used to say, \"What -- is there any breathing room, for a middle- class family?\" And the breathing room is after all the bills are paid, at the end of the month, they have anything left. And there's more than one way to bring down the cost, monthly cost, for people, who in fact are struggling, that to make sure they have -- the ends meet, and they have enough money. And that's what we've done with Inflation Reduction Act. Look, we've reduced drug prices. We've allowed, for the first time, we've been trying for years, to get Medicare to be able to negotiate drug prices. We pay the highest drug price of any nation in the world, any major nation. We are going to be in a situation, where no senior is going to have to pay more than $2,000 a year, for the drugs, no matter how much they cost. We've reduced the price -- we are going to make sure that nobody has to pay more than $35 a month for insulin, et cetera. So, there's so much that we've done. And the same with, on energy. We passed the -- look, what I ran on, I said we're going to deal with energy.\nAnd the energy problem, we're going to deal with the whole notion of global warming. We passed $368 billion worth of help, which, as the same banker is talking about, is going to bring a $1.7 trillion -- million dollar, billion dollars off the sidelines, in investment. Look what's happened -- look at the investment that's going on, in America, right now.\nOh, I think we do. I know we do. And here's the contrast. We know it -- what's the Republican platform to run on? What are they running on? What are they for? Well, they want to put Social Security, on the chopping block. Every five years, and the other leader comes along, and says, \"No, every year, it should be up for grabs.\" Medicare, Medicaid. I mean, these aren't negotiable items, in terms of whether you're going to have a continuum or not. They -- and they've -- the first thing they said they're going to do is get rid of the Inflation Reduction Act. And so, what's that doing? They're going to raise drug prices, raise medical costs, again, be sure that we're going to no longer be able to have the ability, to have tax credits, for weatherizing your homes, and money?\nI mean, I don't know what they're for.\nWell, first of all, I'm proud of my son. This is a kid, who got -- not a kid, he's a grown man. And he got hooked on, like many families have had happened, hooked on drugs. He's overcome that. He's established a new life. He is, I'm confident that he is -- what he says, and does, are consistent with what happens.\nYou get asked the question, \"Are you on drugs? You use drugs?\" He said, \"No.\" And he wrote about saying \"No,\" in his book.\nSo, I have great confidence in my son. I love him. And he's on the straight and narrow, and he has been, for a couple years now. And I'm just so proud of him.\nWell, they're concerned about whether or not I'd get anything done. Look what I've gotten done. Name me a president, in recent history, who's gotten as much done, as I have, in the first two years. Not a joke. You may not like what I got done. But the vast majority of the American people do like what I got done. And so, I just, it's a matter of, can you do the job. And I believe I can do the job. I've been able to do the job. I've gotten more done. I got the Inflation Reduction. I got all these pieces of legislation passed. And I ran on that. I said, this is what I was going to do. And I'm still getting it done. We've had, dealing with, making sure that veterans get compensated for the, for --\nThe burn pits.\nMaking sure that we're in a situation, where we finally have action on guns. And, by the way, I'm going to get the assault weapons ban. Before this is over, I'm going to get that. Again, not a joke. And watch. And so, I just think there's a, you know, it's a matter of, has anybody done more, in the first two years of their administration, for a guy, who was -- they've been saying this about my age for -- since I began to run. And so, you know?\nWill you come work out with me in the morning?\nWell, look, I'm not going to make this about my decision. I'm going to make this off-year election. After that's done, in November, and then I'm going to be in the process of deciding.\nI believe I can beat Donald Trump again.\nThank you.\nThat's a fact! If I weren't, I'd be sleeping alone. I married a Philly girl!\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jack-tapper-cnn"}

It's about time it came home.\nTop-line reaction is really good. There's nothing bad about the report. Nothing bad about the report. And the core inflation is actually down about 1.5. We're in a situation where we've created more jobs. We're in a situation where -- and look, the price of gasoline is falling. The price of gasoline in just in the last several months is down $1.26 or $1.27. And if the -- if the oil companies start to charge what they should be charging based on the cost of a barrel of oil, it'd be down to another $0.40. And I'm going to keep pushing as I get it down.\nMy messages were getting them down. I told you I'd bring them down. We're bringing it down. I come from a family where ever gas prices went up or food prices went up, what happened? What happened was it was a conversation on the kitchen table. And we're doing a whole lot of other things. And by the way, the food prices -- the main driver of food prices is not the price of beef and eggs, etc., although they're up. It's packaged goods. Packaged goods. You're going to see people not buying Kellogg's Raisin Bran, which you're going to see them buy another raisin bran, which would be a dollar cheaper.\nI mean, so what's happening is there is a real movement. We're better positioned than any country in the world, any major country in the world. And our economy is growing and is still in a place where it's leveling out in a rational means. The other thing is that I think you're going to see that people are looking to say, wow, price -- not only gas is down, but the price of I'm not getting charged for overdraft in my checks. I'm not getting charges, right?\nThere's all kinds of things we're doing. And one of the big things was we were able to -- what we did with the Inflation Reduction Act is we reduce the cost of a lot of things for people, things that they need, prescription drugs. You know, the idea that the most senior citizen is going to have to pay for their drugs per year is 2,000. Some are paying 13,000 14,000, 15,000 because of cancer drugs. That changes. Two thousand max. If, in fact, they raise the price like they did on 1,200 prescription drugs last year for pharma companies, guess what? If they raise it higher than the price of inflation, they've got to pay it back to Medicare. So, there's a lot going on to reduce people's burdens.\nBecause it's not record inflation anymore. I'm bringing it down. Look what we inherited. I inherited 69 percent unemployment. It's down to 3.5 percent. We have -- we lost 600 -- we lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. I've -- we've created over 600,000 -- 700,000 manufacturing jobs. Things are moving. As that report shows that you have people who are now in a position where the combination of pay raises and job security, they're now in a better off, even with inflation, than they were before it. And inflation is coming down.\nI think he -- if he has no intention, why does he keep talking about it? Why is he talking about the -- the -- the ability to use a tactical nuclear weapon? He's been very dangerous in how he's approached this, and he should just get out -- he can end this all, get out of Ukraine.\nWe're going to win that case. I think in the next two weeks you're going to see those checks going out. That's my response. Thank you, man.\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\nYou guys are all over, aren't you?\nNo, it's really quite -- I mean, I don't know whose idea it was, but it's a hell of an idea. Because you're going to --\nNo, I really mean it. It really matters. And -- and you're -- you're responding, in my view, how people live. They -- they don't have chance to sit in front of the news for, you know, 40, 50 minutes. You know, you're picking up what's happening around the world in -- in local communities.\nCongratulations.\nThanks for having me. I appreciate it.\nOK.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-reshad-hudson-nexstar-tv-syracuse-new-york"}
{"Title": "Interview with Rickey Smiley on His Morning Radio Show", "Date": "2022-11-01", "Text": "Hey, Ricky. How you doing, man?\nGlad to be on your show. Thank you. And by the way, Tuskegee University's good, but it ain't Delaware State, you know. I just want you to know. I'm prejudiced about Delaware State.\nThey got me off the ground way back when I was starting.\nWell, I hope I've improved the lives of African Americans like I said I would do. For example, too many African Americans were denied everything from Pell Grants, student loans, housing, etc. because they were arrested for possession of marijuana, many -- too many, all whites as well. So, anybody who was ever arrested just for the possession of marijuana, their record is expunged. They're not in the list more, and it's going to free up a lot of opportunities. I've also made sure that we are going to provide for student debt relief. You have 70 percent of African Americans receive Pell Grants. And what I've done, I've forgiven loans of $10,000 for every eligible borrower, an additional $10,000 if you had a Pell -- a Pell Grant. And -- and, you know, those historic resources of support, I've also put in $6 billion for HBCUs for a simple reason. You know, the -- the students at Black universities are extremely qualified, qualified as anybody at any other university, but because they don't have great endowments, they don't have these significant laboratories that teach every -- the technical things that need -- they need to be taught. And so, this allows these universities to build these facilities so that, now, you graduate and you have the same training as you went to -- you went to Harvard or you went to, you know, any other state university. And in addition to that, I kept my commitment. And I'm really excited about the fact we had the first Black Supreme Court justice --\nKetanji Brown Jackson. And she is really something else. You're going to be really pleased with her. I've appointed more female Black Americans to the -- to the courts, to the federal bench than --\nI can believe every other president combined. And so, look, there's a lot -- and, by the way, you know, we now have a national holiday because I made sure that we're going to deal with what we said we were going to deal with. But the things that I think make the biggest difference, Rickey, that people haven't noticed -- I mean, it's not obvious -- is, for example, on COVID vaccinations --\nI made sure that we went exactly where the Black community is, so they weren't left behind. So, the number of -- percentage of African Americans receiving their COVID shots is as high, in some cases, higher than all other Americans because I didn't want them being left behind. We went to their communities to make sure that the docs were available to give them what they needed. And so, you know, there's -- with police, we restricted [Inaudible] chokeholds and signed executive orders and no-knock warrants, but I still support funding the police. But we should be funding the police, particularly in Black communities where you have -- where you have more social workers. We have more people doing the kinds of things that are -- are that -- that are -- equipped the law enforcement to deal with things other than by pure force. And we have to hold cops accountable. But -- but -- but we need police officers. I'm not a defund-the-cops guy, but I'm fund them and give them assistance that they need. Retrain them as to how they, in fact, are trained. That's all – I provided the money to do that. So, there's a lot going on. And I feel really, quite frankly, good that, you know --\nAnd we're replacing every lead pipe in America, ensuring everyone across this whole country has good drinking water. And I'm sure that South Carolina -- anyway.\nAnd -- so -- so, there's a lot going on. I'm probably talking too much. I'm sorry.\nWell, I think they are excited. I think -- I don't know for certain, and these polls are hard to read. But a lot of early voting. The estimates are there's a lot more Democrats early voting than Republicans. I hope that's true. And by the way, you know, I'm on -- I want this to be a celebration like -- like Juneteenth, you know. I want this to be a big day.\nAnd one of the things you have to do is understand what the Republicans are going to do if they win. They're going to cut back on everything we've done. If you have a mom or dad on Medicare and they have diabetes, well, I've lowered the cost of -- put a cap of $35 a month rather than $450 a month for them to be able to get their -- their -- their insulin. So, they don't have to share it with anybody. They can have it. I'm going to make sure that there's insurance coverage for African -- we've reduced unemployment in the Black community from 16 percent or thereabouts down to 5.8 percent. We got more to do, but we're -- look, I -- and I've made a commitment. And you know I made it because you've followed it -- that we're going to have my administration look like -- look like America.\nSo, we have more African Americans in senior positions, from the head of the Defense Department on. You know, and by the way, I remember, I know you're a fraternity guy. Well, you know, The Divine Nine.\nWell, for the first time ever, The Divine Nine met back last year in -- and on October last year with -- for the first time, the vice president of the United States, who was part of The Divine Nine, I might add. And it's a matter of making sure that every Black organization and the Black community is treated as fairly as possible and has economic opportunity because we still have a circumvent. If a developer builds a development -- housing development on one side of a highway, major highway and is occupied by a majority of Black and on the other side of the highway, it's occupied by a majority of whites, the same exact house will sell for somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent less --\nIn the Black community than it will in the white. And we've got to change that. We're going to provide -- we're allowing -- we're providing start-up funding for new businesses, for, you know, small business administration. I'm just excited about what more we can do as well. You know, I mean, we've got to hold police accountable but fund them. We've got to make sure that African Americans have the same chance that anybody else does. And -- and that's not happening until we've gotten off with a big change.\n[Inaudible] around, Rickey. I'm here before you. But, by the way, vote, vote, vote, vote. It's important. Democracy is literally at stake here. I mean, it genuinely --\nIs at stake here. The HBCU homecoming season across the country is going on now. No better way to honor the legacy of HBCUs than by voting, voting, voting.\nThank you. Appreciate you, Rickey.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-rickey-smiley-his-morning-radio-show"}
{"Title": "Interview with Al Sharpton on \"Keepin' It Real\"", "Date": "2022-11-06", "Text": "Well, Reverend Al, you know this as well as I do. You think about this new Republican Party. This is not your father's Republican Party. These are neither Republicans. It's Trump Republicans. And they -- number one, they think the only election that is one that is legitimate is one they won. If they didn't win, there must have been -- there must have been fraud. And so, they won't accept -- you have 320 so election deniers on the Republican ticket running for those offices that control the electoral process in the state -- the states and local offices, as well as federal. And they made no bones about it. And these guys, how in God's name can you call yourself a supporter of the Constitution when you say you only win when -- when you win. If there is any dispute, then it must be that there was cheating. And number two, all these guys who stormed the -- one who stormed the Capitol on January 6th, they refer to them as heroes. Some of them say they want to be -- they want to see them, you know, pardoned. I just think it is just completely contrary to anything I've seen and you have seen in our lifetime in terms of a national position to take.\nYes.\nWell, first of all, the Black community has had my back. That's why I got involved in politics. You know, Al, one of the few people know --\nThe largest Black population in America here in the state of Delaware, as a percent of population, has been the source of my strength. And that's what got me involved in politics in the first place. I made a -- I made a number of promises. Number one, I said I'm going to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court -- woman on the court. We did it. And we did it in a way that -- with the great help of Ketanji Brown Jackson. We did it, and a great help from the senator from Illinois, Dick Durbin. We found ourselves in a situation where I said I want the bench to look more like the country. Al, we have appointed -- I have appointed more appellate court justices on this -- on the federal court system than every other president combined, and even Black women. I said that I was going to forgive some student debt. I was going to help HBCUs. HBCUs have as many qualified student as any other institution. But what the problem -- they don't -- they don't have endowments. So, they don't have the laboratories. They don't have the places where the jobs of the future are going to be, you know, from the high-tech jobs. Well, guess what? We got some $5 billion, and we're not stopping now. And, you know, the idea is that, in terms of the crime, you know, every Republican who voted against my rescue plan, which gave billions of dollars directly to cities and states with the flexibility leaning toward community programs, directed toward crime prevention, they're the reason why they kept good cops on the beat. And -- and the other thing I did, I made sure that although I couldn't get the -- the -- the legislation passed, the George Floyd legislation passed, I'm coming back at it. But I -- I just initiated, by executive order, at the federal level. No chokeholds, no no-knock warrants. I was able to do it at a federal level. And look, the other thing is, Al, you know, we've talked about this. And every Black person understands this, that Black crime is one that, in fact, are the victims of the crime.\nThey're in -- they're in their communities. And they -- they want help to retrain the way we train police. We have to train police to be able -- and we need more social workers. We need more psychologists. We need more people with mental health backgrounds in -- on police forces so that we don't just have the guy come in a -- you know, we -- we don't -- for example, we don't have up-armored Humvees rolling in the neighborhoods anymore, and that's not going to happen on my watch. And so, in addition to that, what we've done is we've provided -- you know, Black employment is way up. We've provided loans for small businesses and housing for young Blacks who are just starting, who need -- who need the -- the down payment. We've -- I provided the student loan benefits, commit 20,000 bucks to student loan forgiveness. If, in fact, you went to a school with a -- with not just $10,000, but another $10,000 if you had a Pell Grant. What I've done with regard to the -- you know, dealing with the -- not just a course, but also with the notion of what we're going to do to provide for opportunities for Black Americans. I said that I was going to make sure my -- my administration look like America. We have more African Americans in high positions, both on the cabinet -- in the cabinet, as well as throughout my administration. And I'm still working on doing even more. The bottom line is everything we've done has been designed to help the community and other communities like the Black communities, the Hispanic communities in a similar situation. And it's about time that we gave the kind of help we need. And every single thing that I've proposed, with virtually one or two exceptions, the Republican Party has been against it. And guess what? Their whole proposal, if they win and take back the House and the Senate is to do away with all the things that I've said. Not a joke. Do away with all the things that I've said. They don't want student debt going through. They don't -- forgiveness. They don't want to see where we go in Black HBCU. They don't want -- like the fact that I was able to cut the cost of prescriptions for starting in the 1st of the year. Any senior that is in -- that has -- will never have to pay more than $2,000 a year for Medicare for all their drugs, even the $10,000; $12,000; $14,000 year. I've -- I've made -- delisted the -- not -- I've seen to it that anyone that's in jail for mere possession of marijuana has that wiped off their record. And if they're out of jail -- look, first of all, they're no longer in jail. And two, if they're out of jail, their record gets wiped clean because they don't have a shot. And everybody, for example, getting out of prison should be able to, once they serve their time, qualify for all the programs from Pell Grant, to housing, to the whole range of things. We're going to give people a chance. Give a chance, that's all they're looking for is a chance. And -- and -- that's -- that's what I'm -- I have great confidence in the leadership of the African American community. I really do, Al. You've -- you've -- anyway, I'm -- I'm sorry to get so --\nTwo weeks after I did the funeral, preached at the funeral of George Floyd, I did a one-year-old kid's funeral in Brooklyn from -- he was in across from a gang fight. And you've tried to deal with guns. And you've done it against with other groups you had, at our request, the hate summit, with all of this stuff --\nAl, look, you are, all those groups are my -- are the salvation of this country in terms of hate and crime. I mean it sincerely. You know, you and other civil rights leaders came to the White House. You laid out your cares and concerns as a -- and the AA community, the -- and the door is always open. You know, I said in the beginning. You knew I meant it. A lot of people didn't know me as well were surprised. The door at the White House is always open. That matters of -- and policies have directly benefited the African American community and other minority communities. Look, we are -- we just have such opportunities if we just step up. My concern in this election, though, is, if we don't win, they're going to wipe out everything we've done. I'll be able to veto some of this stuff, but some of it's going to wipe out. It's going to go away. And it makes no sense. You know, voting rights -- and I prioritized that issue on -- from day one. Department of Justice says, \"Double the voting rights staff,\" has challenging provisions in the state restrictions in Georgia, Arizona, Texas. We've launched a task force on the 21st to combat threats against election workers. You know, I want to be clear. America should feel safe going to the polls. Did you ever think, Al, you would see -- I guess you may have because you've seen it in the South and during the civil rights movement, where you have people sitting outside the polling place, and then they are 14, 15 --\nIt's outrageous. It's outrageous.\nThanks, Al. Thanks a lot. Keep it going, Al.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-al-sharpton-keepin-it-real"}
{"Title": "Interview with D.L. Hughley on His National Radio Show", "Date": "2022-11-08", "Text": "How are you doing? It's been a while, man. How are you doing?\nI'm doing well. I'm doing well.\nWell, you know, people are really hurting, and -- and they were hurting a lot when we started this campaign.\nAs you know, you know, we -- we inherited a -- a hell of a mess. Unemployment was sky-high. We cut it to more than half. Black unemployment was sky-high. We've cut it down to one of the lowest rates it's ever been. You know, the fundamental thing I've tried to do is change the whole dynamic how we look at the economy.\nAnd that is I want to build this economy. And I really mean it. You know me well to know it. And I want to build it from the bottom up and the middle out because when the middle class is doing well and the poor have a shot, they have a ladder up, and the -- and the wealthy do fine -- because I'm not worried about them. And -- but the other piece of this is I think it is -- part of it is just changing the whole attitude. I want to completely, thoroughly, and not a joke, integrate the Black community into everything that's going on. I have appointed more African American judges. I put the first Black Supreme Court justice on the court. I have -- my staff has significantly more African Americans than most administrations. You know -- and I want to make sure that we provide for -- some funding for first-time homebuyers --\nWith a small businesses, so they could have a shot. And -- and in addition to all that, you know, we're trying to -- like, for example, we dealt with the child care tax credit before the Republicans knocked it out. It was -- it reduced child poverty in America by 40 percent. I mean, it was a gigantic help to people.\nWe do.\nYeah. And, by the way, that's what -- that's what I'm talking about. And you talk about, you know, you have -- you have over 300 people, D.L., who are running for office on the Republican ticket who deny that we won the election. They -- they deny that the last election was legitimate, number one. Number two, you have these same people arguing that they're not sure they're going to accept the results unless they win. And, you know -- and then you had that -- that -- that storming of the Capitol on January the 6th, and they're calling these guys patriots. And how the hell can you say we have a -- you're -- you're a democrat with a small D, or you're someone who really cares about the nation when you say, \"The only elections that matter are the ones we win. If we lost, it was cheated.\" And secondly, that -- the guys and women who -- who broke through those doors and two cops ended up dying, and that these guys are patriots?\nRight.\nGuns, guns, guns, guns, guns, guns. That's what -- what's really up is murder and -- and injury from guns. Look, the idea, the idea that these Republicans are fighting with -- and standing with the NRA and saying we should allow assault weapons on the street, the idea that you can sell a damn -- have a -- go in and buy a cartridge that holds up to 100 rounds of bullets in it, the idea that you're able to do this with impunity and be able to purchase it is just outrageous. It makes no sense at all. You may remember, when I passed the -- the assault weapons ban in the '90s when I was a senator, violent crime dropped and then mass shootings dropped precipitously. And -- and then, you know, the Republicans wouldn't keep it. The other thing is we have to spend a lot more time with youth and dealing with the things that have to do with helping them through their circumstances. You know, for example, crime prevention programs in communities, there's a lot of really good ones. Crime actually comes down. You have to embrace -- and when you let -- when someone serves their time in jail and they get out, they shouldn't be further penalized. They should be able to get Pell Grants to go to school. They should be able to live in public housing. They should be able to have -- take access to everything that's out there. You give them 25 bucks and a bus ticket, they end up under the same bridge they're under before.\nI know. I know more -- I mean, I might know as much about this as you do, old buddy. And let me tell you --\n[Inaudible] my whole life.\nAnd if the MAGA Republicans, these right-wing Republicans -- this is not your father's Republican Party. This is -- this isn't Governor Rockefeller. This isn't -- this is a different breed of cat. And they care about your community about as much as -- well, anyway. You've seen what you've got from that community. And -- and it matters.\nAll the time -- every time I'm walking on my grandpa Finnegan's house up in Scranton, which is a working-class neighborhood, he'd say, \"Joey, keep the faith.\" And my grandmother, \"No, Joey, spread it. Spread the faith.\"\nAll right. Bye-bye.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dl-hughley-his-national-radio-show"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2022-11-09", "Text": "Good afternoon.\nAudience members. Good afternoon.\nWell, we had an election yesterday. [Laughter] And it was a good day, I think, for democracy. And I think it was a good day for America.\n[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]\nExcuse me, I'm a little hoarse.\nOur democracy has been tested in recent years. But with their votes, the American people have spoken and proven once again that democracy is who we are.\nThe States across the country saw a record voter turnout. And the heart and soul of our democracy—the voters, the poll workers, the election officials—they did their job, and they fulfilled their duty, and apparently, without much interference at all—without any interference, it looks like. And that's a testament, I think, to the American people.\nWhile we don't know all of the results yet—at least, I don't know them all yet—here's what we do know. While the press and the pundits are predicting a giant red wave, it didn't happen. And I know you were somewhat miffed by my obsessant optimism, but I felt good during the whole process. I thought we were going to do fine.\nWhile any seat lost is painful—some good Democrats didn't win the—last night—Democrats had a strong night. And we lost fewer seats in the House of Representatives than any Democratic President's first midterm election in the last 40 years. And we had the best midterms for Governors since 1986.\nAnd another thing that we know is that voters spoke clearly about their concerns—about raising costs—the rising costs that they're—and the need to get inflation down. There are still a lot of people hurting that are very concerned. And it's about crime and public safety. And they sent a clear and unmistakable message that they want to preserve our democracy and protect the right to choose in this country.\nAnd I especially want to thank the young people of this Nation, who—I'm told; I haven't seen the numbers—voted in historic numbers again and—just as they did 2 years ago. They voted to continue addressing the climate crisis, gun violence, their personal rights and freedoms, and the student debt relief.\nLast night I was pleased to call Maxwell Frost, the 25-year-old who got elected—I guess the youngest man ever elected—to the United States Congress. And I told him that he—I told him that I was the first elected—the second youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate at 29; that I have no doubt he's off to an incredible start in what, I'm sure, will be a long, distinguished career. And when he's President, and they say, \"Joe Biden is out in the outer office,\" I don't want him to say, \"Joe who?\" [Laughter]\nBut the voters were also clear that they're still frustrated. I get it. I understand it's been a really tough few years in this country for so many people. When I came to office, we inherited a nation with a pandemic raging and an economy that was reeling. And we acted quickly and boldly to vaccinate the country and to create a stable and sustained growth in our economy; long-term investment to rebuild America itself and our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, clean water systems, high-speed internet.\nAnd we're just getting started. The interesting thing is that this is all going to really come into clear view for people in the months—in the months of January, February, March of next year. It's just getting underway. So I'm optimistic about how the public is going to even be more embracive of what we've done.\nHistoric investments that are leading companies to invest literally hundreds of billions of dollars combined to build semiconductor factories and other advanced manufacturing here in America. It's going to create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. And by the way, a significant number of those jobs are going to be jobs that pay an average of $126-, $127,000. And you don't need a college degree to get those jobs.\nAnd we're dealing with global inflation as a result of the pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine. We're also handling it better than most other advanced nations in the world. We're lowering gas prices. We looking—we're taking on powerful interests to lower prescription drug costs and health insurance premiums and energy bills.\nAfter 20 months of hard work, the pandemic no longer controls our lives. It's still a concern, but it no longer controls our lives.\nOur economic policies have created a record 10 million new jobs since I came into office. Unemployment rate is down from 6.4 when I was sworn in to 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low. And we've done all this while lowering the Federal deficit in the 2 years by $1.7 trillion. Let me say it again: $1.7 trillion. No administration has ever cut the deficit that much.\nAnd reducing the Federal deficit is one of the best things we can do to lower inflation. But while we've made real progress as a nation, I know it's hard for folks to see that project—that progress in their everyday lives. And it's hard to see the results from actions that we took while—that we have to implement what we've done. But I believe we took the right steps for the country and for the American people.\nIn fact, if you look at the polls, an overwhelming majority—I don't look at them much anymore, because I'm not sure how to read them anymore. [Laughter] I hope you are uncertain as well. But the overwhelming majority of the American people support the elements of my economic agenda—from rebuilding America's roads and bridges; to lowering prescription drug costs; to a historic investment in tacking—tackling the climate crisis; to making sure that large corporations begin to pay their fair share in taxes.\nAnd I'm confident these policies are working and that we're on the right path, and we need to stick with them. All these initiatives take hold as they do, from lead pipes being removed from schools and homes, to new factories being built in communities with a resurgence of American manufacturing. It's already created, by the way, 700,000 brandnew manufacturing jobs.\nYou've heard me say it ad nauseam: I don't know where it's written it says we can't be the manufacturing capital of the world. We are now exporting product, not jobs, around the world.\nPeople across the country are going to see even more clearly the positive effects on their day-to-day lives. But I still understand why they're hurting right now and so many people are concerned.\nAs I have throughout my career, I'm going to continue to work across the aisle to deliver for the American people. And it's not always easy, but we did it the first term. And I'll be—surprised lot of people that we signed over 210 bipartisan laws since I've become President. And we're revitalizing American manufacturing; gun safety—we did it together—and dozens of laws positively impacting on our veterans.\nAnd let me say this: Regardless—regardless—of what the final tally in these elections show—and there's still some counting going on—I'm prepared to work with my Republican colleagues. The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.\nIn the area of foreign policy, I hope we'll continue this bipartisan approach of confronting Russia's aggression in Ukraine.\nWhen I return from the G-20 meetings in Indonesia with other world leaders, I'm going to invite the leaders of both political parties, as I've done in the past on my foreign trips, to the White House to discuss how we can work together for the remainder of this year and into the next Congress to advance the economic and national security priorities of the United States.\nAnd I'm open to any good ideas. I want to be very clear: I'm not going to support any Republican proposal that's going to make inflation worse. For example, the voters don't want to pay higher prescription costs for drugs. We've cut that now. We're going to kick into gear next year—the next calendar year. And I'm not going to walk away from the historic commitments we just made to take on the climate crisis. They're not compromisable issues to me, and I won't let it happen.\nThe voters don't want more taxes for the super—tax cuts for the superwealthy and biggest corporations. And I'm going to continue to focus on cost-cutting for working and middle class families, and building an economy from the bottom up in the middle out. I know you're tired of hearing me say that, but I genuinely mean it. That's what makes America grow. The wealthy do very well when the middle class is doing well, and the poor have a way up.\nAnd while continuing to bring down the Federal deficit.\nYou know, as we look at tax cuts, we should be looking at tax cuts for working people and middle class people, not the very wealthy. They're fine. And I—look, I—if you can go out and be a multimillionaire, that's great. Just pay your fair share. That's all. That's all. Just pay your fair share. It's like those 55 corporations in 2000 [2020]* that made $40 billion and didn't pay a penny in Federal taxes.\nIt's not right. Everybody has an obligation. So now they have to pay a staggering 15 percent. And you all pay more than that for—in your taxes.\nSo I'm going to keep my commitment that no one—no one—earning less than $400,000 a year—and that's a lot of money, where I come from—are going to see their Federal taxes go up.\nAnd I want to be very clear: Under no circumstances will I support the proposal put forward by Senators Johnson and the Senator from down in Florida to cut or make fundamental changes in Social Security and Medicare. That's not on the table. I will not do that. I will veto any attempt to pass a national ban on abortion.\nBut I'm ready to compromise with the Republicans where it makes sense on many other issues. And I'll always put the needs and interests of the American people first.\nSo let me close with this. On this election season, the American people made it clear: They don't want every day going forward to be a constant political battle. There's too much that—of that going on. And there's too much that we have to do.\nThe future of America is too promising—too promising—to be trapped in an endless political warfare. And I really mean it. You've heard me say it time and again for the last 20 months or so: I am so optimistic about the prospects for America. We need to be looking to the future, not fixated on the past. And that future is bright as can be.\nWe're the only nation in the world that's come out of every crisis stronger than we went into the crisis. And that's a fact. I mean—I mean, I literally mean that: We've come out stronger than we've gone in.\nAnd I've never been more optimistic about America's future than I am today. You know, I—particularly because of all those young people I've talked about, 18 to 30. They're showing up. They're the best educated generation in American history, they're the least prejudiced generation in American history, the most engaged generation in American history, and the most involved.\nLook, after a long campaign season, I still believe what I always have: This is a great nation, and we're a great people. And it's never been a good bet to bet against America. Never been a good bet to bet against America.\nThere's nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we work together. We just need to remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. The United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity.\nAnd I'm pretty well convinced that we're going to be able to get a lot done. Now, I've been given a list of 10 people that I'm supposed to call on. And you're all supposed to ask me one question, but I'm sure you'll ask me more. [Laughter] And so let me start off with a list I've been given.\nZeke Miller, Associated Press.\n[Laughter] How come we never hold you guys to the same standards you hold us to? [Laughter] But anyway, go ahead.\nI'm teasing. I'm teasing. I'm teasing.\nNothing, because they're just finding out what we're doing. The more they know about what we're doing, the more support there is.\nDo you know anybody who wants us to get rid of the change we made on prescription drug prices and raise prices again? Do you know anybody who wants us to walk away from building those roads and bridges and the internet and so on? I don't know any—I think that the problem is, the major pieces of legislation we passed—and some of it bipartisan—takes time to be recognized.\nFor example, you've got over a trillion dollars' worth of infrastructure money, but not that many spades have been put in the ground. It's taking time. For example, I was on the phone congratulating a Californian recently and then someone in—up in Scranton, Pennsylvania—the Congressman who got elected. And he said, \"Can you help us make sure we're able to have high-speed rail service from Scranton to New York—New York City?\" I said: \"Yes, we can. We can.\"\nFirst of all, it will make it a lot easier, take a lot of vehicles off the road. And we have more money in the pot now already out there—we voted for—than the entire money we spent on Amtrak to begin with.\nAnd it's the same way—for example, I talked about, through the campaign, that we're going to limit the cost of insulin for seniors to $35 a month instead of $400 a month. Well, it doesn't take effect until next year.\nSo there's a lot of things that are just starting to kick in. And the same way with what we've done in terms of environmental stuff. It takes time to get it moving.\nSo I'm not going to change—as a matter of fact, you know there's some things I wanted to change and add to. For example, we've—had passed the most bipartisan, we passed the most extensive gun legislation—you know, rational gun policy in 30 years. And—but we didn't ban assault weapons. I'm going to ban assault weapons. They're going to try like the devil—so I'm not going to change the direction.\nI said I ran for three reasons. I'm going to continue to stay where I'm—and I know—I fully understand the legitimate concern that what I'm saying is wrong. Okay?\nOne is that I said we're going to restore the soul of the country, begin to treat each other with decency, honor, and integrity. And it's starting to happen. People are starting—the conversations are becoming more normal, becoming more—more—how can I say it?—decent.\nSecond thing I said was, I want to build a country from the middle out and the bottom up. And that way, everybody does fine. I'm tired of trickle-down. Not a whole lot trickles down when you trickle down to hard-working folks.\nAnd the third thing—I know is still very hard—I'm going to do everything in my power to see through that we unite the country. It's hard to sustain yourself as a leading democracy in the world if you can't generate some unity.\nSo I'm not going to change anything in any fundamental way.\nFirst of all, I found it interesting they waited until after the election to make that judgment, which we knew for some time that they were going to be doing. And it's evidence of the fact that they have some real problems—Russian—the Russian military. Number one.\nNumber two, whether or not that leads to, at a minimum, it will lead to time for everyone to recalibrate their positions over the winter's period. And it remains to be seen whether or not there'll be a judgment made as to whether or not Ukraine is prepared to compromise with Russia.\nI'm going to be going to the G-20. I'm told that President Putin is not likely to be there, but other world leaders are going to be there in Indonesia. And we're going to have an opportunity to see what the next steps may be.\n[Laughter] Okay.\n2022 Congressional Elections/House Minority Leader Kevin O. McCarthy/Bipartisanship/Potential Impeachment Efforts\nWell, based on what we know as of today, we've lost very few seats for certain. We still have a possibility of keeping the House, but it's going to be close. And for example, in Nevada, we won all three of those seats—contested seats. I went out for each, and I spoke with each—for each of those folks. But we won them all. I didn't know that last night.\nSo it's a moving target right now, but it's going to be very close.\nI think he's the Republican leader, and I haven't had much of occasion to talk to him. But I will be talking to him. I think I'm talking to him later today.\nYes.\nYes, because it's going to be much closer if they take control.\nIf they take—look, the predictions were—and again, I'm not being critical of anybody who made the predictions. I got it, okay? This was supposed to be a red wave. You guys—you were talking about us losing 30 to 50 seats and this was going to—we're nowhere near—that's not going to happen. And so there's always enough people in the—on the other team, whether it's Democrat or Republican, that the opposite party can make an appeal to and maybe pick them off to get the help. And so it remains to be seen.\nBut look, I doubt whether or not—for example, all the talk—I'd ask the rhetorical—I don't expect you to answer, but the rhetorical question: Do you think that, you know, Senator Johnson is going to move to cut Medicare and Social Security? And if he does, how many Republicans do you think are going to vote for it?\nSo it depends.\n\"Lots of luck in your senior year,\" as my coach used to say. [Laughter]\nLook, I think the American public want us to move on and get things done for them. And, you know, I heard that there were—it was reported—whether it's accurate or not, I'm not sure—but it was reported many times that Republicans were saying, and the former President said, \"How many times are you going to impeach Biden?\" You know, impeachment proceedings against Biden—I mean, I think the American people will look at all of that for what it is. It's just almost comedy. I mean, it's—but you know, look, I can't control what they're going to do. All I can do is continue to try to make life better for the American people.\nWell, first of all, these world leaders know we're doing better than anybody else in the world, as a practical matter. Notwithstanding the difficulties we have, our economy is growing. You saw the last report; we're still growing at 2.6 percent. We're creating jobs. We're still in a solid position. And there's not many other countries in the world that are in that position.\nAnd I promise you, from the telephone calls I still have and from the meetings I have with other heads of State, they're looking to the United States and saying: \"How are you doing it? And what are you doing? What can we do together? How\"—so I think that the vast majority of my colleagues—at least those colleagues who are NATO members—European Union, Japan, South Korea, et cetera—I think they're looking to cooperate and wanting to know how we can help one another.\nAnd what was the other question?\nOh, I'm sorry.\nWell, I'm not—I don't think we're going to break the fever for the super-mega-MAGA Republicans. I mean—but I think they're a minority of the Republican Party. I think the vast majority of the members of the Republican Party, we disagree strongly on issues, but they're decent, honorable people. We have differences of agreement on issues.\nBut they—you know, I worked with a lot of these folks in the Senate and the House for a long time. And you know, they're honest, and they're straightforward. They're different than mine, but they're—you know, they're decent folks.\nAnd so I think that the rest of the world—and a lot of you have covered other parts of the world, and you know—the rest of the world is looking at the United States. I guess the best way to say this is to repeat what you've—some of you've heard me say before.\nThe first G-7 meeting—for the public, that's the seven largest democracies—when I went to—right after we got elected, in February, after I got sworn in in January. And I sat down at a table—a roundtable with the six other world leaders from the European Union, the United—and Canada, et cetera, and said, \"America is back.\" And one of them turned to me and said: \"For how long? For how long?\" It was a deadly earnest question: \"For how long?\"\nAnd I looked at them. And then another one went on to say—and I'm not going to name them—went on to say, \"What would you say, Joe, if in fact you went—we went to bed tonight here in England, woke up the next morning and found out that thousands of people had stormed the Parliament of Great Britain—gone down the hall, broken down the doors, two cops ended up dying, a number of people injured, and they tried to stop the confirmation of an election?\" It's not the same situation, obviously, as we have. And he said, \"What would you think?\"\nAnd what—I ask the rhetorical question: What would you all think? You'd think England was really in trouble. You'd think democracy was on the edge if that happened in Great Britain. And so that's the way people were looking at us, like, \"When is this going to stop?\" Nothing like this has happened since the Civil War. I don't want to exaggerate. But literally, nothing like this has happened since the Civil War.\nAnd so what I find is that they want to know: Is the United States stable? Do we know what we're about? Are we the same democracy we've always been? Because, look, the rest of the world looks to us—I don't mean that we're always—like we're always right. But if the United States tomorrow were to, quote, \"withdraw from the world,\" a lot of things would change around the world. A whole lot would change.\nAnd so they're very concerned that we are still the open democracy we've been and that we have rules and the institutions matter. And that's the context in which I think that they're looking at: Are we back to a place where we are going to accept decisions made by the Court, by the Congress, by the Government, et cetera?\nOh, yes? [Laughter]\nWell, we just have to demonstrate that he will not take power by—if we—if he does run; on making sure he, under the legitimate efforts of our Constitution, does not become the next President again.\nSteve, Reuters. I'm sorry. Steve Holland.\nWell, first of all, Jill and I have—and by the way, this is my wife Jill—[laughter]—who's a hell of a lot more popular than I am in the Democratic Party too.\nBut at any rate, all kidding aside, our intention is to run again. That's been our intention, regardless of what the outcome of this election was. And the fact that we won—we—I didn't win, run—the fact that the Democratic Party outperformed anything anyone expected and did better than any off-year Presidency since John Kennedy is one that gives everybody, like, \"Hoo\"—sigh of relief—that the mega Republicans are not taking over the Government again, et cetera.\nAnd so my judgment of running, when I announce—if I announce—now, my intention is that I run again. But I'm a great respecter of fate. And this is, ultimately, a family decision. I think everybody wants me to run, but they're—we're going to have discussions about it. And I don't feel in any hurry one way or another what—to make that judgment today, tomorrow, whenever, no matter what the—my predecessor does.\nWell, I—my guess is—I hope Jill and I get a little time to actually sneak away—[laughter]—for a week around—between Christmas and Thanksgiving. [Laughter] And my guess is it would be early next year we make that judgment.\nBut it is my plan to do it now. I mean, but—you know.\nOkay, I'm sorry. Karen. Karen Travers of ABC Radio.\nWomen's National Basketball Association Player Brittney Y. Griner's Detention in Russia\nWell, we've been engaging on a regular basis. I've been spending a fair amount of time with her wife about what's going on with her. And my guess is—my hope is that now that the election is over, that Mr. Putin will be able to discuss with us and be willing to talk more seriously about a prisoner exchange.\nThat is my intention. My intention is to get her home. And we've had a number of discussions so far. And I am hopeful that, now that our election is over, there is a willingness to negotiate more specifically with us.\nThank you.\nYes, I can, but I won't. [Laughter] Okay, I can't—I mean, you know, it would not be a wise thing to do in order to see if they would move forward.\nBut it is my—I'm telling you, I am determined to get her home and get her home safely—along with others, I might add.\nOf TheGrio. Excuse me. [Laughter] I beg your pardon.\nI got it right last time we did this.\nWell, you know, first of all, I asked our Justice Department to defend the present policy before the Supreme Court. And like a lot of pundits, I'm not prepared to believe that the Supreme Court is going to overrule the existing decision. That's far from certain. And I don't believe that. But number one—so, number one, what I did to try to change it is object to it before the Supreme Court of the United States—our administration.\nNumber two, I—there are a number of things that we can and must do to make it—and by the way, this is a case involving an Asian American, in terms of getting into school, and whether there's affirmative action makes sense at all from the standpoint of those who are arguing against it.\nBut you know, the fact is that we're also in a circumstance where there's a lot that we can do in the meantime to make sure that there's an access to good education across the board. And that is by doing things that relate to starting education at age 3—formal schooling at age 3—which it increases—not daycare, but school. All the studies over 10 years show that that increases the prospect of someone making it through 12 years without any difficulty, no matter what the background they come from, by 56 percent.\nAnd I also think that we should be making sure that we have the ability to provide for 2 years of education beyond that, whether it's apprenticeships or community colleges. And we also are in a situation where I think that—for example, I want to make sure we—a lot of it has to do with finances as well—that we make sure that we have help for people who come from modest means to be able to get to school.\nYou know, the cost of college education has increased fourfold. And it used to be that a Pell grant would cover something like 70 percent of the college tuition. Now it covers significantly less than that. So I want to increase the Pell grants as well.\nBut let's see what the Supreme Court decides. And I am hopeful. And our team and our—the lawyers who argued for us are not nearly as certain as the people you quoted as saying it's going to be overruled.\nWell, a number of things. First of all, Black unemployment is almost cut in half under my administration just since I began. More Black businesses have opened up—small businesses—than ever before.\nWe're now in a situation where we're providing, through the Small Business Administration, downpayments for people buying homes, because most people accumulate wealth in the value of their home, most middle class families like mine. My dad bought a home, didn't have—just scraped together to get a home. By the time he was able to retire, he was—he had built up equity in a home. That's how most people do that.\nAnd so—but what I can't do is, I can't guarantee that we're going to be able to get rid of inflation, but I do think we can. We brought—we've already brought down the price of gasoline about $1.20 a gallon across the board. And I think that the oil companies are really doing the Nation a real disservice. They've made—six of them made over $100 billion in the last quarter in profit. A hundred billion dollars.\nIn the past, if they had done the two things that they had done before—one, invest in more refineries and producing more product and/or passing on the rebates to the gas stations that—you know, they sell the oil at a cheaper rate than they have to sell—than they are selling it now, not taking advantage. And that lowers the price of the total gallon of gas because that gets passed on.\nSo there's a whole lot of things that we can do that are difficult to do, but we're going to continue to push to do them.\nAnd the other thing is that one of the things that makes a gigantic difference is what are the costs that exist in the average family and the average Black community. One, prescription drug costs. Well, we're driving those down precipitously, beginning next year.\nAnd you know, I'll bet you know a lot of people in the African American and Caucasian community that need to take insulin for diabetes. Well, we're going to reduce that cost. They're not going to pay more than $35 for the insulin instead of four—average of $400.\nAnd I can go down the list of the things that—my dad used to say it a different way. At the end of the month, the things you have to pay for, from your mortgage to food on the table to gasoline in the automobile, do you have enough money to do it? And when it's done, do you have anything left over? And medical bills are a big piece of that, particularly in the African American community and the poor—and poorer communities. They need help.\nAnd so we're driving down all of those costs. And we've already passed the legislation to do that; it's just taking effect. So there's a lot of things we can do to affect the things that people need on a monthly basis to reduce their inflation, their cost of living.\nAnd so—but I am optimistic, because we continue to grow and at a rational pace, we're not anywhere near a recession right now, in terms of the growth. But I think we can have what most economists call a \"soft landing.\" I'm convinced that we're going to be able to gradually bring down prices so that they, in fact, end up with us not having to move into a recession to be able to get control of inflation.\nOkay, go ahead.\nPart of what I think leadership requires—and I hope I meet this standard—is letting people know you understand their problem. Again, my dad used to have an expression. He said, \"I don't expect the Government to solve my problems, but I expect them to at least know what they are, understand them.\"\nAnd like a lot of you, we've been very fortunate as a family, but we've also been through a lot of fairly tough times. And it's not—and I've had the great advantage of having a family to get through them.\nWhen my first wife and daughter were killed when a tractor trailer broadsided them and killed my wife and—killed my first wife and killed my daughter, and my two boys were expected to die; they were in the—it took the \"jaws of life\" 3 hours to get them out. They were on top of their dead mother and dead sister. I understand what that pain is like.\nAnd when Jill and I lost Beau after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star and Conspicuous Service Medal, a major in the United States military, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma because he lived about 200—between 2- and 500 yards from burn pit that's 10 feet deep and as big as a football field, burning every toxic waste you could find.\nYou know, I think that we understand what it's like to lose family members, mothers, fathers, to cancer—all of you have been through that kind of thing. We've been fortunate though. We've had each other. We've had strong families—Jill's sisters, my brothers, my sister.\nAnd so what we can do to deal with that empathy is make sure there's help available, make sure there's people who are there to help—whether they are a psychologist or whether they're medical doctors or whether they're social workers—to be there to help, to help just hold a hand.\nAnd, for example, we can do an awful lot for a lot of families, the families you're talking about, if we—reinstate this child tax credit. It cut child poverty by 40 percent when it was in place. I couldn't get it passed the second time around.\nSo there's a lot we can do. And the empathy is not just talking about it, it's communicating to people you genuinely understand. And I hope a lot of people don't understand, because they—I don't want people having to know the pain.\nBut the second piece of that is, let them know that you are there to help. You're there to help.\nAnd one of the things I've talked with Vivek Murthy about—and a lot of you have written about it, and you've written it well about it—is the need for mental health care in America. You know, when we got elected, there were something like, I don't know, 2-, 3-, 5 million people who had gotten their COVID shots.\nWell, in the meantime—I've got over 220 million people all three shots. But in the meantime, what happened? We lost over a million dead. A million dead.\nI read one study that for those million people, they had nine people who were—each one of them had, on average, nine people close to them. A relative, someone they're married to, a child—someone close.\nThe impact has been profound. It's been profound. Think of all the people—think of all your children and your grandchildren who didn't have that senior prom, who didn't have that graduation party, who didn't have all the things we had that we took for granted, that impact on their psyche.\nSo there's a lot we have to do. And empathy reflects itself not just on what a person demonstrates they understand—of knowing what people need and helping to make it happen. And we're trying to do that. And a lot of Republicans are trying to do it too. I don't mean this as a partisan thing. A lot of people are trying to do it because they know we've got a problem.\nOkay, excuse me. These 10 questions are really going quickly. [Laughter]\n[Laughter] Well, I've got to meet with some of my—talk to some of the Republican leadership soon. But—at any rate.\nJenny Leonard, Bloomberg.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Taiwan\nWell, look, I'm not making—I'm not willing to make any fundamental concessions because what I—what I've told him in the beginning—and this is—we've—I've spent over 78, I think they told me, hours with him so far—67 in person, when I was Vice President. President Obama knew he couldn't spend time with the Vice President of another country, so I traveled 17,000 miles with them in China and around—and the United States. I've met with him many times.\nAnd I've told him: I'm looking for competition, not conflict. And so what I want to do with him when we talk is lay out what the—what kind of—what each of our red lines are, understand what he believes to be in the critical national interests of China, what I know to be the critical interests of the United States, and to determine whether or not they conflict with one another. And if they do, how to resolve it and how to work it out.\nAnd so—and the Taiwan doctrine has not changed at all from the very beginning—the very beginning. So I'm sure we'll discuss China, the—excuse me, Taiwan. And I'm sure we'll discuss a number of other issues, including fair trade and relationships relating to his relationship with other countries in the region.\nAnd so, at any rate—so there's a lot we're going to have to discuss.\nDo you want another question?\nEverybody else got one.\nOr two or three.\nI'm going to have that conversation with him.\nTwitter, Inc., Chief Executive Officer Elon R. Musk\n[Laughter] I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at. Whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that. I'm suggesting that it's worth being looked at. And—but that's all I'll say.\nThere's a lot of ways.\nAll right. Kristen. Kristen Welker [NBC News].\nBipartisanship/2022 Congressional Elections/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine\nThank you so much, Mr. President. I appreciate it.\nI want to follow up with you on working with Republicans. Leader McCarthy again suggested that he is not prepared to write what he has called a \"blank check\" to Ukraine. And yet you expressed optimism that funding for Ukraine would continue, that the policies toward Ukraine would continue. Why should the people of Ukraine and this country have confidence in that, given the comments by Leader McCarthy?\nAnd just to follow up with you on your comments to Zeke, you said you don't need to do anything differently. If Republicans control the House, don't you need to recalibrate, to some extent, to try to work across the aisle with a Republican-led House?\nWell, let me put it this way. What I meant was, I don't have to change any of the policies I've already passed. That's what they said they want to go after.\nAnd so what I have is a simple proposition: I have a pen that can veto. Okay? So that's what I mean. I don't have to recalibrate whether or not I'm going to continue to, you know, fund the—we're going to continue to fund the infrastructure bill or we're going to continue to fund the environment, et cetera.\nWhat I—we have to—I hope—I think there's a growing pressure, on the part of the American people, expecting both parties and all elements of both parties to—to work out their substantive differences and not just, \"I'm not going to do that because it would benefit that party.\" Just make it—making it personal.\nSo I—and you know, it remains to be seen what the makeup of the House will be. But I'm hopeful that Kevin and I can work out a modus vivendi as to how we'll proceed with one another.\nThat is my expectation. It will be—and by the way, we've not given Ukraine a blank check. There's a lot of things that Ukraine wants we didn't do.\nFor example, I was asked very much whether we we'd provide American aircraft to guarantee the skies over Ukraine. I said: \"No, we're not going to do that. We're not going to get into a third world war, taking on Russian aircraft and directly engage.\" But would we provide them with all—the rational ability to defend themselves? Yes.\nWe provide those HIMARS. Well, the HIMARS—there's two kinds of, in the average person's parlance, rockets you can drop in those: one that goes over 600 miles and one that goes, oh, about 160 miles. We didn't give them any ones that go to 600 miles, because I'm not looking for them to start bombing Russian territory.\nAnd so we want to make sure that there's a relationship that they're able to defend themselves and take on what is purely a—the ugliest aggression that's occurred since World War II on a massive scale, on the part of Putin, within Ukraine. And there's so much at stake.\nSo I would be surprised if Leader McCarthy even has a majority of his Republican colleagues who say they're not going to fund the legitimate defensive needs of Ukraine.\nIt doesn't.\nWatch me. [Laughter]\nIt will be fun watching them take on each other. [Laughter]\nAll right. David Sanger [New York Times].\nNo, I'm not. See, that's up to the Ukrainians. Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\nI didn't have any in mind. You have—I was asked the question whether or not, if I recall—whether or not—what would happen if, in fact, after the—this—I think the context is that whether or not they're pulling back from Fallujah. And the—I mean, from the——\nKherson. The city of Kherson. And they're coming back across the river to the eastern side of the river—the Russian forces. And I said what's going to happen is, they're going to both lick their wounds, decide whether—what they're going to do over the winter, and decide whether or not they're going to compromise.\nThat's what's going to happen, whether or not. I don't know what they're going to do. And—but I do know one thing: We're not going to tell them what they have to do.\nRemember how you all went after him when I said that was real?\nNo, no, I'm just saying. I just—I just found it interesting that, \"Biden is being apoc—Biden is being extremist.\" And it turns out, you all are writing about it now. Kind of fascinating.\nNo and yes. No, I don't think there's a lot of respect that China has for Russia or for Putin. I don't think they're looking at it as a particular alliance. Matter of fact, they've been sort of keeping their distance a little bit.\nI do think that it remains to be seen whether Xi Jinping has decided that—or backed off of his initial judgment that he wanted Ukraine—excuse me, China to have the most powerful military in the world, as well as the largest economy.\nAnd—but he's a long way from both. But I think talk about nuclear weapons and location and the number of them and access is important to discuss.\nThank you all so very, very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you very, very much. We'll do another—we'll do another hour in—a little later. Thank you so much. [Laughter] Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1270"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Bali, Indonesia", "Date": "2022-11-14", "Text": "Welcome to Bali. [Laughter] Please.\nGood evening, everyone.\nLet me start with a few words about the recent elections held in the United States. What we saw was the strength and resilience of the American democracy, and we saw it in action. And the American people proved once again that democracy is who we are.\nAnd there was a strong rejection of election deniers at every level, from those seeking to lead our States and those seeking to serve in Congress and also those seeking to oversee the elections. And there was a strong rejection of political violence and voter intimidation. And there was an emphatic statement that in America, the will of the people prevails.\nI have—I've traveled this week, and it's been clear just how closely the world and our allies and our competitors as well have been following our elections at home.\n[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]\nExcuse me, I have a little cold.\nAnd what these elections showed is that there is a deep and unwavering commitment in America to preserving and protecting and defending democracy.\nNow, let me speak briefly about our agenda over the past few days in Egypt and in Cambodia and here in Indonesia. In this moment of great global challenges—from global inflation to the climate crisis, to Russia's brutal war against Ukraine—we're bringing together the broadest possible coalition of partners to deliver results.\nAt COP27 in Egypt, I made it clear that thanks to the bold agenda of our administration we pursued from day one to tackle the climate crisis and advance energy and security at home and around the world, the United States will meet—the United States will meet—our emissions target under the—targets under the Paris Agreement.\nAnd we're going to keep working with our partners to support the most vulnerable countries in building resilience to climate impacts and to align global ambition with the 1.5-degree Celsius goal, while supercharging our clean energy transition.\nAt the U.S.-ASEAN summit and the East Asia Summit, I laid out a commitment for—to working with our partners in the Indo-Pacific to ensure a future that's vital to this region, that's free and open and prosperous, as well as secure.\nAnd I met with our allies from Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, underscoring our commitment and deepening our engagement with our closest partners, and strengthening cooperation among our allies to meet shared threats to our own security and to their security, including the D.P.R.K.\nAnd let me meet—I just met in person with Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China. We had——\n[The President cleared his throat.]\nExcuse me. We had an open and candid conversation about our intentions and our priorities. It was clear—he was clear, and I was clear—that we'll defend American interests and values, promote universal human rights, and stand up for the international order and work in lockstep with our allies and partners.\nWe're going to compete vigorously. But I'm not looking for conflict; I'm looking to manage this competition responsibly. And I want to make sure that every country abides by the international rules of the road. And we discussed that.\nThe \"one China\" policy—our \"one China\" policy has not changed—has not changed. We oppose unilateral change in the status quo by either side, and we're committed to maintaining the peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.\nIt was also clear that China and the United States should be able to work together where we can to solve global challenges that require every nation to do its part. We discussed Russia's aggression against Ukraine, reaffirmed our shared belief in the threat where the use of nuclear weapons is totally unacceptable. And I asked that Secretary Blinken travel to China to follow up on our discussions and continue keeping the lines of communication open between our two countries.\nLooking ahead at the G-20 meetings tomorrow, we're going to be talking—taking on the very issues that matter to the people's lives, not only here, but also our allies and our partners. That means tackling the suffering that Russian aggression has unleashed, not just on Ukrainian people, but the people around the world, particularly food insecurity, and strengthening the fundamentals of our global economy for everyone: support for debt relief, reforms for multilateral development banks, investments to bolster global health security and to make the—sure the world is better prepared for the next pandemic.\nThe G-20 has been an important forum for the world's largest economies to work together for the good of people everywhere, and I'm looking forward to our meetings tomorrow.\nNow, let me close with this: On my first trip overseas last year, I said that America was back—back at home, back at the table, and back to leading the world.\nIn the year and a half that's followed, we've shown exactly what that means. America is keeping its commitments. America is investing in our strength at home. America is working alongside our allies and partners to deliver real, meaningful progress around the world. And at this critical moment, no nation is better positioned to help build the future we want than the United States of America.\nNow I'm happy to take questions. And I'm told there are going to be 4 questioners, but I'm not going to do 10 questions from each questioner—[laughter]—all right? I'll make that clear at the outset here.\nAnd—[laughter]—so, Ken Thomas, Wall Street Journal.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Taiwan\nWell, to answer the first part of your question, I absolutely believe there's—need not be a new cold war. We—I've met many times with Xi Jinping, and we were candid and clear with one another across the board. And I do not think there's any imminent attempt on the part of China to invade Taiwan.\nAnd I made it clear that our policy in Taiwan has not changed at all. It's the same exact position we've had. I made it clear that we want to see cross-strait issues peacefully resolved. And so it never has to come to that. And I'm convinced that he understood exactly what I was saying. I understood what he was saying.\nAnd look, I think the United States is better prepared than any country in the world, economically and politically, to deal with the changing circumstances around the world.\nAnd I think that—I think Xi Jinping is—we agreed that we would set up a set of circumstances where on issues that were—that we had to further resolve details, we agreed that we would have our chief of staff—our—the appropriate Cabinet members and others sit and meet with one another to discuss the details of any—every issue that we—that was raised, and we raised a lot of issues.\nSeung Kim, Associated Press.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Impact of the 2022 Midterm Elections on U.S. Foreign Policy\nNeither. And yes.\nYes, I didn't find him more confrontational or more conciliatory. I found him the way he's always been: direct and straightforward.\nAnd do I think he's willing to compromise on various issues? Yes. I think he understands that—look, I think—how can I say this tactfully? I think the election held in the United States was—still leaves a little bit uncertain—has sent a very strong message around the world that the United States is ready to play.\nThe United States is—the Republicans who survived, and along with the Democrats, are of the view that we're going to stay fully engaged in the world and that we, in fact, know what we're about. And so I don't get any sense that there's more or less confrontation.\nWe were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other's position. And we agreed we'd set up—and we did—mechanisms whereby we would meet in detail with our—the key people in each of our administrations to discuss how we could resolve them, or how, if they weren't resolved, on what basis were they not resolved.\nSebastian Smith, the AFP.\nFirst of all, it was a significant, significant victory for Ukraine. A significant victory. And I can do nothing but applaud the courage, determination, and capacity of the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian military. I mean, they have really been amazing.\nAnd I think it's hard to tell at this point exactly what it means in terms of—but I've been very clear that we're going to continue to provide the capability for the Ukrainian people to defend themselves. And we are not going to engage in any negotiation. There's no—nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. This is a decision Ukraine has to make.\nI think you're going to see things slow down a bit because of the winter months and the inability to move as easily around the country. But I think it remains to be seen exactly what the outcome will be, except that I'm confident that Russia will not occupy or defend Ukraine as they intended from the beginning.\nAh, okay, I'm having trouble reading this. Reuters, Natandya [Nandita; White House correction] Bose.\nOh, there you are.\nChina-North Korea Relations/North Korea/China-U.S. Relations\nWell, first of all, it's difficult to say that I am certain that China can control North Korea, number one.\nNumber two, I've made it clear to President Xi Jinping that I thought they had an obligation to attempt to make it clear to North Korea that they should not engage in long-range nuclear tests. And I made it clear as well that if they did—\"they\" meaning North Korea—that we would have to take certain actions that would be more defensive on our behalf, and it would not be directed against North Korea—I mean, excuse me—it would not be directed against China, but it would be to send a clear message to North Korea. We are going to defend our allies, as well as American soil and American capacity.\nAnd so—but I do not think that—it's difficult to determine whether or not China has the capacity. I'm confident China is not looking for North Korea to engage in further escalatory means. Because I made it clear—and I made it clear from the very beginning, and last year as well, that we will do what it needs to defend our capacity, to defend ourselves and our allies—South Korea, as well as Japan—and that it would be—we'd be more up in the face of China. But it wouldn't be because of China, it'd be because of what was going on in North Korea.\nSo—and again, on a number of these issues, we have put together teams where our National Security Adviser, Secretary of Defense, and others are going to be engaging with their counterparts in China to see—and we're not going to be able to work everything out. I'm not suggesting it's going—this is kumbaya, you know, everybody is going go away with everything in agreement. But I do not believe that there's a need for concern of a, as one of you raised the legitimate question, a new cold war.\nAnd I think that—I'll conclude by saying it this way: I want to be clear—and be clear with all leaders, but particularly with Xi Jinping—that I mean what I say and I say what I mean, so there's no misunderstanding. That's the biggest concern is—I have is a misunderstanding about intentions or actions on each of our parts.\nSo we went in to—I'll look at my team—how long did that meeting last?\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken.Three and a half hours.\nThree and a half hours. So we covered an awful lot of territory. And I must say that he was as straightforward as he has been with me in the past. And I think that we understand one another, which is the most important thing that can be done.\nI guess all of you are going swimming from here. It's not far. [Laughter] But——\nI don't think they can expect much of anything other than, we're going to maintain our positions.\nI'm not going to get into more questions. I shouldn't even have answered your question.\nI don't think there's enough votes to codify, unless something happens unusual in the House. I think we're going to get very close in the House. But I don't—I think it's going to be very close, but I don't think we're going to make it.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bali-indonesia"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France", "Date": "2022-12-01", "Text": "Well, everyone, please. Take a seat if you have one. [Laughter] Well, it's great to see you all today. President Macron and I have had a chance to spend some time together. We went to a private dinner last night with our wives, and we're—just came to tell you that, and we're leaving. [Laughter] No.\nBut we're—we've—it's wonderful to have him here. We've had a great conversation and always appreciate the opportunity to share ideas with you, Mr. President.\nAnd I especially enjoyed our time that Jill and I and Brigitte had last night and our visit. First time I've gone to dinner—a private dinner in Washington in a long, long time. And—but I had the protection of the French Government with me. But—[laughter].\nBut all kidding aside, France is one of our strongest partners and historically—but one of our strongest partners and our most capable allies, and Emmanuel has also become a friend in addition to being President of that great country.\nAnd we share the same values and will remain the core, common agenda that we—address all challenges together. And occasionally, we have some slight differences, but never in a fundamental way, thus far—at least as long as I've been in Washington, and that's been more than a couple years.\nToday we reaffirmed that France and the United States, together with all our allied—all our NATO allies and European Union and the G-7 stand as strong as ever against Russia's brutal war against Ukraine. We talked a lot about that in our bilateral meeting. And we'll continue the strong support for the people of Ukraine as they defend their homes and their families and their sovereignty and territorial integrity against Russian aggression, which has been incredibly brutal.\nI knew Russia was, but I didn't anticipate them being as brutal as they have been in what they've been doing. Many of the reporters in this room have been there themselves and covered from there, and they know what it's like.\nToday we reaffirmed that, as I said, we're going to stand together against this brutality. And we'll continue the strong support for the Ukrainian people as they defend their homes and their families and their nurseries, their hospitals, their sovereignty, their integrity, and—against Russia aggression.\nAnd I want to thank you, Mr. President, for welcoming—that the people of France have given to over 100,000 Ukrainian refugees—it's a mark of who you are as a people, and—who have fleeing—or are fleeing Putin's, just, barbarism.\nPutin thinks that he can crush the will of all those who oppose his imperial ambitions. But attacking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, choking off energy to Europe to drive up prices, exacerbating food—a food crisis, that's hurting very vulnerable people not just in Ukraine, but around the world. And he's not going to succeed.\nPresident Macron and I have resolved that we're going to continue working together to hold Russia accountable for their actions and to mitigate the global impacts of Putin's war on the rest of the world.\nThe United States is helping Europe diversify away from Russian natural gas in the immediate term while accelerating our clean energy transitions, and we're going to continue working in close partnership with Europe as we move forward. I welcome the progress we've already made on many of these issues through the U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security. And today, we also committed to deepening cooperation between France and the United States on civil nuclear energy through our bilateral Clean Energy Partnership.\nAround the world, France and the United States are working to strengthen stability and security. We share the vision—the same vision in the Indo-Pacific. We're looking, for one, an Indo-Pacific that's free and open, prosperous and secure. And we're going to continue to strengthen our cooperation to defend core international principles in the Indo-Pacific, including freedom of navigation and freedom of overflight.\nWe're working together to support the Middle East that is more integrated, peaceful, and prosperous. And we wanted to particularly thank President Macron for his efforts to help bring about the historic maritime boundaries agreement between Israel and Lebanon.\nWe also stand with the people of Iran. And the French and the United States are working together to hold accountable those responsible for the human rights abuses, to counter Iran's support for the—Russia's war, and to ensure that Iran does not—does not, emphasize \"does not\"—ever acquire a nuclear weapon.\nAnd, as we in the United States are looking forward to hosting the upcoming U.S.-African Leaders Summit, President Macron and I understand Africa's influence and importance. And he has much to add—France has much to add.\nWe also are going to deepen our engagement, listening to and working with our African partners, to help strengthen the governance and security and economic opportunities across the continent and to tackle the global challenges of our time.\nOur partnership also extends to cooperating in outer space, from coordinating defenses and our—excuse me, from coordinating defense of our space activities to strengthening scientific efforts to monitor Earth's changing climate.\nAnd we're—we are—we had a detailed discussion of the Inflation Reduction Act. I know none of you are curious about that—[laughter]—but we did talk about that a good deal. The United States and Europe share the goal of making bold investments in clean energy to meet the challenges of the climate crisis and to build—and to build—the industries of the future, including batteries and green hydrogen.\nWe agreed to discuss practical steps to coordinate and align our approaches so that we can strengthen and secure the supply chains, manufacturing, and innovation on both sides of the Atlantic. We asked our teams to follow up on this part, as ongoing U.S.-EU consultation continues to—because we can work out some of the differences that exist, I'm confident.\nFrance and the United States are also leading efforts to strengthen the global health and global health security. President Macron's visits—visit falls on the World AIDS Day. And I want to particularly highlight our joint effort to reach our goal of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. That is a goal we set and a goal we're going to accomplish and the goal we're sticking with.\nAnd to do it, we have to—all the tools we need. We just have to make finishing this fight a top priority for not just the two of us, but for other nations as well.\nAnd that's why I'm proud to take the baton from you, President Macron, and host the Global Fund's Seventh Replenishment Conference this year, building on France's strong record of leadership. We've raised $15.7 billion with the United States and France as the two largest contributors to the Global Fund. And it's going to save millions—literally millions—of lives.\nIf I listed all the areas where cooperation between France and the United States was delivering—were delivering meaningful progress, we'd be here until dinnertime.\nBut so let me just close by highlighting our long-term investment to deepen the ties between our people, particularly the French—the U.S.-French Fulbright Program, which celebrates its 75th anniversary and has facilitated thousands of exchanges between our students and our educators over the last decades. That's been critical to our relationship. It's a key part of ensuring that the future of this vital alliance remain strong and vibrant for generations to come.\nSo, Emmanuel, thank you again for all that our nations are doing together and the cooperation. My administration has built our foreign policy around the strength of our alliances, and France is the very heart of that commitment.\nSomerci, my friend. And I look forward to continuing to work with you. And as I used to say in the body I worked in a long time, in the United States Senate, \"The floor is yours.\" [Laughter]\n[At this point, President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nWell, thank you, Emmanuel. I began to refer to him privately as my \"closer.\" [Laughter] That deal with Lebanon and Israel, we did negotiate, but we needed a closer to get the job done. And you did it. And thank you very much.\nAll right. We're going to take—we're each going to call on two people—a total of two people—a total of four, all told.\nAnd the first questioner is going to be from AFP, Ms. End [Aurelia End, Agence France-Presse].\nInflation Reduction Act/European Union-U.S Trade\nI'll answer the last question, since I didn't hear any of it. I didn't understand a word of it, so I'll answer it. [Laughter]\n[President Macron spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nNo, look, the United States makes no apology—and I make no apologies, since I wrote it for—the legislation you're talking about.\nBut there are occasions when you write a massive piece of legislation—and that has almost $368 billion dollars for the largest investment in climate change on all—of all of history. And so there's obviously going to be glitches in it and need to reconcile changes in it.\nFor example, there's a provision in it that says that there is the exception for anyone has a free trade agreement with us. Well, that was added by a Member of the United States Congress who acknowledges that he just meant allies; he didn't mean, literally, free trade agreement. So there's a lot we can work out.\nBut the essence of it is, we're going to make sure that the United States continues—and just as I hope Europe will be able to continue—not to have to rely on anybody else's supply chain. We're—we are our own supply chain, and we share that with Europe and all of our allies. And they will, in fact, have the opportunity to do the same thing.\nSo there's tweaks that we can make that can fundamentally make it easier for European countries to participate and/or be on their own. But that is something that is a matter to be worked out.\nThere is no fundamental—it was never intended, when I wrote the legislation—I never intended to exclude folks who were cooperating with us. That was not the intention.\nThe intention was to make sure we no longer were in a position—when there was a pandemic in Asia, and China decided they're going to no longer sell us computer chips. We invented the damn things, you know? [Laughter]\nSo it's—anyway—but my point is, we're back in business, Europe is back in business, and we're going to continue to create manufacturing jobs in America, but not at the expense of Europe.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nI'm confident. [Laughter] That's my answer. [Laughter]\nOkay, who's the next question? I've got my list here.\n[President Macron spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nIs it my turn to call on someone? Right?\nOkay, how about NPR, Tamara Keith.\nI love you guys. I negotiated a contract no one else could negotiate. The only thing that was left out was whether or not it was a paid leave.\nYou know I've been trying to get paid leave not just for rail workers, for everybody. But that other team—they're called the Republicans—they voted against it. They said we couldn't do it. We're one of the few nations in the world that don't have paid leave for our workers.\nAnd so what we're doing is—we can't afford to have—and by the way, in the meantime, they got a 43—45-percent increase in salary, et cetera. There's a lot of good things that happened in that.\nAnd if in fact this shuts down over the question of 1 to 5 paid—or 7 or 9 or whatever the number is that've been negotiating—of paid leave days, it's going to immediately cost 750,000 jobs and cause a recession.\nAnd so what I made really clear is that—what was negotiated was so much better than anything they ever had that it's worth—and they all signed on to it, by the way. There are only four unions that—out of the 13 or 14—that didn't agree. So the majority at the time it was—that I presented it, they asked me to do it. I presented it; they all signed on.\nBut here's the story: It doesn't mean because we are going to pass this, God willing, on—by Friday, by the time the—by the weekend that we're—that I'm going to back off of paid leave.\nI made it really clear: I'm going to continue to fight for paid leave for not only rail workers, but for all American workers. I suppose—I imagine it may surprise some of our European friends that there's no paid leave in the United States of America. We're one of the few major countries in the world that don't have it. It's about time.\nAnd so that's the context in which this all took place. And you know, and labor signed on to it as well, as you recall, initially. There were 4 unions out of the, I think, 13 or 14 that didn't like it.\nAnd—but I think we're going to get it done, but not within this agreement—not within this agreement. We're going to avoid the rail strike, keep the rails running, keep things moving, and I'm going to go back, and we're going to get paid leave not just for rail workers, but for all workers.\nLook, there is one way for this war to end the rational way: Putin to pull out of Ukraine. Number one. But it appears he's not going to do that. He's paying a very heavy price for failing to do it, but he's inflicting incredible, incredible carnage on the civilian population of Ukraine, bombing nurseries, hospitals, children's homes. It's sick what he's doing.\nBut the fact of the matter is, I have no immediate plans to contact Mr. Putin. Mr. Putin is—let me choose my words very carefully—I'm prepared to speak with Mr. Putin if in fact there is an interest in him deciding he's looking for a way to end the war. He hasn't done that yet. If that's the case, in consultation with my French and my NATO friends, I'll be happy to sit down with Putin to see what he wants—has in mind. He hasn't done that yet.\nIn the meantime, I think it's absolutely critical what Emmanuel said: We must support the Ukrainian people. The idea that Putin is ever going to defeat Ukraine is beyond comprehension. Imagine them trying to occupy that country through the next 2, 5, 10, 20 years if they could—if they could.\nHe's miscalculated every single thing he initially calculated. He thought he'd be greeted with open arms by the Russian-speaking portions of the Ukrainian population.\nGo back and read his speech when he invaded—when I said they were going to invade, and they did when we said they were. Go back and read the speech he made. He talked about him—with needing to be another Peter the Great. He talked about the need for the people—that Kyiv is the motherload of Russian identity in the beginning, et cetera, et cetera. He's just miscalculated across the board.\nAnd so the question is, what is his decision—how does he get himself out of the circumstance he's in? I'm prepared, if he's willing to talk, to find out what he's willing to do, but I'll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I'm not going to do it on my own.\nThank you.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThanks, folks. All right.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine", "Date": "2022-12-21", "Text": "Please, be seated. Thank you.\nPresident Zelenskyy, I'm honored to welcome you back to the White House.\nWe've spent an awful lot of time on the telephone as well as on video, but it's good to see you in person again. And we've been in close and frequent communication throughout this conflict from the very beginning, but particularly—it's particularly meaningful to talk with one another in person, look each other in the eye, because leadership through this terrible crisis has inspired the Ukrainian people—as you have done, Mr. President—and the American people and the entire world.\nThis visit to Washington, your first trip outside Ukraine since February, comes as President Putin is escalating his attacks—his brutal attacks—targeting critical infrastructure to make life as hard as possible for not only innocent Ukrainians, but children and young children and everything from orphanages to schools. It's just outrageous what he's doing.\nAnd we've—as we've heard into—and as we head into the new year, it's important for the American people and for the world to hear directly from you, Mr. President, about Ukraine's fight and the need to continue to stand together through 2023.\nThis visit also falls on the 300-day mark of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine. Three hundred days since Putin launched an unprovoked, unjustified, all-out assault on the free people of Ukraine. Three hundred days of Ukrainian people showing Russia and the world their steel backbone, their love of country, and their unbreakable determination—and I emphasize \"unbreakable determination\"—to choose their own path.\nTo Ukrainian people, I say to them all: You have demonstrated, you have shown, your strong stand against aggression in the face of the imperial appetites of autocrats who wrongfully believed you might—you might—they might be able to make might right, and they're not able to do it.\nThus far, they have not—they've stood alone. You know, and you've had—but you haven't stood alone. You have had significant, significant help. We've never stand alone—you will never stand alone.\nWhen Ukraine's freedom was threatened, the American people—like generations of Americans before us—did not hesitate. The support from all across this country, Americans of every walk of life—Democrats and Republicans alike—had the resources and the—to rebound in resounding, united way to do—provide unequivocal and unbending support for Ukraine.\nBecause we understand in our bones that Ukraine's fight is part of something much bigger. The American people know that if we stand by in the face of such blatant attacks on liberty and democracy and the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the world would surely face worse consequences.\nAnd as I said when Putin rolled his tanks into Ukraine in February: American people are prepared to have us stand up to bullies, stand up for freedom. That's who we are as Americans. And that's exactly what we've done.\nEven before the invasion began and Putin threatened Ukraine by building up his forces, we helped make sure Ukraine would be prepared to defend itself, even before they crossed into Ukraine. We provided a steady stream of defensive weapons, including air defense systems and artillery, ammunition, and so much more. And we've not done it alone.\nFrom the very beginning, the United States rallied allies and partners from around the world to stand strong with Ukraine and impose unprecedented—and I emphasize \"unprecedented\"—sanctions and export controls on Russia, making it harder for the Kremlin to wage this brutal war.\nMore than 50 nations have committed nearly 2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles; more than 800 artillery systems; more than 2 million rounds of artillery ammunition; and more than 50 advanced multiple rocket launching systems; antiship and anti- —and air defense systems all to strengthen Ukraine.\nTogether, we've provided billions of dollars in direct budgetary support to make sure the Ukrainian Government can keep providing basic, fundamental services to the Ukrainian people like health care, education, and emergency personnel.\nThis includes another $2 billion that—in direct budget support from the American people that the World Bank distributed earlier this week. We've provided humanitarian assistance to help the millions of Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes because of Putin's inhumane, brutal war. Communities across Europe have opened their hearts and their homes to help Ukrainians in need.\nThe United States has been proud to welcome more than 221,000 Ukrainians seeking refuge since March of 2022, including as part of Uniting for Ukraine—as part of our Uniting for Ukraine program.\nAnd today USAID is committing more than $374 million in urgently needed humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. This will help provide food and cash assistance for more than 1.5 million Ukrainian people, as well as access to health care, safe drinking water, and help stay warm in the winter to more than—for more than 2.5 million Ukrainians.\nThe United States and our allies and partners around the world have delivered a broad range of assistance at historic speed, and it's been critical to bolstering Ukraine's success thus far. Ukraine has won the battle of Kyiv, has won the battle of Kherson, has won the battle of Kharkiv. Ukraine has defied Russia's expectations at every single turn.\nAnd, President Zelenskyy, you have made it clear he is open to pursuing a—well, let me put it this way: He's not open, but you're open to pursuing peace. You're open to pursuing a just peace.\nWe also know that Putin has no intention—no intention—of stopping this cruel war. And the United States is committed to ensuring that the brave Ukrainian people can continue—continue to defend their country against Russian aggressions as long as it takes.\nAnd I want to thank the Members of Congress and their—for their broad bipartisan support to Ukraine. And I look forward to signing the omnibus bill soon, which includes $45 billion—$45 billion—in additional funding for Ukraine.\nI will also sign into law the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes authorities for—to make it easier for the Department of Defense to procure critical munitions and defense materials for Ukraine and other key materials to strengthen our national security.\nToday I'm announcing the next tranche of our security assistance to Ukraine: $1.85 billion package of security assistance that includes both direct transfers of equipment to—that Ukraine needs, as well as contracts to supply ammunition Ukraine will need in the months ahead for its artillery, its tanks, and its rocket launchers.\nCritically, in addition to these new capabilities like precision aerial munitions, the package will include a Patriot missile battery, which will—and on which we'll train Ukrainian forces to operate as part of the ongoing effort to help bolster Ukraine's air defense. It's going to take some time to complete the necessary training, but the Patriot battery will be another critical asset for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression.\nAltogether, today's new security assistance, with humanitarian funding, amounts to $2.2 billion in additional support for the Ukrainian people.\nWe should be clear about what Russia is doing. It is purposefully attacking Ukraine's critical infrastructure, destroying the systems that provide heat and light to Ukrainian people during the coldest, darkest part of the year. Russia is using winter as a weapon: freezing people, starving people, cutting them off from one another. It's the latest example of the outrageous atrocities that Russian forces are committing against innocent Ukrainian civilians, children and their families.\nAnd the United States is working together with our allies and partners to provide critical equipment to help Ukraine make emergency repairs to their power transmission systems and strengthen the stability of Ukraine's grid in the face of Russia's targeted attacks.\nWe're also working to hold Russia accountable, including efforts in Congress that will make it easier to seek justice for Russia's war crimes in Ukraine.\nLet me close with this: Tonight is the fourth nights of—night of Hanukkah, a time when Jewish people around the world—President Zelenskyy and many of the families among them—honor the timeless miracle of a small band of warriors fighting for their values and their freedom against a much larger foe and how they endured and how they overcame; how the flame of faith, with only enough oil for 1 day, burned brightly for 8 days.\nA story of survival and resilience that reminds us that the coldest days of the year, that light will always prevail over darkness and hope drives away despair; and that the human spirit is unconquerable as long as there are good people willing to do what is right.\nThis year has brought so much needless suffering and loss to the Ukrainian people. But I want you to know, President Zelenskyy—I want you to know that—all the people of Ukraine to know as well: The American people have been with you every step of the way, and we will stay with you. We will stay with you for as long as it takes.\nWhat you're doing, what you've achieved, it matters not just to Ukraine, but to the entire world. And together, I have no doubt we'll keep the flame of liberty burning bright, and the light will remain and prevail over the darkness.\nThank you for being here, Mr. President. We're going to stand with you.\nThank you very much, Mr. President.\nWe're going to take questions from four different reporters. I'm going to start with Alex [Alexander Nazaryan] of Yahoo! News.\nWell, in answering your questions first, I'm not at all worried about holding the alliance together in NATO and European Union, as well as other nations.\n[The Ukrainian translation of President Biden's remarks was fed over the English line.]\nI assume this is simultaneous?\nAll right. [Laughter]\nOkay. I've never seen NATO or the EU more united about anything at all. And I see no sign of there being any change.\nWe all know what's at stake here; our European partners all the more so. They fully understand it. This is about—we've never seen a major invasion of a European country since World War II. And they see no signs of it—that Putin is going to do anything to change that unless we resist and we help the Ukrainians resist.\nWe all know what's at stake: the very idea of sovereignty, the U.N. Charter. Putin thought he would weaken NATO; instead, he strengthened NATO. I once said to him that if he talked about the—he wanted—wanted to see the, you know, Europe end up being divided. The—and instead, what did he do? He produced a more united Europe, with Sweden and Finland joining.\nSo I don't see any reason to believe there will be any lessening of support. And as we reach out to our NATO allies—our Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State—we get continued support. And not only there, but also from around the world, from Japan and many other countries as well. So I feel very good about the solidarity of support for Ukraine.\n[President Zelenskyy made remarks in English as follows.]\nYou call on one of your people? A press person?\nWe will.\nYour guy. [Laughter]\nAlthough, I like him very much already. [Laughter]\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nLet me respond. I think we have the—we share the exact same vision, and that a free, independent, prosperous, and secure Ukraine is the vision.\nWe both want this war to end. We both want it to end. And as I've said, it could end today if Putin had any dignity at all and did the right thing and just said—pulled out. But that's not going to happen. Not going to happen. It's not going to happen now.\nSo what comes next? What we talked about today was, we're going to continue to help Ukraine succeed on the battlefield. It can succeed in the battlefield with our help and the help of our European allies and others, so that if and when President Zelenskyy is ready to talk with the Russians, he will be able to succeed as well, because he will have won on the battlefield.\nAnd you know, I don't think we should underestimate the impact this war is having on Russia and the losses they're suffering. And you saw just—I think it was 2 days ago—Putin saying that this is much tougher than he thought.\nHe thought he could break NATO. He thought he could break the West. He thought he could break the alliance. He thought he could be welcomed by the Ukrainian people that were Russian-speaking. He was wrong, wrong, and wrong. He continues to be wrong. The sooner he makes it—it's clear that he cannot possibly win this war, that's when—the time we have to put the—this President in a position to be able to decide how he wants the war to end.\nMy turn, huh? [Laughter]\nPhil Mattingly of—Mattingly of CNN.\nUkraine-U.S. Relations/Russia\nLet me answer the first question—the first part of your question. You know, I get kidded for saying that there's—all politics is personal. It's all about looking someone in the eye. And I mean it sincerely.\nI don't think there's any, any, any substitute for sitting down face to face with a friend or a foe and looking them in the eye. And that's exactly what's happening at this moment. We've done that more than once, and we're going to continue to do it.\nAnd the winter is setting in, and Putin is increasingly going after civilian targets and women and children, orphanages. This guy is—well—but he's going to fail. And he's going to fail. He's already failed, because he now knows that there's no way he's ever going to occupy all of Ukraine. There's no way in which he's going to be accepted by the Ukrainian people.\nAnd so he's failed in the past. And it was very important for him and everyone else to see that President Zelenskyy and I are united, two countries together, to make sure he cannot succeed.\nAnd I think—I may be mistaken, but I know—I judge every leader by the way they—what they say to me, their consistency, and looking me in the eye.\n[President Biden pointed to President Zelenskyy.]\n——has in his—to his very soul is who he says he is. It's clear who he is. He's willing to give his life for his country and all the folks who are with—came with him today.\nAnd so I think it's—he—it's important for him to know we are going to do everything in our power—everything in our power—to see that he succeeds.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]\nWhat was the second part of your question?\nI did not discuss that at all with the President. But I—we do not—it's a defensive system. It's a defensive weapon system. It's not escalatory. It's defensive. And it's easy to not—and we'd love to not have to have them use it. Just stop the attacks.\nWe're working on it.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]\nWell, the—his answer is yes. [Laughter]\n[President Biden pointed to President Zelenskyy, who spoke in English as follows.]\nLet me be straightforward with you here. Look, the fact is that it's important to remember that before Russia invaded, we had dedicated an enormous amount of security assistance to Ukraine. And we've given Ukraine what they needed when they needed to defend themselves. And since the invasion, that has resulted in more than $20 billion, in terms of security assistance.\nJust today I approved another $1.8 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine for it to succeed on the battlefield. And we're focused on working with allies and partners to generate capability in four key areas: Air defense. As know—as we know today, the Patriot is the best of that. Secondly is to—and we're looking to do more. We provided hundreds of advanced artillery systems and dozens—from dozens of countries. Thirdly, we've worked with partners to get Ukraine tanks and other armored vehicles. And fourthly, we've announced today another 200,000 rounds of additional ammunition.\nNow, you say, \"Why don't we just give Ukraine everything there is to give?\" Well, for two reasons. One, there's an entire alliance that is critical to stay with Ukraine. And the idea that we would give Ukraine material that is fundamentally different than is already going there would have a prospect of breaking up NATO and breaking up the European Union and the rest of the world.\nWe're going to give Ukraine what it needs to be able to defend itself, to be able to succeed, and succeed in the battlefield.\nAnd the other piece of this is, you may recall, one of the reasons why I have spent—well, I won't tell you the calculation, but I've spent several hundred hours face to face with our European allies and the heads of state of those countries, and making the case as to why it was overwhelmingly in their interest that they continue to support Ukraine.\nThey understand it fully, but they're not looking to go to war with Russia. They're not looking for a third World War. And I think it can all be avoided by making sure that Ukraine is able to succeed in the battlefield.\nSo, anyway, there's more to say, but I probably already said too much. Thank you.\nWell, thank you all very, very much. I appreciate your time and attention.\nAnd as I said, Mr. President, you don't have to worry: We are staying with Ukraine as long as Ukraine is there.\nThank you all.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico", "Date": "2023-01-10", "Text": "Thank you very much. It's wonderful to be back here in Mexico City. And I want to thank you, Mr. President, for hosting the Prime Minister and me for the 10th North American Leaders' Summit. This is a magnificent fora.\nAnd we're true partners, the three of us, working together with mutual respect and a genuine like for one another to advance a safer and more prosperous future for all of our people. And the reason for this summit and this trilateral relationship are so impactful is because we share a common vision for the future, grounded on common values—and I mean that sincerely—common values we share in our countries.\nSince becoming President, I've been laser-focused on rebuilding the U.S. economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the trickle-down economy. Because the bottom up and the middle out, it works, because the wealthy do very well and everybody else does well too, but everybody does well. And \"from the bottom up\" is—means investing in priorities for working families.\nAnd the United States has made historic, bipartisan investments in infrastructure and innovation that are already beginning to deliver concrete benefits for the American people, and, I would argue, it will ultimately reap benefits for the entire North America. We've renewed our dependence—our deep—and deepened our cooperation for—of the closest friends and allies, none closer than Mexico and Canada, to take on the biggest challenges facing the region and, quite frankly, the world.\nBecause there can no longer be any question—none—in today's interconnected world. We cannot wall ourself off from shared problems. We are stronger and better when we work together, the three of us. And together, we've made enormous progress since our last summit, from COVID—fighting COVID-19 and strengthening our ability to address public health threats, to investing in and building a 21st-century workforce.\nAt the top of our shared agenda today is keeping the—North America the most competitive, prosperous, and resilient economic region of the world. And the strength of our economic relationship among our nations not only supports good-paying jobs in all of our countries, but it generates tremendous growth. Now we're working to a future to strengthen our cooperation on supply chains and critical minerals so we can continue accelerating our efforts to build the technologies of tomorrow right here in North America.\nThis summit—this summit—also builds on the continual consultation and cooperation with one another to take on the challenges that impact all three of our nations.\nOur entire hemisphere is experiencing unprecedented levels of migration, greater than any time in history. And North America—at the North America Summit Leader in—hosted in Washington in 2021, we launched the idea of a regional-wide approach—a regional-wide approach to a regional-wide problem. The idea grew into the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection, which 21 countries ultimately adopted at the Summit of the Americas 6 months ago.\nAnd we're working together, especially with our North American partners, to fulfill our commitments under that declaration. They include the policy I announced last week to expand safe and legal pathways for immigrants from Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti that were seeking a better life here in the United States of America.\nWe also want to thank you, Mr. President, for stepping up to receive into Mexico those not following the lawful pathways we've made available, instead of—attempting to unlawfully cross the border between our countries.\nOn my way here, I stopped in El Paso, Texas, to see the situation with my own eyes and to meet with U.S. border security officials. It's putting real strain on the communities in both Mexico and the United States. We're working together to address this challenge in a way that upholds our nations' laws and protects the human rights of migrants facing desperate circumstances.\nWe're also working together to take on the scourge of human smuggling and illegal drug trafficking. In just the last 6 months, our joint patrols in Mexico have resulted in the arrest of more than 7,000—7,000—human smugglers. And we've seized more than 20,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl at the border. And today we've discussed how all three of us can continue to deepen and strengthen our shared efforts to cut off the flow of illegal fentanyl, including by tackling the precursor chemicals used in synthetic drugs as we go after the laboratories where they're made and the stash houses where they're stored.\nWe also talked about meeting our commitments to make North America a clean energy powerhouse—and I believe that's within our grasp—and a global leader in addressing the climate crisis.\nThat means working together to promote zero-emissions vehicles, to build charging stations for electric vehicles that are compatible across our international borders. It means exploring shared markets for clean hydrogen. And it means working together to meet our ambitious commitments under the Paris Agreement, including tackling methane and black carbon.\nAnd finally, as three vibrant democracies, we recognize our greatest strength is our people. Let me say that again: Vital democracies we are, and our greatest strength are our people, the strength of our people.\nAnd a key to our competitive edge in the world is our incredible diversity. So, together, we're working to address the inequities that for too long have plagued historically marginalized communities in each of our nations to make sure everyone gets a fair shot. It's one of the smartest investments we can make for our future, and we're going to make it together.\nSo, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister, I'm honored to stand with you today. And I am grateful to have both of you as partners and, I might add, friends as we work together to realize a shared vision for North America.\nThank you very much.\nAll right. I was having trouble hearing, but I'd like to call on Associated Press, Colleen Long, for the first question.\nI'll answer first?\nWell, let me get rid of the easy one first. People know I take classified documents and classified information seriously.\nWhen my lawyers were clearing out my office at the University of Pennsylvania, they set up an office for me—a secure office in the Capital, when I—the 4 years after being Vice President, I was a professor at Penn.\nThey found some documents in a box—you know, a locked cabinet, or at least a closet. And as soon as they did, they realized there were several classified documents in that box. And they did what they should have done: They immediately called the Archives—immediately called the Archives—turned them over to the Archives. And I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any Government records that were taken there to that office.\nBut I don't know what's in the documents. I've—my lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were. I've turned over the boxes—they've turned over the boxes to the Archives. And we're cooperating fully—cooperating fully—with the review, and—which I hope will be finished soon, and will be more detail at that time.\nThe first question, now I forgot. [Laughter] No. Your first question related to——\nI'm only joking.\nThe answer is—the answer is, you've got both—both the extremes are wrong. It's a basic middle proposition.\nNow, look, as was mentioned by all of us in one way or another, this has been the greatest migration in human history around the world, as well as in this hemisphere. And when I got elected, the first thing I—the first major piece of legislation I introduced was to reform the immigration process, to make it more orderly, to make it more—to make sure people have access under the law.\nAnd so what we found out—and not just in my visit to El Paso, but before that—we found out is that our Republican friends and some—a few Democrats—are very critical of what's going on at the border, but yet refuse to even look at the detail document I submitted for the Congress to consider to reform the process completely.\nAnd so, number one, right now a majority of our migrants are coming from four countries: Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua. And we're expanding the very successful parole program we had, with regard to Venezuela, to Cuba and to Nicaragua and to Haiti to provide safe and orderly and humane processing for people fleeing those countries to come to the United States and claiming under the—seeking asylum.\nThis is going to reduce the number of people legally trying to cross—illegally trying to cross the border. Venezuelans were trying to enter the country. That they dropped—that has dropped off dramatically because we've allowed them to go directly to whatever country—the first country they go to, directly contact the United States, make sure that they make their application showing that they have—they do a background check; they, in fact, have access to a sponsor; and that they have been—they've been examined. And that way, they're able to come through ports of entry.\nAnd it's dropped off—we have—I'm going to make sure I get the numbers right—dramatically from 1,100 persons trying to enter to—per day—to 250 a day.\nI've asked the—and I want to thank the President of Mexico for agreeing to take up to 3,000 people back in as—that don't meet this criteria. Because, look, right now the cartels make a lot of money, which they use for drug trafficking as well. People go through—have to make it through jungles and a long journey to the border. And many are victimized, not only in terms of what they have to pay, but victimized physically in other ways.\nAnd so we're trying to make it easier for people to get here, opening up the capacity to get here, but not have them go through that God-awful process.\nAnd we're going to continue our efforts to address the root causes of migration to help people stay in their home countries. I've asked the Congress for $4 billion to provide for that. We've also had our Vice President provide for private donations of over $3 billion to make sure that people—look, all of you know all of us in the United States are immigrants. Mine go all the way back to the Irish famine. But the point is, all of us have been immigrants.\nAnd one of the things that comes across fairly clearly is, it's not like people sit in their home city, county, town and say: \"I've got a great idea. Let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, go through some jungles and a long path up to the United States, smuggle us across the border, drop us in a desert. And won't that be fun in a country we don't even speak the language?\"\nWe have—we can do more than merely just make legal immigration more streamlined. But we can also do it by preventing people from wanting to have to leave in the first place, by helping their communities, in fact, better their circumstances.\nAnd so I hope—you know, and by the way, my proposals are supported by the Chamber of Commerce, by the American labor movement, not—I mean, which is an unusual coalition—and a whole range of people. The point here is that my Republican friends in Congress should join us in the solutions.\nAnd the one last point I'll make—and I'm sorry to go on so long, but we spent a lot of time talking about it—is we have to increase the technological capabilities at the border, both to intercept illegal drugs and other contraband, as well as people being smuggled across the border.\nWe have now the ability to use, and use—some of you have seen them; I know you all, you have, I'm sure—these trucks that ride alongside of a tractor trailer. It's like a giant X-ray machine, and it can determine what's inside that tractor-trailer. And thousands cross the border every day in illegal commerce. And so we're allowed to determine whether or not there—fentanyl is in there, drugs in there, people being smuggled across the border.\nWe're going to provide significantly more of those vehicles for the people to be able to determine at the border what need—what—what is coming across legally and illegally.\nA lot more to say, but I probably already said too much. Thank you.\nI want the record to show: I don't know what questions I didn't answer. I'm prepared later. Thank you very much.

{"Title": "Interview with Judy Woodruff of CBS News in Madison, Wisconsin", "Date": "2023-02-08", "Text": "Happy to be here.\nFrom the folks who did it, I was. The vast majority of Republicans weren't that way. But, you know, there's still a significant element of what I call the MAGA Republicans, you know, the 'Make America Great Again' Republicans. And it's you know, I didn't. I kind of anticipated but there are an awful lot of — The speaker was gracious and so was you know, there were a lot of members.\nWell, you know, as you know, Judy, I spent most of my career with the Congress and members of the Congress. I know, I know the place well. I know the system well. And I always feel comfortable when I'm up on the Hill, for real. Did most of my life. Wasn't too bad at it either.\nThere's a lot more than that. It's going to make a gigantic difference. Look, we've already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Just in two years. That's more jobs than anyone's created anyway. And and we paid for it all. We actually reduce the debt, the deficit, by $1.7 trillion over two years. And what it's about is about giving working folks a chance. And I don't mean just labor. I mean, look, you've probably heard me say before, I've never been a big fan of trickle down economics. Family I was raised in, a lot didn't trickle down to our table. But, you know, the middle class, when it does well, everybody does well. So my goal was when I got elected was to campaign on this bill from the bottom up in the middle out. When that happens, the poor have a chance up and the middle class does well and the wealthy always do well. So.\nWell it will have a profound effect. I mean, look, all just as I was told we were going to lose big the last election, the off-year election, I said we weren't. Just as we were told I wasn't going to be able to pass Inflation Reduction Act or the CHIP. We passed them all. And and what's happening now is people don't understandably, don't realize all of our past back in June, July, August to September, and is only coming to fruition now. For example, Judy, we pay the highest drug prices of any nation in the world, yet people didn't know until January, even though we talked about it since last summer, that prescription drugs costs were going to go down and, for example, insulin. Insulin for seniors instead of being four or five hundred bucks a month is now $35 a month. And people are going, 'whoa'. And there's so much more to come. And look, I think we start off with the proposition — I do anyway — that the vast majority of Americans don't think the tax system is fair. I mean, the vast majority, including, you know, wealthy, well-off suburbanites. And the idea you got a thousand trillionaires and they pay less for the percentage of their income than a schoolteacher does. I mean, so there's a lot going on. We got a lot passed and its now just they're going to start to roll out.\nBecause the polls don't matter anymore. You got to make, what, 40, 50 calls and on a cell phone to get someone to answer a poll? Even the pollsters, you talk to them. Ask them what they think about this. Look.\nOh, I know the policy. By the way, if you ask the same things. Do they support the rebuilding infrastructure America? Overwhelmingly support. Ask anybody. Do they support the CHIPS and Science Act where we've attracted $300 billion in investments? We invented these chips. They're coming back to America. We're going to be the leaders again. When you ask them about whether or not they think they're paying too much, too much for drug prices. Overwhelmingly, yes. So it's all just like, look, people went through hell the last several years, the last five years in the pandemic. We lost a million people, dead. And so every time you turn on the news, are you reporting any positive news, I'm not I'm not meaning you personally, editorially. So you turn on the television and everything's down. And so people understandably are down.\nWell, I think it's a number of reasons. Number one, I think that we. There was a deliberate effort by the last guy to play on people's fears and to appeal to base instincts. I mean, and it's just it's not who we are, but people are — you know, I also noticed a fair amount of Republicans standing up last night and clapping. You know, for example, when I pointed out that some Republicans are talking about eliminating Medicare. They said, 'no, no, no.' I said oh, okay. That means all of you are for supporting Medicare? Everybody raise your hand. They all raised their hand. So guess what? We accomplished something. Unless they break their word. There are going to be no cuts in Medicare, Social Security. My point is, I think it's the way we talk to each other. And I think, you know, look, I think what happened was that the party started to take for granted ordinary blue collar workers. And they really got hurt. They got hurt the previous four or five years and everything went wrong in their lives. Look at all the factories that have closed and left you know, the United States. Look at all the things that have happened. But they're coming back now. And I've just gotta to make sure everybody knows what we've done. Watch how it unfolds and see what happens.\nI don't think it was better or worse. I think what happened was then we had a different set of problems, but we didn't have many people playing on the fears of the American people. There was just genuine debate about and discord about the war in Vietnam. The civil rights movement, which got me involved in politics in the first place, was just reaching a culmination point where we really began to pass the Civil Rights Act and a number of things. So I think it's a process. And I think that most Americans are of the view that we've got this. It's gotten too mean. It's gotten too, too personal and too divisive. And I think one of the things — the message they sent this last election was 'come on, work together, get something done for us.'\nI think.\nI think the American public, I think when we vote on whether or not to extend the Medicare benefit, I mean, health care benefits to ordinary Americans, not just on Medicare and Medicaid. I think we will see that. We say that insulin should be available for 35 bucks for every American out there. I think you're going to see a lot of things done because people are becoming aware of what we can do, and we're starting to see those things happening. And one of the reasons I'm here at this facility, you know, the laborers now, most people think that, you know, we're going to be a laborer. Well, you just sign up, you show up. They have four years apprenticeships to become a laborer. It's like going to college again, not again. So going to college. We're the best trained workers in the world. And for example, when I asked the.\nI know I can.\nPublic's not going to pay attention that. They want these guys to do something. If the only thing they can do is make up things about my family. It's not going to go very far.\nHe's an impressive guy, isn't he?\nI know. I talked to him.\nXi JinPing before. I in our team talks to their people.\nAfter, I haven't talked to him during this. But, look, I mean, the idea of shooting down a balloon that's gathering information over America and, that makes relations worse? Look, I made it real clear to Xi Jinping that we're going to compete fully with China, but we're not looking for conflict. And and that's been the case so far. China wants very, has… Let me put it another way as I said, you can think of any other, and you're very informed in foreign policy, can you think of any other world leader who would trade places with Xi Jinping? Not a joke. You think of any who would? I can't think of one. This man has enormous problems. Enormous. He has also great potential. But so far, he has an economy that's not functioning very well. He's in a situation where he is — for example, you know, everybody assumed that China would be all in with Russia and Ukraine. But they're not all in it. As a matter of fact I called him this summer to say this is not a threat, just an observation: look what's happened to Russia. 600 American corporations have pulled out of Russia. From McDonald's to Exxon. And I said, You've told me all along that the reason why you need a relationship with the United States in Europe is so they invest in China. So who's going to invest in China if you engage in the same kind of deal? You notice there's not been much going on there.\nIt's a firm commitment. Look, when is the last… If these guys, Jordan or whoever you mentioned. The idea that the Russian military, with over a hundred thousand forces would invade and try to maraud Ukraine, and us stand by and do nothing. Come on? And what I've done, and I think I'm very proud of it, I've been able to unite NATO completely. He was convinced NATO would collapse. NATO would not be engaged. I've been able to get our our Asian allies to join with the Europeans in terms of taking on Russia, whether or not. So I mean, we are, we have a better relationship and tighter control over our destiny now than we've ever had. And, you know, we have Germany increasing our budget by over 2%. You have Japan doing the same thing. I mean, I just don't — I mean, if these guys don't want to help Ukraine, I get it. They don't want to do that. But what are they going to do when Ukraine rolls, when Russia rolls across Ukraine or into Belarus or anywhere else?\nYeah, it is. Look, there's no way that Putin is going to be able to cope. He's already lost Ukraine. The idea that he's ever going to be able — Well, here's what he thought. He thought that if he invaded Ukraine, first of all, he'd get a welcome by every Russian speaker, they'd say, 'come on in.' And secondly, he thought what would happen is that NATO would collapse. NATO would not do anything. They'd be afraid to act. Then he thought anyway, go down the line. None of that's happening.\nWhat they've informed me not to speak to this issue to anyway, try to prejudice the investigation that's going on. But what I was talking about was what was laid out. All these documents were a top secret, code word and all the rest. And I'm not at liberty and I'm not even sure, I made voluntarily — no one's had to threaten to do anything — voluntarily opened every single aperture I have in the house, offices, everything. For them to come and look and spend hours searching my home. Invited them. Nobody. And so, in the best of my knowledge, the kinds of things they picked up were things that from 1974 and stray papers. There may be something else, I don't know. But one of the things that happened is that what was not done well is as they packed up my offices to move them, they didn't do the kind of job that should have been done to go thoroughly through every single piece of literature that's there. But, I'll just let the investigation, you know, decide what's going on and we'll see what happens.\nWatch me. It's all I can say. I mean, you know, it goes from one extreme to the other. Last night I was — I heard that people are saying, Well, just watch Biden, my God, age is not an issue anymore. Look, I'm a great respector of fate. I would be completely, thoroughly honest with the American people if I thought there was any health problem, anything that would keep me from being able to do the job. And and, so we'll see. But, you know, I just — I think people have to just watch me.\nI haven't made that decision. That's my intention, I think. But I haven't made that decision firmly yet.\nThank you, Judy. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-judy-woodruff-cbs-news-madison-wisconsin"}
{"Title": "Interview with David Muir of ABC News", "Date": "2023-02-24", "Text": "Well, that depends on what the Ukrainians decide. But here's what we have to do in the meantime. We have to put the Ukrainians in a position where they can make advances this spring and summer and move to a place where negotiation, they can negotiate from a position of strength. And, but, you know, that expression event heard me use before and others, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. We're not going to dictate to them what the end result is.\nThat means they decide that. They, the Ukrainians, decide that. But I could picture a circumstance where there's a transition to that. It's not all one time. Look, a year ago today, they were only 70 kilometers from the border where Russians expected to come rolling down into Kyiv and own it all. They got pushed back. It didn't happen. And I think they underestimated a great deal, the Russians did.\nWell, first of all, I'm not sure how many are asking that. I know the MAGA crowd is. The right-wing Republicans are, you know, talking about, we can't do this. We find ourselves in a situation where the cost of doing, walking away could be considerably higher than the cost of helping Ukraine maintain its independence.\nLook, we're sending him what our seasoned military thinks he needs now. He needs tanks, he needs artillery, he needs air defense, including another HIMAR. But there are things he needs now that we're sending him to put him in a position to be able to make gains this spring and this summer going into the fall.\nNo, he doesn't need F-16s now.\nLook, first of all, the idea that we know exactly what's going to be needed a year or two, three from now, but there is no basis upon which there is a rationale according to our military now to provide F-16s.\nI am ruling it out for now.\nLook, it's not on China's, I had a very frank conversation with President Xi this past summer on this issue. And I pointed out to him, the conversation went like this. I said, Mr. President this is not a threat, it's an assertion, a statement what I think the reality is. You saw what happened when the rest of the world, Europe in particular, saw the brutality of what Putin was doing in Ukraine, to the Ukrainians from Russia. And I said, without any government prodding, 600 American corporations left Russia, from McDonald's to Exxon, to across the board. And I said, and if you are engaged in the same kind of brutality by supporting the brutality that's going on, I said, you may face the same consequence. I don't anticipate, we haven't seen it yet, but I don't anticipate a major initiative on the part of China providing weaponry to, to Russia.\nIt would be the same line everyone else would have crossed. In other words, we'd impose severe sanctions on anyone who has done that.\nI'll let you characterize what they would be. We would respond.\nUS intelligence is aware of everything that's going on in this area, but I'm not going to confirm specifically what US intelligence has found out or not found out.\nI think you answered the question. Putin is applauding it, so how could it be any good? I'm not being facetious. I'm being deadly earnest. I've seen nothing in the plan that would indicate that there is something that would be beneficial to anyone other than Russia if the Chinese plan were followed. The idea that China is going to be negotiating the outcome of a war that's a totally unjust war for Ukraine is just not rational.\nIt is almost not relevant once it was over the United States.\nThere is a possibility of that.\nThat's what that balloon does, surveillance.\nYes. There should be a direct open line of communications, particularly from two most powerful nations in the world to be able to resolve anything quickly so there's not a mistake made.\nWe make it clear that it's necessary for that to occur. We can't fix it.\nLet's put this in perspective. Within two hours of that derailment, the EPA was in there, within two hours. Every major agency in the United States government that had anything to do with rail and/or cleanup was there and is there. In addition to that, I've spoken at length to the congresspersons, the governors, the senators from both states of Pennsylvania and, and in Ohio, and I've made it clear to them anything they need is available or will make it available. Whatever happens, you've got to understand, it's the responsibility of the railroad company who's made, by the way, tens of billions of dollars in profits. Tens of billions of dollars in profits lately.\nI can't recall. I don't think aye I've talked to the mayor there. I've talked to both the senators, both governors, everyone there is to talk to, and we made it clear that everything is available.\nWell, apparently, someone interviewed my wife today I heard.\nI got to call her and find out. No, all kidding aside. My intention from the beginning has been from the beginning to run, but there's too many other things I have to finish in the near term before I started campaigning.\nI say, God love her. Yeah. Look, I meant what I said. I've got other things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.\nNo. But it's legitimate for people to raise questions about my age. It's totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, watch me.\nI've been advised by the counsel, let the Justice Department make that decision, to not try to alter the case in any way. There have been very few documents that have been confiscated, found in my possession that were in other than in my possession, meaning in my home. All the stuff that was moved out of my Senate office over the years, I'm told there were a couple of things from 1973 or '74 documents were marked classified. I don't know of anything maybe, I don't know of anything that is marked like it was, top secret, highly et cetera. But I'm told not to comment on that, because I don't even know what they were able to, what they confiscated.\nBecause they were showing, you guys were showing on television things lying on the ground that said top secret, national, you know, code word. And the difference is, every single solitary thing I have been asked to do, I've done voluntarily. I've invited the Justice Department to come into every aspect of any place that I had any control off. There was no need for search warrants, no need, what do you need? Just come. Whatever you want. Whatever you want, wherever you want to go, you can go. That was totally different.\nYou know, you're a good lawyer, but you're trying to make a comparison. What, there's degrees of irresponsibility. They can be significant degrees of irresponsibility. What, the way in which the boxes were packed up from my office, apparently not everything was gone through as meticulously as it should have, but there was no intention. I opened up my home, all my homes the home at the beach and the home that I, my permanent home. And they spent hours and hours going through everything, personal everything I had. And that's a fundamentally different thing. There's nothing for me to hide.\nNo, but it's legitimate for people to raise issues about my age. It's totally legitimate to do that. And the only thing I can say is, watch me.\nWell, look, I think it goes well beyond the economy. Think about it. You make the – I mean you interview for the news. Can you think of anything you turn on the television and go, God, that makes me feel good? Almost anything? Everything is in the negative. We're also finding out now that one of the outlets has decided that they even put things on they know to be false in order to increase their ratings. So, I think things are a little out of whack. And I don't blame people for being down. You know, when you had a year, two years of the pandemic, kids out of school, the mental health problems in the country are seriously increased, especially among young people. Some things are, for example, even feeling down about unemployment. They've got better jobs, are making more money. Inflation is still higher than it should be, and, you know, everything from gasoline prices, to a war going on in Ukraine. I mean, so I can't think of a time when there's been a greater uncertainty, notwithstanding the fact we're created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We're better off than virtually any other major nation in the world, economically. But it's understandable why people are just down.\nIt's a big mistake to do that. Not very responsible. And, but I don't read into that that he's thinking of using nuclear weapons or anything like that. I think it's a, I'm not sure what else he was able to say in a speech at the moment. But I think it's a mistake. And I'm confident we'll be able to work it out.\nWell, look. I think we're less safe when we walk away from arms control agreements that are very much in both parties' interest, and the world's interest. But I've not seen anything, we've not seen anything, where there's a change in his posture and what they're doing. The idea that somehow this means they're thinking of using nuclear weapons, international continental ballistic missiles, there's no evidence of that.\nI didn't think it was that risky.\nNot 20 hours' worth, though.\nWell, look, I think that's for, I'm not being facetious, folks like you decide how important that is. It was important to me to stand with Zelenskyy and let the world know, on the year anniversary, we're not walking away from Ukraine.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-david-muir-abc-news-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada in Ottawa, Canada", "Date": "2023-03-24", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister. And I can't think of a challenge we haven't met together when we sought to do it together.\n[President Biden cleared his throat.]\nExcuse me.\nAll right. I guess the first person I'm calling on is Josh [Josh Boak, AP]. Josh—[inaudible]. Josh.\nOh, sorry.\nI respond to the question first here?\nWell, first of all, look, in 10 years, Russia and China have had 40 meetings. Forty meetings.\nAnd I disagree with the basic premise of your question. I have—we have, you know, significantly expanded our alliances. I haven't seen that happen with China and/or Russia or anybody else in the world.\nWe're in a situation in the United States where NATO is stronger, we're all together—the G-7, the Quad, the ASEAN, Japan and Korea.\nI have—my staff pointed out to me: I have now met with 80 percent of the world leaders just since I've been President. We're the ones expanding the alliances. The opposition is not.\nName for me where that's going, and tell me what—I don't mean literally you, but rhetorically—tell me how, in fact, you see a circumstance where China has made some significant commitment to Russia. And what commitment can they make, economically? Economically.\nPardon me?\nYes, their trade has increased compared to what?\nLook—look, I don't take China lightly. I don't take Russia lightly. But I think we vastly exaggerate.\nI would hear—I've been hearing now for the past 3 months about \"China is going to provide significant weapons to Russia, and they're going to\"—you all have been talking about that. They haven't yet. Doesn't mean they won't, but they haven't yet.\nAnd if anything's happened, the West has coalesced significantly more. How about the Quad? How about Japan and the United States and South Korea? How about what we've done in terms of AUKUS? How about what we—I mean, so I just want to put it in perspective. I don't take it lightly what Japan—what China, excuse me, and Russia are doing. And it could get significantly worse.\nBut let's put it in perspective: We are uniting coalitions—we—we, the United States and Canada.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]\nPray.\nWell, no, I'm not disappointed. Look, this is a very, very difficult circumstance, the idea of how do we deal with what's going on in Haiti, where gangs have essentially taken the place of the Government, in effect. They run—they rule the roost, as the saying goes.\nAnd so I think that what the Prime Minister has spoken about makes a lot of sense. The biggest thing we could do, and it's going to take time, is to increase the prospect of the police departments in Haiti having the capacity to deal with the problems that are faced. And that is going to take a little bit of time.\nWe also are looking at whether or not the international community, through the United Nations, could play a larger role in this event, in this circumstance. But there is no question that there is a real, genuine concern, because there are several million people in Haiti, and the diaspora could cause some real—how can I say it?—confusion in the Western Hemisphere.\nAnd so—but I think that what the Prime Minister is suggesting, and we are as well going to be contributing, to see if we can both increase the efficiency and capacity of the training and the methods used by the police department, as well as seeing if we can engage other people in the hemisphere, which we've been talking to, and they're prepared to do some. So it's a work in progress.\n[Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nCan I follow up with one point on Haiti? And that is that any decision about military force, which—it's often raised, we think would have to be done in consultation with the United Nations and with the Haitian Government. And so that is not off the table, but that is not in play at the moment.\nI'm sorry.\nFirst of all, have you ever known Wall Street not in consternation? Number one.\nLook, I think we've done a pretty damn good job. People's savings are secure, and even those beyond the $250,000 the FDIC is guaranteeing them. And the American taxpayer is not going to have to pay a penny. The banks are in pretty good shape. What's going on in Europe isn't a direct consequence of what's happening in the United States.\nAnd I—what we would do is, if we find that there's more instability than appears, we'd be in a position to have the FDIC use the power it has to guarantee those loans above 250, like they did already.\nAnd so I think it's going to take a little while for things to just calm down. But I don't see anything that's on the horizon that's about to explode. But I do understand there's an unease about this. And these mid-sized banks have to be able to survive, and I think they'll be able to do that.\nCanada-U.S. Trade\nBingo.\nAnd by the way, we each have what the other needs. We each have what the other needs.\nThe idea that somehow Canada is somehow put at a disadvantage—because we're going to probably be investing billions of dollars in their ability to package what is coming out of the semiconductor area—I don't get it. How's that in any way do anything other than hire and bring billions of dollars into Canada?\nI also don't understand how, when we talk about it, we—we greatly need Canada, in terms of the minerals that are needed. Well, you guys—we don't have the minerals to mine. You can mine them. You don't want to produce—I mean, you know, turn them into product. We do.\nI mean, it's—I'm a little confused, at least thus far, on why this is a disadvantage for Canada and the United States. I think we each have what the other needs.\nAnd let me conclude by saying: You know, when I started talking about we're going to build our economies from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, I was being literal. Because what happened is, if you think about it—in Democrat and Republican administrations beginning over 30 years ago or more in the United States—corporate America decided that what they're going to do is they're going to export jobs and import product because it was cheaper labor.\nWell, guess what? Now we are making sure they import jobs here—jobs here—and we export product. Canada is doing the same thing.\nSo this is a real shift in the world economy, in terms of what we're prepared to do. And I'll be darned if I'm going to stick in a situation where, as long as I'm President, where we have to rely on a supply chain in the other end of the world that is affected by politics, pandemics, or anything else.\nWe're not hurting anyone in terms of having access to the start of the supply chain. It's available.\nBut again, I predict to you, you're going to see, after we're both out of office, both China—I mean, China out of the game, in terms of many of the—the product they're producing, and the United States and Canada pretty solid economically situated for the future in terms of also bringing back manufacturing jobs.\nSorry. And they're telling me I'm talking too long because we've got to go to dinner. [Laughter]\nI have nothing to add. [Laughter]\nFirst of all, I don't think it is, but I'll be very brief.\nThe difficult decision was on what we do with the Willow Project in Alaska, and my strong inclination was to disapprove of it across the board. But the advice I got from counsel was that if that were the case, we may very well lose in court—lose that case in court to the oil company—and then not be able to do what I really want to do beyond that, and that is, conserve significant amounts of Alaskan sea and land forever.\nI was able to see to it that we are literally able to conserve millions of acres—not a few—millions of acres of sea and land forever so it cannot be used in the future.\nI am banking on—we'll find out—that the oil company is going to say not—that's not going to be challenged, and they're going to go with three sites. And the energy that is going to be produced they're estimating would account to 1 percent—1 percent—of the total production of oil in the world.\nAnd so I thought it was a good—a—the better gamble and a hell of a tradeoff to have the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Sea and so many other places off limits forever now. I think we put more land in conservation than any administration since Teddy Roosevelt. I'm not positive of that, but I think that's true.\nThank you.\nWe are not going to stop.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada-ottawa-canada"}

{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea", "Date": "2023-04-26", "Text": "Please, be seated. Well, Mr. President, it's good to see you again, my friend.\nWe've met several times over the last year. And each time, we have deepened our nations' partnership and for the benefit, I think, of both our peoples. And today is no exception.\nOur nations' relationship is a—has a been a great success story. The alliance formed in war and has flourished in peace. Seemingly every day, we've launched new areas of cooperation on cyber, strategic technologies, in space, democracy, and all the areas that matter most to our future.\nBecause of its core, our alliance is about building a better future for all of our people. And there's no better example than our economic relationship and partnership, which has—is delivering incredible benefits to both our nations.\nThrough the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, we're advancing economic growth grounded in high standards for our workers, for the environment, and for communities throughout the region. We're standing together against economic influence being leveraged in coercive ways. And since I took office, Korean companies have invested more than $100 billion in the United States, driving innovation and spurring good new jobs for Americans and Korean workers.\nOur mutual defense treaty is ironclad, and that includes our commitment to extended deterrence, and that includes the nuclear threat and the nuclear deterrent. They are particularly important in the face of the D.P.R.K.'s increased threats and the blatant violation of U.S. [U.N.; White House correction] sanctions.\nAt the same time, we continue to seek serious and substantial diplomatic breakthroughs with the D.P.R.K. to bolster stability on the Peninsula, reduce the threat of proliferation, and address our humanitarian and human rights concerns for the people of the D.P.R.K.\nThe Republic of Korea and the United States are working together, including through our trilateral cooperation with Japan, to ensure the future of the Indo-Pacific is free, is open, prosperous, and secure. I want to thank you again, Mr. President, for your political courage and personal commitment to diplomacy with Japan. I've worked on these issues for a long time, and I can tell you it makes an enormous difference when we all pull together.\nI also welcome and support your administration's new Indo-Pacific strategy. It's a strategy that affirms how aligned our two nations are and our visions of the region, and how similar they are.\nToday we discussed our work together on promoting peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, ensuring freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and beyond.\n[At this point, President Biden cleared his throat.]\nExcuse me.\nI also affirmed our shared commitment—we, together, shared our affirmed shared commitment to stand with the people of Ukraine against Russia's brutal assault on their freedom, their territorial integrity, and democracy. And the Republic of Korea's strong support for Ukraine is important, because Russians' flagrant—Russia's flagrant violation of international law matters to nations everywhere in the world, not just in Europe.\nWhen I—when it comes right down to it, it's about what you believe, what you stand for, what kind of future you want for your children and grandchildren. And right now I believe the world is at an inflection point. The choices we make today, I believe, are going to determine the direction of our world and the future of our kids for decades to come.\nThat's why this partnership is so important, Mr. President, because we share the same values, the same vision. And I greatly appreciate, Mr. President, that the Republic of Korea cochaired the second Summit on Democracies last month and that you will host the third Summit on—for Democracies. We both understand that our democracies and our people are our greatest sources of strength. And working together, they make our nations stronger and more effective.\nFrom tracking the climate crisis and strengthening our effort to fight it, and strengthening global health, no two countries are better suited to meet the challenges ahead than the Republic of Korea and the United States.\nI want to thank you again, Mr. President, for your friendship, your partnership, and all you've done to help build a future of shared strength and success.\nThe floor is yours, Mr. President.\nThank you.\nNow we're going to take some questions. The first question is from Courtney [Courtney Subramanian] of the Los Angeles Times.\nSemiconductor Manufacturing/China/South Korea-U.S. Trade\nLet me respond to your question first.\nMy desire to increase U.S. manufacturing and jobs in America is not about China. I'm not concerned about China.\nRemember, America invented the semiconductor. We invented it. We used to have 40 percent of the market. And we decided that what we're going to do over the past—I don't know how many decades—we decided that it was going to be cheaper to export jobs and import product. And along came the pandemic. And the pandemic taught us that—we used to have, as I said, 40 percent of the market just some years ago. Now it's down to 10 percent. And again, we invented the super—we got—so I decided to go out and see what we could do to increase our hold on the market once again. And so what I did was I went around the country. As well as in addition to passing the CHIPS and Science Act, I, in fact, visited countries around the world. And two significant South Korean companies decided they were going to invest billions of dollars in chip manufacturing in the United States.\nIt wasn't designed to hurt China. It was designed to—so we didn't have to worry about whether or not we had access to semiconductors. For example, during the pandemic, what happened was all of a sudden everybody started to learn the phrase \"supply chain.\" A year ago, no one knew what the hell anybody was talking about when you said \"supply chain.\" But now they all know. And we lost access to these semiconductors of which new automobiles in the United States need 30,000 of them just to build a new automobile. And we didn't have them.\nSo we started to invest here. And what happened was, when we encouraged the investment through the CHIPS and Science Act—and now we have enormous investment in the United States—well over $200 billion in long-term investment in semiconductors. And we're rebuilding the economy of the United States with those semiconductors. It's not designed to hurt China.\nThe only thing I did say with regard to China: There are certain extremely sophisticated semiconductors that we have built that are useful for nuclear and/or other weapons systems. Those we are not selling. We're not exporting them to China or anyone else.\nAnd so that's the context in which this has all occurred. In the meantime, we're creating thousands of jobs and bringing back a sense of pride and dignity to so many towns in the country where, all of a sudden, over the last three decades, we found out that factory that hired—had 600 people shut down. The soul of that community was lost.\nAnd so I made sure, when the semiconductors were coming back, that they were not just going to go to the coast, they'd be all over the country. And so we have a significant \"field of dreams\" in—outside of—in Ohio, outside of Columbus. We're in Texas. We're in Arizona. Anyway—they're all over the country.\nSo it's not viewed to hurt anyone else. We are providing access to those semiconductors. We're not—we're a supply chain you can count on.\nBut we are not—we are not—going to sit back and be in a position where we don't have access to those semiconductors. We are not going to be a place where we're the end of that line. We're the beginning of it. And it's generating significant economic growth in America and not hurting anybody.\nAnd by the way, it's creating jobs in South Korea. It's creating jobs in South Korea, and not just with SK, but—anyway—with Samsung and other industries.\nSo I think it's a win-win.\nThe response that I would give you is that the extended deterrence means that we are having more consultation with whatever action is to be contemplated or taken. And we made it really very, very clear.\nAny—the R.O.K. has repeatedly formed its—confirmed its commitment to the nonproliferation treaty. And the Washington Declaration is a prudent step to reinforce extended deterrence and respond to advancing D.P.R.K. nuclear threat.\nLook, a nuclear attack by North Korea against the United States or its allies or partisans—partners—is unacceptable and will result in the end of whatever regime, were it to take such an action.\nAnd it's about strengthening deterrence in response to the D.P.R.K.'s escalatory behavior and to deal in complete consultation.\nAnd you know, the idea that I have absolute authority as Commander in Chief and the sole authority to use a nuclear weapon. But, you know, what the declaration means is that we're going make every effort to consult with our allies when it's appropriate if any actions are so called for.\nCertainly, we've talked about this and some other things today. But the bottom line here is: There's even closer cooperation, closer consultation. And we're not going to be stationing nuclear weapons on the Peninsula, but we will have visits to—port visits of nuclear submarines and things like that. We are not walking away from that.\nMy turn to ask a question? I think the next question is Mary Bruce, ABC.\n2024 U.S. Presidential Election/Former President Donald J. Trump/President Biden's Age/President Biden's Accomplishments\nI may not be the only one, but I know him well. And I know the danger he presents to our democracy. And we've been down this road before.\nAnd with regard to age, you know, and polling data, I noticed the polling data I keep hearing about is that I'm between 42 and 46 percent favorable rating, et cetera. And—but everybody running for reelection in this time has been in the same position. There's nothing new about that. You're making it sound like \"Biden is really underwater.\" And—number one.\nNumber two, when the same polling data asks whether they think—what kind of job I've done, it gets overwhelmingly positive results, from 58 percent thinking everything from the CHIPS Act and the—all the things we've done.\nYou know, we've created—like I said, we've created 12 million new jobs. We've created 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have economic growth moving. We're in a situation where the climate—we've invested more money and more help in dealing with the climate crisis than any nation in the world.\nAnd so, things are moving. And the reason I'm running again is there's a job to finish.\nThe other thing is that—look, you know, think about what I inherited when I got elected. I inherited a nation in overwhelming debt at the time, number one—in the hole for the 4 years that he was President.\nYou know, the first meeting I attended—the G-7—I said, \"American is back.\" And one of the world leaders looked and said: \"For how long? For how long?\" There was a great concern about the United States being able to lead the free world. And we're doing that again.\nAnd those same polls you look at—you take a look at the polls that are saying whether I pulled together NATO and the European Union, as well as the Asian partners. I think we have. But there's more to do.\nAnd with regard to age, I can't even say—if I guess how old I am, I can't even say the number. It doesn't—it doesn't register with me.\nAnd—but the only thing I can say is that one of the things that people are going to find out—they're going to see a race, and they're going to judge whether or not I have it or don't have it. I respect them taking a hard look at it. I'd take a hard look at it as well. I took a hard look at it before I decided to run.\nAnd I feel good. I feel excited about the prospects. And I think we're on the verge of really turning the corner in a way we haven't in a long time.\nI know you're tired of hearing me say we're at an inflection point, but we really are. What happens in the next 2, 3, 4 years is going to determine what the next three or four decades look like. And I have never been more optimistic in my life about the possibilities of the United States.\nYes, I think I still would be running if he wasn't. I do know him well. He's not hard to know, as you know. You know him well, too.\nAnd the question is whether or not—look, there's just—there's more to finish the job. We have an opportunity to put ourselves in a position where we are economically and politically secure for a long time.\nLook, there—we continue to have—and I know you don't like me—hearing me saying it. There's still a contest between autocracies and democracies, and we're the leading democracy in the world. And it's something I know a fair amount about. It's something I care about and something that I have found a willingness of an awful lot of our allies and friends to follow.\nSo I think that, you know, we have to finish the job and nail it down.\nThey need to repeat the question.\nYou need the microphone.\n[A White House aide provided a microphone to the reporter.]\nThat guy on the right's stealing the microphone.\nThe reassurance is that it's overwhelmingly in our interests for Korea to do well. No, it is. It's very much in America's interest that Korea do well in the Pacific—very well—because they are one of our most valued partners.\nAnd so I think the combination of growing democracies and the democratic institutions, as well as their economies, is overwhelmingly in the benefit of the United States, whether it is in South Korea or it's in Australia, in the deep South Pacific.\nAnd so I think that there's a reason—overwhelming reason.\nPlus, in addition to that, we're increasing the number of student exchanges, access to more information between our folks, educating our people, as well as we're going to be cooperating on everything from space to technology to medicine. And so there's so many opportunities we have.\nAnd I don't think we—at least we don't—and I don't think, so far, most of the South Korean companies believe that there's somehow a U.S. effort to slow them down, prevent their growth, or anything like that. We'd like to see them grow. And I mean that sincerely.\nIt's overwhelmingly in the U.S. interest for South Korea to do very well economically. It's overwhelmingly in our interest because it has——\nAnd lastly, you know, I think we underestimate the example that South Korea sets. Here you have a nation that is significant, but is not a nation of 2-, 3-, 400,000 people, making the kind of changes it's making.\nIt gives other smaller nations hope to believe that if they have democratic institutions and commitment and impact on industries that in fact are the cutting-edge industries—new sciences and technology, including AI and other things—that there's a future for them. And I think that's what this is about.\nAnd so we view South Korea's economic growth as a benefit to the United States, as well as freedom around the world.\nThank you all so very much. Appreciate it.\nPublic Debt Limit/Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin O. McCarthy\nThey haven't figured out the debt limit yet.\nI'm happy to meet with McCarthy, but not on whether or not the debt limit gets extended. That's not negotiable.\nI notice they quote Reagan and they quote—they quote Reagan all the time and they quote Trump, both of which said—it says—I'm paraphrasing—it would be an absolute crime to not extend the debt limit.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Hiroshima, Japan", "Date": "2023-05-21", "Text": "Please have a seat. I don't think there's enough press here. [Laughter]\nWell, good evening, everyone. Before turning to the important work we accomplished here at the G-7, I want to take a few minutes addressing the budget negotiations that I'm heading back home to deal with.\nBefore I left for this trip, I met with all four congressional leaders, and we agreed the only way to move forward was on a bipartisan agreement.\nAnd we've—I've done my part. We put forward a proposal that cuts spending by more than a trillion dollars and on top of the nearly $3 trillion in deficit reduction that I previously proposed through the combination of spending cuts and new revenues. Now it's time for the other side to move their—from their extreme positions, because much of what they've already proposed is simply, quite frankly, unacceptable.\nAnd so let me be clear: I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects, for example, a $30 billion tax break for the oil industry, which made $200 billion last year—they don't need an incentive of another $30 billion—while putting health care of 21 million Americans at risk by going after Medicaid.\nI'm not going to agree to a deal that protects $200 billion in excess payments for pharmaceutical industries and refusing to count that while cutting over 100,000 schoolteachers and assistants' jobs, 30,000 law enforcement officers' jobs cut across the entire United States of America.\nAnd I'm not going to agree to a deal that protects wealthy tax cheats and crypto traders while putting food assistance at risk for nearly a hundred—why, excuse me—nearly 1 million Americans.\nAnd it's time for Republicans to accept that there is no bipartisan deal to be made solely—solely—on their partisan terms. They have to move as well.\nAll four congressional leaders agree with me that default is not—let me say it again—default is not an option. And I expect each of the—I expect each of these leaders—excuse me——\n[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]\n——to live up to that commitment. America has never defaulted—never defaulted—on our debt, and it never will.\nThe Speaker and I will be talking later on the plane as we head back, because it's, what, 5 or 6, 7 o'clock in the morning there. And our teams are going to continue working.\nNow, we've had a—we've had a packed few days here at Hiroshima and, I think, with very productive and important meetings at the G-7 summit.\nWe also held the Quad meeting here in Hiroshima, rather than Australia, and important bilateral discussions with Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine, as well as the Prime Minister of India.\nThis is my third trip to the Indo-Pacific as President, and I look forward to rescheduling my stops in Papua New Guinea and Australia later. I've spoken with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, and Secretary Blinken is traveling there to meet with the Pacific Island partners at that moment.\nAnd I've also—going to be hosting—and I've spoken with the Prime Minister—hosting the leaders of the Pacific Island Forum in Washington this fall, because I was unable to make it to Papua New Guinea. And Prime Minister Albanese, we're going to have a state visit later this year.\nAnd I also want to thank President [Prime Minister; White House correction] Kishida for his outstanding—and I'm not—it's not hyperbole—his outstanding leadership of the G-7 this year, as well as Mrs. Kishida and the entire Japanese Government for the hospitality they've shown to Jill and myself and our whole team.\nBeing in this city and visiting the memorial on Friday was a powerful reminder of the devastating reality of nuclear war and our shared responsibility to never cease our efforts to build for peace. And together, with the leaders of the G-7, we have reiterated our commitment to continuing to work toward a world free from the threat of nuclear weapons.\nOver—the past few days have showcased the unity—the unity of purpose—among the G-7. It's a very different organization than it was 5, 7, 10 years ago, because we're addressing the challenges that matter most to the world.\nWe're united in our efforts to strengthen global health security, and yesterday I announced that the United States plans to contribute another $250 million to the Pandemic Fund at the World Bank to make sure the world is better prepared to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemics.\nWe're united in our commitment to climate action and accelerating the transition to a global clean energy economy by investing in the industries of the future.\nWe're united in our push to build a more resilient and inclusive global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we've experienced over the last few years, including by building a more secure and more diversified supply chain.\nThrough the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which we launched last year at the G-7 summit in Germany, we've addressed the infrastructure needs that are holding back too many low- and moderate-income countries, particularly in the Global South.\nThe United States has already mobilized more than $30 billion in PGII projects around the globe, a significant step toward our collective pledge of the G-7 to mobilize $600 billion in investment by 2027. And we resolved to reform the multilateral development banks to give them more flexibility and better able fight poverty by helping respond to global challenges.\nNow, we're also united in our approach to the People's Republic of China, and the joint statement released yesterday outlines the shared principles we've all agreed at the G-7 and beyond in dealing with China. We're not looking to decouple from China, we're looking to de-risk and diversify our relationship with China.\nThat means taking steps to diversify our supply chains, and we're not—so we're not dependent on any one country for necessary product. It means resisting economic coercion together and countering harmful practices that hurt our workers. It means protecting a narrow set of advanced technologies critical for our national security. And those elements are all agreed on by the G-7.\nFinally, joined here in Hiroshima by President Zelenskyy, and the G-7 reaffirmed our shared and unwavering—let me say it again—our shared and unwavering commitment to stand with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend themselves against Russia's brutal war of aggression and the war crimes being committed. Together with our partner countries, we reiterated a need for a just peace that respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, both core principles of the U.N. Charter. Russia started this war, and Russia could end it today by withdrawing its troops from Ukraine internationally recognized borders and ceasing its assault.\nUntil then—excuse me—the ability—Ukraine's ability to defend itself is essential to being able to end this war permanently and through diplomacy. You know, and this morning I once more shared and assured President Zelenskyy, together with all G-7 members and our allies and partners around the world, that we will not waver. Putin will not break our resolve, as he thought he could 2 years ago—almost 3 years ago.\nWe're going to continue to provide economic, humanitarian, and security assistance to Ukraine so it can stand strong as long as it needs it. And today the United States announced our latest tranche of artillery, ammunition, antitank weapons, and bridging equipment to help Ukraine succeed in the battlefield.\nYou know, in my private meeting with President Zelenskyy after the G-7 meeting and with his staff, I told him the United States, together with our allies and partners, is going to begin training Ukrainian pilots in fourth-generation fighter aircraft, including F-16s, to strengthen Ukraine's Air Force as part of a long-term commitment to Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\nWe provided, the last year, all that they needed to deal with what they were dealing with at the moment, and that's what—and now we're moving in the direction of putting them in a position to be able to be—defend themselves in ways beyond what they've had to deal with so far.\nThe past few days have once more underscored how important America's global leadership is. A presumptuous thing for an American President to say, but I think you'll find, if you ask if any of our colleagues, it's true.\nThe security and prosperity of the American people are substantially increased by working in concert with our closest allies and partners to build a future of greater economic strength and resilience and a world that is more peaceful and stable.\nAnd on many of the issues that matter to the American people—accelerating our clean energy transition, preventing another pandemic, dealing with China, standing up for Ukraine—the meetings I've had with my fellow G-7 leaders have left us more united, more resolved, and more determined to set up for the greater progress in the months ahead. And this has been an extremely significant and important summit.\nWith that, I'm going to take some questions. And Trevor [Trevor Hunnicutt], of Reuters.\nNo, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement. As I've told you—and you may be aware or you've seen it—we have provided for a proposal that would cut a trillion dollars off the baseline spent from the year before by just agreeing to deal with what was initially offered.\nAnd secondly, we're in a situation where the—let me put it this way: If you all were doing your budget at home, and you said, \"Okay, we have to make some cuts,\" would you only look at the spending or would you also look at your income—what was coming in the door—to determine what you could afford?\nAnd so part of what I've been arguing from the beginning is a need to consider the tax structure as well as—as well as—cutting spending. I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.\nBut I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the—my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration. The fact that they are—we've provided for the number of—we got a lot of input from serious economists and former administration officials in both parties that we need more people who are qualified to be able to look at the tax returns of the thousand billionaires in America—very complicated stuff.\nIt's estimated that if we had the appropriate number of tax personnel, that we would save somewhere between—we would generate somewhere between $200 billion and $400 billion in tax revenue.\nAnd there's a lot of other—for example, the idea that we're—in terms of taxes—that they refuse to—for example, we—I was able to balance the budget and pass everything from the global warming bill—anyway, I was able to cut, by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction] in the first 2 years, the deficit that we were accumulating.\nAnd—because I was able to say, too, that the 55 corporations in America that made forty—$400 billion—or $40 billion—$400 billion—that they—they pay zero in tax. Zero. And so we said, \"You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes.\" What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.\nAnd so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.\nAnd like I said, we're now down to—we went from somewhere—roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.\nSo my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table. And so that's what I continue—we continue to have a significant disagreement on, on the revenue side.\nI know they won't. I know they won't.\nMatter of fact, the fact that we were able to cut Government spending by $1.7 trillion, that didn't cause a recession; that caused growth. Look, we have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We've created 12-point—I think it's—7 million new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have moved in a direction where we're rebuilding and reconstructing America through the infrastructure act.\nLook, here's the other thing. I'm sure—I'm not sure; my guess is, I'll get a question about, you know, \"Well, wait a minute, you know, the American people aren't satisfied.\" Well, guess what? As I've told you all before, most of this—what we've passed—doesn't kick in—it only kicks in over time. And so the fact is, for example, that if you're in a situation where you were—I'll give you the one example that I've used—everybody understands the easiest—is insulin.\nWell, I decided that we were going to be in a position where we were not going to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. And that's what we do, by the way. Same manufacturer of a drug in the United States, selling it here in Japan, selling it in Tokyo, or selling it in Berlin, or selling it around the world, they pay a lot less than we pay at home.\nSo we said a simple proposition: Let's take a look at how much it costs to make the product. And I'm not going to ask you to—a show of hands like I do in a town meeting, but if—I usually ask, \"How many people know somebody who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes?\" And I'm almost—at least half the audience raises their hand.\nWell, they were paying somewhere between $4- and $700 a month for their insulin that they badly need to stay healthy and alive. Well, guess what? It costs $10—t-e-n—$10 to make. To package, total amount, you could argue maybe as much as $13.\nWell, guess what? Now they can't charge more for—Medicare can't, because Medicare is paying—taking American tax dollars and paying for the elderly's health care needs. You can't charge more than $35 for that drug. That saves $160 billion. Hear it? A hundred and sixty billion dollars less will be paid out by the Federal—by the American taxpayer to help the elderly people on Medicare with a problem.\nWell, a lot of this is just kicking in. We're in a situation where next year, for the drug costs, no senior will have to pay—total cost—total cost of all the drugs, from expensive cancer drugs to whatever drugs they're taking, will not have to pay more than $3,500 a year. The following year—we've already passed this. This is the law now. The following year, they won't have to pay more than $2,000. That saves another $200 billion that we're paying out.\nBut the other team won't count this. Even though it's the law—we passed it—they won't count that as reducing the debt.\nSo there's a lot of those kinds of disagreements we have. And my guess is that I'm going to be talking to the Speaker of the House on the way back on the plane, because it will be morning time over—at home. And I'm going to be in that plane in about an hour or so. And my guess is, he's going to want to deal directly with me in making sure we're all on the same page.\nBut it's probably more than you wanted to know.\nHow about Masaru, NHK [Masaru Takagi; NHK World].\nWell, number one, you're right, we should have an open hotline. At the Bali conference, that's what President Xi and I agreed we were going to do and meet on. And then this silly balloon that was carrying two freight cars' worth of spying equipment was flying over the United States, and it got shot down, and everything changed in terms of talking to one another. I think you're going to see that begin to thaw very shortly. But in the meantime, what's happened is: I think it's fair to say, for those of you who have dealt with the Japanese Government and reported from here for a long time, the situation in terms of our relations with Japan have never, ever, ever in American history been stronger. Never. Never.\nAnd we started this relationship when I came to see—some of you were with me on my first trip here—when I came to see President [Prime Minister; White House correction] Kishida's predecessor and made the case that what was happening in Europe was the small—the world is getting smaller.\nWhat's happening in Europe and the invasion of Ukraine is, it affects everyone, including people here in the Pacific basin. And so we've ended up where you have Japan stepping up in a way that's of real consequence, in terms of your defense budget, number one, and a beginning of a rapprochement with South Korea.\nI've spoken at length with President Loon [Yoon; White House correction] of South Korea. He came to Washington of late. He's agreed—we're all of the same agreement—that, in fact, we are not going to—we're maintaining—we all agree we're going to maintain the \"one China\" policy, which says—everybody kind of forgets—I mean, you all know it, but the public kind of forgets that it says that neither country, Japan—I mean, China or Taiwan—neither territory can independently declare what they're going to do. Period. There has to be a mutually agreed-to outcome.\nAnd so we're sticking by that. We're not going to tell China what they can do. We made it clear that we don't expect—we don't expect Taiwan to independently declare independence either.\nBut in the meantime, we're going to continue to put Taiwan in a position that they can defend themselves. And there is clear understanding among most of our allies that, in fact, if China were to act unilaterally, there would be a response. There would be a response.\nBut I—so I don't think there's anything inevitable about the notion that there's going to be this conflict between the United States and the West and/or Japan and Korea and the Quad.\nAnd if you take a look at what's happened, we are more secure, with all the talk about China's building its military—it is building its military, and that's why I've made it clear that I am not going to prepare—I'm not prepared to trade certain items with China.\nAnd when I was asked by President Xi why, I said, \"Because you're using them to build nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and I'm not going to do it.\" And we've now got commitment from all of our allies, they're not going to either provide that kind of material that allows them to do that.\nBut that's not a hostile act. That's an act that says we're going to make sure that we do everything we can to maintain the status quo ante.\nAnd what's going on now is the—look at the meeting we had here today and yesterday of the Quad. I'll bet you—I would—maybe some of you thought it, but I doubt many people in this audience or any other audience would have said that 2 years after being elected, I'd be able to convince India, Australia, Japan, and the United States to form an organization called the Quad to maintain stability in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.\nWell, when asked by the Prime Minister—by President Xi why we're doing that, I said: \"Simple: We have—international organizations have agreed upon what constitutes open airspace and sea space. And we're not going to allow that to be unilaterally altered. Period.\" We're not changing any rules, we're just making sure that we unite democracies in the conviction that the Pacific basin remains what it was before: open and clear. So I guess what I'm saying is—I don't \"guess\" what I'm saying—what I'm trying to say is, I think we're more united than we've ever been—ever been—in the Pacific, in terms of maintaining stability and maintaining a sense of security.\nSo I'm not sure that answers your question, but I hope it does. If it doesn't, you want to follow up with any portion of that question?\nWell, how about—if you don't want to follow up, how about Annmarie [Annmarie Hordern] of Bloomberg TV and Radio?\nYes and no. No, I'm not going to ease the sanctions. But yes, I think we should—on the front end of your question is that we—there's a lot that is going on relative to spending. And we have agreed to cut spending. We've cut spending, and we're going to continue to cut spending.\nBut the question is: What base do you start from? Initially, if you remember, when the Republicans introduced their—when the Speaker, by, I guess, a four- or five-vote majority, was able to pass his—what he calls—extending the debt with a limitation on how—what you had to do to extend it, in terms of the budget side. I said, I'm not going to negotiate on whether to extend the debt. I will negotiate on a budget.\nOn the budget side of the equation, they came along and said, initially—it was hard to determine where they are, quite frankly; and, I don't know, you all may know more from questioning them than I do. But they just came along and said, \"We're going to move off of the 2023 budget, and that's the baseline we're going to use for the next 2 years—that budget.\" And I said, \"Well, what about what you all just voted on after the budget, which was the add-on money that you all agreed to and the House and Senate voted for?\" And they said, \"Well, that includes that as well.\"\nI said, \"Okay, well, then we may be able to work on something.\" So we started calculating what that would mean, in terms of—it came to a 22-percent cut for everything in the budget but the things that have already been passed—the five big initiatives that I've already passed, in terms of infrastructure, the Affordable Care Act, et cetera.\nBut, in the meantime, what happened is that—that seems to be changing. They said, \"Well, we're going to exempt\"—remember we said that, well, you're going to cut veterans because 20—[inaudible]—said everything—that's discretionary budget. They said, \"No, we're not going to cut veterans.\" Okay, that's good.\nAnd we—initially, when they started off, they were going to cut Medicare and Medicaid. They said, \"Whoa, whoa, no.\" I mean, not Medicaid; Social Security and Medicare. They said, \"No, no, no, no.\" The first time I ever had a negotiation in the State of the Union message.\nBut they said, \"No, we're not going to cut that.\" Okay, well, that's off—off the radar. \"What else is off the radar?\" And they named some other things. And I said, \"Well, that means if you want to get the number you wanted from freezing the budget at 2023, plus the additions you added, then it means you're going to go from 22 percent—you're going to end up cutting 30 percent or 35 percent discretionary budget.\"\nFor example, if you calculate what they're talking about, you're going to lose—they're going to lose 100,000 teachers and assistants. They're going to lose thousands of police officers across the board. I mean, just calculate what it means if you take all discretionary spending and you make no distinctions other than what the percentage number of the cut is. And some of it makes absolutely no sense at all.\nAnd so what we've done is: We're going to have to sit down—and I'm hoping that—that Speaker McCarthy is just waiting to negotiate with me when I get home, which has been—I don't know whether that's true or not; we'll find out.\nBut at first, we weren't making progress. Then we made a lot of progress. And then, all of a sudden, they came back with a proposal that was very cut back from where they had agreed or discussed. And now I don't know where we—we gave a counterproposal to the counter again—and I know this sounds ridiculous, but that's what we did—and I'm waiting to hear their response to what we have offered.\nWe are willing to cut spending, as well as raise revenue so people start paying their fair share. Again, if this were a town meeting, I'd ask, \"Raise your hand if you think the tax structure is fair—remotely fair. What do you think?\"\nNo, I know that. That's under negotiation right now. I thought you said would I lift sanctions on material I was going to send—sell their defense department, meaning would I sell some—the answer to that's under discussion.\nJim Tankersley, New York Times.\nOh.\nFirst of all, it would be a very serious circumstance if we didn't pay our debt for the first time in 230 years. That would be a serious problem.\nSo far, there's been very little discussion—and they all know what's going on—about whether or not we're going to default on our debt. Number—no, number two.\nNumber three, I can't guarantee that they wouldn't force a default by doing something outrageous. I can't guarantee that. Number four, I'm looking at the 14th Amendment, as to whether or not we have the authority. I think we have the authority. The question is: Could it be done and invoked in time that it could not—would not be appealed and, as a consequence, pass the date in question and still default on the debt. That's a question that I think is unresolved.\nAnd so the point is, I think—I'm hoping and I believe that when we stood in that—when we sat in the room with all the leaders, from Mitch McConnell on, and they said: \"We will not default. Period. We will not default.\" That's what all, including Kevin McCarthy, said. \"We will not default.\"\nAnd so I'm assuming that we mean what we say, and we'll figure out a way to not have to default.\nElizabeth Palmer, CBS News.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.This is the last question, sir.\nHey.\nUkraine/U.S. Security Assistance\nWell, I'll tell you exactly when they're going to move, exactly where they're going to go. He told me—[laughter]—come on. God love you. I'm going to—even if I knew precisely, you think I'm going to tell you what they're going to do in terms of their offensive?\nWell, I hope you hope I wouldn't do that, because that would mean it wouldn't succeed.\nBut the fact is that we did discuss privately with Zelenskyy—I did discuss with Zelenskyy how—let me put it this way: We and our NATO allies know how many brigades they have trained, know what the status of those brigades are, and have an expectation as to what their likelihood of succeeding are.\nWe don't know that for certain. War is uncertain. War is uncertain, to state the obvious. So, and my—it will proceed. I can't—if—even if I—I think I do know, but I'm not going to tell you because that would not be a smart thing to do either.\nSo, having said that, the expectation and hope is that they will be successful in that it will make it clear to Russia that the cost—for example, Bakhmut: Bakhmut is a discussion about whether or not it's been lost or whatever. And well, the truth of the matter is, the Russians have suffered over 100,000 casualties in Bakhmut. That's hard to make up. That's hard to make up.\nSo, whether or not there is—there are troops in Bakhmut occupying—there's not many buildings left standing in Bakhmut. It's a pretty devastated city. But they have been able to move in a direction that they've been able to lock down an awful lot of the Russian forces, including the Wagner Group. So, with regard to the F-16s, F-16s would not have helped in that regard at all. It was unnecessary. For example—let's take just Bakhmut, for example—would not have any—any additional added consequence.\nBut what's happened is: Since the provision of everything from the significant missile defense systems, tanks, sophisticated tanks and the like—all the things that were of consequence in the near term in the Donbas area and where the fighting was taking place—they now have all that equipment. There's a little bit still coming, but they have all that equipment.\nWhat's going to happen, though, is if they continue to do well, they're going to be in a situation where you're going to have the Russians being able to stand off at a greater distance for maintaining their headquarters and other things, which are out of range of certain—of the existing capacity they have. And they have to be able to be in a position where now those fighter jets, those F-16s, make a big difference in terms of being able to deal with what is coming down the road.\nAnd, God willing—and we don't know this—if they're successful and there ends up being an accommodation where there is not a cease-fire, but there is a peace agreement that gets worked out, that they'll have the capacity to have confidence in their ability to resist response by the Russians if they were to change their position.\nSo that's the essence of the difference. Did you—was there another part of the question?\nNo. Not the perception—I don't expect the F-16s to take part in the existing—let's assume that it's not, but let's assume tomorrow the offensive was starting—or in a week, or 2 or 5 or 7 or 10. It's not—highly unlikely they would take place in that context.\nBut it will take place in the context—if they're successful in the near term, they're going to then continue to have to fight with the Russians, who have headquarters beyond where they are now not able to be reached by the existing capacity that exists in their arsenal. So it's a different need, just like the tanks weren't needed in the beginning, but they're needed now. And so that's the nature of the change.\nI have a flat assurance from the—from Zelenskyy that they will not—they will not use it to go on and move into Russian geographic territory. But wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine in the area, they would be able to do that.\nThank you all very, very much. Appreciate it.\nIt is for them.\nOf course, no one would blame me. I know you won't. You'll be saying, \"Biden did a wonderful job.\" [Laughter] I know you.\nOn the merits based on what I've offered, I would be blameless. On the politics of it, no one would be blameless. And by the way, that's one of the—that's one of the things that some are contemplating.\nI actually had—well, I've got to be careful here. I think there are some MAGA Republicans in the House who know the damage that it would do to the economy. And because I am President, and Presidents are responsible for everything, Biden would take the blame. And that's the one way to make sure Biden is not reelected.\nThank you.\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre.Thank you, everybody.\nWe have not come up with a unilateral action that could succeed in a matter of 2 weeks or 3 weeks. That's the issue.\nSo it's up to lawmakers. But my hope and intention is, when we resolve this problem, I'd find a rationale to take it to the courts to see whether or not the 14th Amendment is, in fact, something that would be able to stop it.\nThank you.\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre.Okay, the press conference has concluded. Thanks, everybody. Thank you, everyone.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-hiroshima-japan"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom", "Date": "2023-06-08", "Text": "Well, good afternoon. Please have a—please be seated.\nI'd like to start, with the permission of my British friends, to just say a few words about the wildfires in Canada and the quality of the air here in the East Coast that's blanketed the communities in the East Coast and the smoke this past few days.\nI just put out a more detailed statement, so—for the press and for the people to see. But I spoke yesterday with Prime Minister Trudeau, and I've decided—I dictated a National Interagency Fire Center response to Canada's request for additional firefighters and the fire suppression assets, such as airtankers.\nWe already have 600 American firefighters on the ground that have been there for a while in Canada, including Hotshots and the Smokejumper crews.\nAnd it's very important that affected communities listen to the guidance of their State and local officials from this point forward. To keep up to date on the air quality in real time, go to the app that we provided. It's called airnow.gov. And check on one another.\n[At this point, the President held up a graphic.]\n——with a calibrated piece that says when the air is clean and when the air is dangerous and hazardous. And it dictates what—will tell you the air quality in your—in the neighborhood.\nNow, it's my honor—my honor to welcome Prime Minister Sunak to the White House.\nRishi, we've—you're probably tired of meeting. We met in March in—[laughter]—in San Diego to discuss AUKUS and—with the Prime Minister of Australia. In April, we were there for the 25th Anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement in Belfast. We met and discussed again today the need to get the Stormont institution in Northern Ireland up and running.\nLast month, together with our G-7 partners in Hiroshima, we drove progress on everything from our shared support for the brave people of Ukraine to the common principles of engaging with China.\nToday, in Washington, we have had important and positive discussions to deepen our bilateral economic relationship and expand our cooperation to shape the challenges and future for this—remainder of this century.\nIt's a testament to the depth, breadth, and, I would argue, the intensity of our cooperation and coordination, which has existed—continues to exist between the United Kingdom and the United States. There's no issue of global—of importance, none, that—where our nations are not leading together and where we're not sharing our common values to make things better.\nIn our conversations today, we continued to build on all that we've achieved over these past months. We discussed how we can continue to adapt and upgrade our partnership to ensure our countries remain at the cutting edge of a rapidly changing world.\nOur economic partnership is an enormous strength and source of strength that anchors everything that we do together. And we want to harness that power to make sure we're creating good jobs and supporting working class families in both our countries and that growth is shared broadly and no one gets left behind.\nSo today we're releasing a new plan to equip our economic partnership for the 21st century. It outlines how we can enhance our cooperation to accelerate the clean energy transition that must take place and is taking place, lead the development of—on—of emerging technologies that are going to shape so much of our future, and protect technologies critical to our national security.\nAnd a key piece of that is working together to strengthen our critical mineral supply chains and to make them more resilient so we're not dependent on any one country to meet our goals.\nWhen it came—when it comes to technology that will shape the future—like semiconductors, quantum computing, artificial intelligence—the U.K. and the U.S. are working together to make sure they are developed safely and responsibly and jointly.\nWe're going to do more on joint research and development to ensure the future we're building remains fundamentally aligned with our value set in both our countries.\nAnd we're doing more to prevent technologies that are invented and developed in our countries from being used for military or intelligence purposes by countries that do not share our values.\nToday we're—also discussed our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine and defend—who are defending themselves against the most brutal aggression we've seen in a long time, at the hands of Russia and Putin.\nThank you, Mr. Prime Minister.\nAll right. First question goes to James [James Politi] of the Financial Times. Unless he left.\nNo, not sure, and yes. [Laughter]\nLet me begin by answering your question. First of all, the Ukrainians should speak to the military operations; I won't do that from here. We've done everything we could collectively, but individually in the United States, to make them ready, to support that it will—that it's going to continue, and an evolving situation that we're—where we're very optimistic.\nIn talks with the Ukraine—and Ukrainians and particularly with Zelenskyy and our allies and partners, on commitments to Ukraine, long-term security—long-term security to deter future aggression after this war ends is the goal. And we're advancing this goal by providing them the support Ukraine needs now on the battlefield and helping them strengthen their military over the long term.\nThe fact of the matter is that I believe we'll have the funding necessary to support Ukraine as long as it takes. And I believe that we're going to—that that support will be real, even though there are—you hear some voices today on Capitol Hill about whether or not we should continue to support Ukraine and for how long we should support them.\nThe fact of the matter is, I ask people to picture what would happen if we were not supporting Ukraine. Do we think Russia would stop in Kyiv? Do you think that's all there would be happening? I think not, and I think the vast majority of my colleagues, even the critics, think that would not be the case as well.\nThere's much more to say about Ukraine, but I hope that answers your direct question.\nAlso, if you don't mind my making an addendum, I'd point out that not only do we have Europe responding—I spent a lot of time in Japan—the Japanese have stepped up. They've stepped up in terms of their budget. They've stepped up in terms of their involvement. They've stepped in—stepped up in terms of their support for Ukraine, realizing that an advance—a glaring invasion, with no pretext by anything other than conquering land, occurring in the 21st century is a danger not only in Europe but everywhere in the world.\nThe next question from the PBS NewsHour. Laura.\nI think you're going to steal the mike. That's why they're——\nLet me answer your first question. First of all, maybe quietly, when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them and let them know that the President and this administration has their back. And I mean that.\nLook, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.\nBut our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.\nIt's wrong for—that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are—they're gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors.\nThese are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel and it's callous. Not somebody else's kids; they're all our kids. They're the kids—and our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.\nAnd the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.\nBut number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.\nSecondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.\nWe're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end—the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.\nCongress has to pass—and I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass—must pass—the Equality Act and send it to my desk.\nLGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected.\nI think we had a really good discussion today about our economic relationship. And we've launched negotiations on critical materials and an agreement to deal with climate crisis.\nFor example, there is no reason why Great Britain will not play a major role in not only critical materials, but in investing in the United States of America and all of our initiatives relating to the need for critical materials, including battery technology and a whole range of things. Number one.\nNumber two, cooperating on data and AI. It is in a limitless capacity and possibility. We—but we have to do it with great care, not relative to one another but relative to the issue. Because when I convened the leaders in AI about—I think there were 13—here in the United States, the very architects of this—AI—they're also very concerned about it getting out of hand, and we've got to make sure we're all on the same page.\nAnd we're looking to Great Britain to lead that effort this fall in putting together a proposal—a group of nations to deal with how do we deal with this. It not only has the potential to cure cancer and many other things that are just beyond our comprehension, but it has the potential to do great damage if it's not controlled.\nAnd so we—we're looking for—I'll overstate it: We're looking for watermarks on everything that has to do with—\"produced by AI\" so we know from whence it comes. But there's a lot we have to do.\nAnd we're also addressing the national security risk posed by certain types of outbound investments. I had a discussion with Xi Jinping in China: Why was I not transferring certain technological capabilities? And I said, very simply, \"Because you're using them for weapons of mass destruction and intelligence intervention.\" And I said, \"If we can work out something on that, we'd have a very different relationship.\"\nSo what we're trying to do is figure out how together we can make sure that we have the—let me back up and say it this way: I don't think ever in the history of human endeavor has there been as fundamental potential technological change as is presented by artificial intelligence. It is staggering. It is staggering.\nYou have some of these leaders in the industry talking about how they're concerned whether a machine will be able to begin to think for itself, not need to be programmed. I mean, it's just—I know it sounds like science fiction, but it is close to science fiction, some of the things. It has enormous potential.\nAnd we're looking to Great Britain to help lead that effort, to figure out a way through this. So we're in full—total cooperation, because there's no one, no country we have greater faith in being able to negotiate this—no—not negotiate with individuals, negotiate our way through this—than the Prime Minister. And so we are in lockstep.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.Last question.\nWhat's the last part of your question? I'm sorry.\nMaybe. That remains to be seen. We're going to have to get a consensus within NATO to see that happen. They have a candidate who's a very qualified individual. But we're going to have—we have a lot of discussion, not between us, but in NATO, to determine what the outcome of that will be.\nAnd with regard to the first part of your question you wanted me to respond to?\nWell, look, my economic policy is totally consistent with what I think is in the interest of our NATO allies and our allies around the world.\nOne of the things that I decided to do—and I find that the Wall Street Journal—and I'm sure there is someone here from the Wall Street Journal and other publications that are talking about Bidenomics. I didn't realize it was—I had Bidenomics going.\nBut the bottom line was this: that the fundamental changes taking place in terms of international trade, nobody in—at least very few people in United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what a supply chain meant, what they're talking about, the supply chain.\nWhen we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles was because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic, we realized that—I decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth.\nAnd I made it clear to all our NATO allies and our partners as well that although we were going to generate a—for example, an AI capacity here—I mean, excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States, attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment, that that was available to all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as they—as we are and benefiting in a similar way.\nThe bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle-down economics, where if the—if the trickle-down economics resulted in both—in Democratic and Republican administrations for generations—in making sure we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product to—sent the work to those—to that neighbor or those neighbors who have the cheapest labor, and they send back their products.\nWell, I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacity—here in the United States, we're attracting capacity to build here in the United States to send product overseas, not the reverse.\nAnd I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. Matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home, they're doing similar things.\nSo that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materials—the battery technologies—to share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us.\nSo it is increasing trade. But right now it looks like it is—because the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it looks like it's only the United States. It's not. It's just a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth.\nAnd it's not just our citizens. Look, the Global South—there are going to be a billion people in Africa very shortly. One billion.\nAt the G-7, it was originally called Build Back Better World, but we were talking about—there's a new PPI [PGII; White House correction]—anyway—an industrial policy that we're all signed on to, to provide the countries in Africa and in the Global South an opportunity to grow, significantly grow, which benefits the United States, benefits Europe, benefits every country.\nBecause the reverse is true: If we don't figure a way in which these countries can grow and participate and have to—and be able to build infrastructure—you know, the Canadians—the—excuse me, the Chinese have a Belt and Road Initiative. Well, the Belt and Road Initiative turns out to be a debt and confiscation program. Not going very far.\nBut what we're doing—and we're going to be doing with our NATO allies, with the G-7—is providing opportunities. For example, Angola—I—should be in a position very soon to have the largest solar facility in the world, generating significant amounts of energy. It benefits us, benefits them, brings them into the 21st century in a way that they'd never been before.\nWe're talking about building—and I had my team putting together with other countries as well—to build a railroad from the Pacific Ocean—from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Indian Ocean. Never occurred before. How—we're—our Departments of Agriculture are working with these countries.\nSo there's a significant amount of cooperation, not to hoard capacity, but to expand capacity to further expand opportunity, because we all benefit from it.\nAnd one thing I've learned is that we are not going to be able to deal with the global warming, which is a consequential—single most consequential threat to humanity if we don't do it, unless we engage more together, not fewer—not less together.\nAnd so the United States will do what it can do well and invite all of our partners to be part of it if we can.\nThank you.\nI'm supposed to walk off the stage now. [Laughter]\nBut wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\nWhere's the money? [Laughter] I'm joking. It's——\nIt's a bunch of malarkey.\nBecause you notice I have never once—not one single time—suggested to the Justice Department what they should do or not do, relative to bringing a charge or not bringing a charge. I'm honest.\nThank you.\n[Several reporters continued to ask questions.]", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-the-united-kingdom"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India", "Date": "2023-06-22", "Text": "Please, be seated. Thank you.\nWell, good afternoon. The Prime Minister and I have just finished a very productive meeting.\nAnd the Prime Minister—I know you've got to get up to Capitol Hill very soon and to address the Joint Session of Congress. It's a testament to the strong and enduring and thoroughly bipartisan support that exists all across the United States for the friendship and partnership between India and the United States that the—they're anxiously waiting to hear you up on Capitol Hill.\nA partnership that is among the most consequential in the world, that is stronger, closer, and more dynamic than any time in history. Mr. Prime Minister, we've met many times over the past few years, most recently in Hiroshima at the G-7 summit. And each time, I was struck by our ability to find new areas of cooperation. Together, we're unlocking a shared future of what I believe to be unlimited potential.\nAnd with this visit, we're demonstrating once more how India and the United States are collaborating on nearly every human endeavor and delivering progress across the board, for—from designing new ways to diagnose and treat illnesses like cancer and diabetes; to collaborating on human spaceflight including sending an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station in 2024; to accelerating a global clean energy transition and tackling climate—the climate crisis we face; to harnessing our shared expertise on critical and emerging technologies like quantum computing and artificial intelligence to ensuring they are not used as tools of misinformation and oppression.\nWe are doubling down on our cooperation to secure our semiconductor supply chains, advancing Open RAN telecommunications networks, and growing our major defense partnership with the more joint exercises, more cooperation between our defense industries, and more consultation and coordination across all domains.\nOur economic relationship is booming. Trade between our countries has almost doubled over the past decade to more than $191 billion, supporting tens of thousands of good jobs in both India and the United States.\nAdd to that: One million American jobs across 44 States will by supported by the purchase of more than 200—more than 200—American-made Boeing aircraft by—that Air India is announcing earlier this year.\nAnd with this visit, Indian firms are announcing more than $2 billion—more than $2 billion—in new investments in manufacturing—in solar in Colorado, steel in Ohio, and optic fiber in South Carolina, and much more. Further proof that America's manufacturing is back.\nWe're expanding educational exchanges for our students, building on the record 125,000 student visas for Indians to study in the United States we issued last year and opening new consulates that's going to make it easier for our people to travel, work, and collaborate together.\nOn the issues that matter most and that will define the future, our nations look to one another, including on critical regional and global issues.\nAnd today we also talked about our shared efforts to mitigate the humanitarian tragedies unleashed by Russia's brutal war in Ukraine and to defend the core principles of the U.N. Charter: sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nWe discussed our work through the Quad and how India and the United States, together with Australia and Japan, can ensure the vital Indo-Pacific region remains free, open, prosperous, and secure.\nThrough our new I2U2 grouping with Israel and the U.A.E., we're building regional connections to the Middle East and spurring science-based solutions and—to the global challenges, like food security and clean energy.\nAnd this year, under India's leadership of the G-20, we're putting sustainable development at the center of the agenda. We're delivering meaningful action on low- and middle-income nations, including multilateral development bank reform, debt relief, and building resilient and equitable health systems. The bottom line is simple: We want people everywhere to have the opportunity to live in dignity.\nAnd let me be—close with this: Indians and Americans are both peoples who innovate and create, turn obstacles into opportunities, who find strength in community and family, and who cherish freedom and celebrate the democratic values of universal human rights, which face challenges around the world and each—and in each of our countries, but which remain so vital to the success of each of our nations: press freedom, religious freedom, tolerance, diversity.\nIndia now has the most populous country—is now the most populous country in the world. It's a democracy. And we understand that it is—has—it is the brilliance and the backbone of our people as diverse in talents and traditions that make us strong as a nation. It's democracies that do that.\nWe see that so clearly here in the United States where a vibrant Indian American community of more than 4 million strong contributes every single day to the writing of the future of our nation.\nIndian Americans of every background and faith, representing the full diversity of India, are pursuing their American dream while maintaining deep connections for their Indian heritage and families.\nThat makes us all stronger. That is a cornerstone of this essential partnership between India and the United States. And that is why I know the friendship between our nations is only going to grow as we face the future together.\nWell, the Congress is actually waiting to—and anxiously waiting to hear you.\nI'm told there are two questioners: Sabrina [Sabrina Siddiqui] from the Wall Street Journal and Kumar [Kumar Rakesh; Press Trust of India] from the Trust of India.\nAnd, Sabrina, you first.\nChina-U.S. Relations/India/Democratic Values\nThe answer to your first question is: No. You know, what—when we're talking to our allies and partners around the world, including India, we let the idea of my choosing and avoiding saying what I think is the facts with regard to the relationship with India—with China is—just not something I'm going to change very much.\nI think we—I believe that—and I've said this for some time—that the hysteria about the relationship with China is collapsing and moving, et cetera, et cetera—we had an incident that caused some confusion, you might say. But President—but Secretary Blinken had a great trip to China. I expect to be meeting with President Xi sometime in the future, in the near term. And I don't think it's had any real consequence.\nAnd what was your second question?\nWell, look, the Prime Minister and I had a good discussion about democratic values. And there is a—there is the—that's the nature of our relationship: We're straightforward with each other, and we respect each other.\nOne of the fundamental reasons that I believe the U.S.-China relationship is not in the space it is with the U.S.- Indian relationship is that there's an overwhelming respect for each other because we're both democracies. And it's a common democratic character of both our countries that—and our people—our diversity; our culture; our open, tolerant, robust debate.\nAnd I believe that we believe in the dignity of every citizen. And it is in America's DNA and, I believe, in India's DNA that the whole world—the whole world—has a stake in our success, both of us, in maintaining our democracies. It makes us appealing partners and enables us to expand democratic institutions across—around the world. And I believe this, and I still believe this.\nKumar.\nTackle what?\nAudience member.Climate change.\nClimate change. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.\nWell, first of all, I think it is the existential threat to humanity: climate change. It's the most serious problem we face as human beings. We have to keep it below 1.5 degrees Celsius. We've made enormous progress here in the United States on dealing with this issue by doing three things.\nNumber one, by insisting that we move our—every one of our industries into a position where they can take advantage of cheaper and more extensive and more available renewable energy, whether it's solar or wind or hydrogen and green hydrogen. There's a whole range of things we've been working on.\nIn addition to that, we find ourselves in a position that—what we've done is that we have significantly reduced the—for example, I made a commitment that we are going to make sure that by 2030, 30 percent of all our land and sea and oceans were—are—were in conservation, could not be developed. We're well on our way to doing that. And that's also absorbing carbon from the air as a consequence of that, because of the conservation.\nWe are in a position, as well, by—we have provided for significant increase in funding for a whole range of issues, but not just for the United States, but for the rest of the world.\nFor example, we're working with the G-7 to provide for infrastructure work for dealing with global warming on the continent of Africa: in Angola, building the largest solar project; moving ourselves—having railway to go all the way across the southern two-thirds—the—from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, in Africa, to be able to transport and do it cheaper and do it with less—how can I say it?—less carbon emissions.\nWe're trying to work with other countries to maintain their carbon sinks so they don't have to develop them like we did and causing pollution. And we're trying to figure out how to work out to pay them not to develop certain areas, like the Amazon in Brazil.\nBut there's a lot of technology that's available that we're sharing, and we share with one another. We've learned how to do solar energy, which is considerably cheaper than it is to—for fuel—for fossil fuels. The same way dealing with not just solar, but dealing with wind.\nAnd so there's a lot of the technology that we've developed. And we're well on our way, I think, to meeting the commitment we made to—that we made in Paris. And I—and we're prepared to share all of that with India, that has a desire to do the same.\nLet me add one thing. We have caused damage in the United States the way we developed over the last 300 years. And that's why I was able to convince my colleagues in the Congress to pass legislation—the largest climate fund ever in American—in the world history: $369 billion—$369 billion—to deal with the climate crisis.\nAnd we are doing it extensively now, and I think you're going to see significant progress.\nThank you all very, very much.\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-india"}
{"Title": "Interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN's \"Global Public Square\"", "Date": "2023-07-09", "Text": "Holding NATO together is really critical.\nI think we have enormous opportunities and I just want to finish the job.\nGood to be with you. Thanks for having me.\nI don't think it's ready for membership in NATO. But here's the deal. I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together because I believe Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops into Ukraine, and that was to break NATO. He was confident, in my view and many in the intelligence community, he was confident he could break NATO.\nSo holding NATO together is really critical. I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now, at this moment, in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then, you know, and I mean what I say, we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory as a commitment that we've all made no matter what.\nIf the war is going on, then we're all in a war. You know, we're in a war with Russia if that were the case. So I think we have to lay out a path for the rational path for Russia, for -- excuse me, for Ukraine, to be able to qualify to get into NATO. And we have -- when the very first time that I met with Putin two years ago in Geneva and he said I want commitments on no Ukraine and NATO, I said we're not going to do that because it's an open-door policy. We're not going to shut anybody out.\nNATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications and -- from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So in the meantime, though, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this, and one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide while the process was going on, and it's going to take a while, while that process was going on to provide security ala the security we provide for Israel, providing the weaponry and the needs, capacity to defend themselves if there is an agreement, if there is a cease-fire, if there is a peace agreement.\nAnd so I think we can work it out, but I think it's premature to say to call for a vote now because there is other qualifications that need to be met, including democratization and some of those issues.\nI am. I am. I have met recently with the Swedish prime minister here. Sweden is a -- has the same value set that we have in NATO. A small nation but has the capacity to defend itself. They know how to fight and they're -- and I think they should be a member of NATO. You know better than anyone, the holdup is Turkey. Turkey and Sweden is making adjustments in their law to relate to whether or not these people burning the Quran.\nWell, they aren't Swedes that are burning the Quran. They are migrants who are burning the Quran. And that puts -- that gives an excuse and/or it puts Erdogan in a tough spot at home. And so they're moving to stop that, number one. Number two, there is a -- Turkey is looking for modernization of F-16 aircraft. And Mitsotakis in Greece is also looking for some help. And so what I'm trying to quite frankly put together is a little bit of a consortium here where we're strengthening NATO in terms of the military capacity of both Greece as well as Turkey, and allow Sweden to come in. But it's a -- it's in play. It's not done.\nI'm hopeful. As a matter of fact I'm optimistic.\nTwo things, Fareed. I know it's a very difficult decision in my part. And by the way, I discussed this with our allies, discussed this with our friends up on the Hill, and we're in a situation where Ukraine continues to be brutally attacked across the board by munitions, by these cluster munitions that are -- have dud rates that are very, very low, I mean, very high that are a danger to civilians, number one.\nNumber two, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition. The ammunition that they used to call them 155-millimeter weapons. This is a war relating to munitions, and they are running out of that ammunition and we're low on it. And so what I finally did, I took the recommendation of the Defense Department to, not permanently, but to allow for in this transition period where we have more 155 weapons, these shells for the Ukrainians, to provide them with something that has a very low dud rate. It's about -- I think it's 1.50, which is the least likely to be blown.\nAnd it's not used in civilian areas. They're trying to get through those trenches and stop those tanks from rolling. And so -- but it was not an easy decision. And it's not -- we're not signatories of that agreement. But I -- it took me a while to be convinced to do it. But the main thing is they either have the weapons to stop the Russians now from their -- keeping them from stopping the Ukrainian offensive through these areas, or they don't. And I think they needed them.\n(END VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA: Next on GPS, America's secretary of the Treasury just wrapped up a visit to China on the heels of a similar visit by the secretary of State. Is this a sign of a thawing of relations or will tensions between two the great powers continue to rise?\nI'll ask President Biden about his China policy when we come back.\nYes.\nThe answer is I think there is a stable point. But, look, if you don't mind my saying, just before going on air we talked about things are changing in the world. China is influx right now as well. China has enormous potential capacity but enormous problems as well. And so there is two things that I have tried to do in terms of our China policy. And by the way, I have met first the person with Xi Jinping more than any other world leader. 68 hours alone he and I with an interpreter back when I was vice president all the way through because as you remember it was clear he was going to be president and it wasn't inappropriate for the president of the United States, Barack Obama, to be traveling the world with him.\nBut I traveled 17,000 miles with him when I was vice president in China. And so we understand each other I think fairly well, number one. Number two, everything is changing. You know, you heard me say it before. The world is an inflection point. No matter what was happening, China is in a different place right now internally. Internally. I'll give you an example. He often says to me -- not often, on two occasions, called me and said why am I criticizing what's going on with western China and slave labor, et cetera.\nAnd I said, remember, you told me that for China to be able to be secure, it needs to have one leader, a united China from Taiwan to the Tibetan Plateau, and that's when China has always done, we're going all the way back to the time when we have (INAUDIBLE). And I said -- and so for me not to talk about -- and you told me for you not to talk about unity of China would be able to lead. I said, well, the United States is the most unique nation in the world. We are organized based on an idea, for real. And not only idea. We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal, et cetera.\nAnd we live up to it, we never walked away from it. And for me, for an American president to remain silent on slave labor would be totally inconsistent. And so I think -- well, I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'm sorry to go on so long, is that I think there is a way to resolve -- to establish a working relationship with China that benefits them and us. And the last thing I'll tell you on this, is I also called him after he had that meeting with the Russians about this new relationship, et cetera.\nAnd I said, this is not a threat, this is an observation. I said, since Russia went into Ukraine, 600 American corporations have pulled out of Russia. And you've told me that your economy depends on investment from Europe and the United States. And be careful. Be careful. And so he --\nHe listened and he didn't argue. And if you notice, he has not gone full bore in Russia. He is -- he talks about nuclear war being a disaster. You know, there is such a thing as security that is needed. Anyway, so, I think there is a way we can work through this and that's why I spent so much time beefing up -- I think if I told you three years ago, which I had written about in my notes, that I was going to get Japan deeply involved. Have them change their defense budget, have them work -- not that I've done it, but work with South Korea, work something out.\nWe're going to put together the Quad which is India, Australia, the United States and Japan. I got a call from him on that. He said why are you doing that. I said we're not doing that to surround you, we're doing that to maintain stability in the Indian Ocean and in the South China Sea. Because we believe the rules of the road about what constitutes international air space, international space and the water should be maintained. And so I just think it's going to take a little time. But, and where\nit goes, depends a lot on what he's able to do internally in terms of his economy.\nOh, yes, I think he does. I mean, you know, I'm confident he wants to have the largest economy in the world and have us -- the largest military capacity in the world.\nI think so. Not all of them, but he says, he pointed out to me, he said we weren't there when those rules were written about international air space and so on.\nAnd, but I don't think he wants -- he's looking for war conflict, expansion of territory. And he, look, I sometimes say to my colleagues, I've spent over 180 hours talking with my NATO colleagues and European colleagues in person or around Zoom, I say to them, do you know anybody, any world leader who'd trade places with Xi Jinping? OK. I'll take their problems and you take mine. I don't know anybody would. Because it's not that he's a bad guy or a good guy, the circumstances are enormously complicated.\nFor example, you know, the whole notion of, you know, this new ring road that's going to put around -- going to invest in other nations. Well, it's ended up producing (INAUDIBLE). You know, these countries are in real trouble. And so, but it requires us to be more responsible. The West. I've been pushing very hard to get our European colleagues to invest in infrastructure in Africa, in South America, and to generate the kind of growth that they should have and could have because we're the ones that caused the environmental problems.\nWe clear-cut everything. And now we're telling them, no, everybody slow up. But I guess what I'm saying is I think there are positive answers to the dilemmas that exist without worrying about whether or not China is going to rule the world.\nWell, first of all the Israeli president is going to be coming, we have other contacts. I've been, I think it is fair to say, an unyielding supporter of Israel for over -- I've only been around a couple of years, but for as long as I've been around. And Bibi, I think is trying to work through how he could work through his existing problems in terms of his coalition. He has -- I'm one of those that believes Israel is almost a security risk for a two-state solution.\nI think it's a mistake to think that as some members of his cabinet and this is one of the most extremist members of cabinets that I've seen. I go all the way back to Golda Meir and, you know, not that she was extreme but I go back to that era. I think that the fact that the Palestinian Authority has lost its credibility, not necessarily because of what Israel has done, just because it is just lost its credibility, number one.\nAnd number two, created a vacuum for extremism among the Palestinians. They are -- there are some very extreme elements. So it's not all Israel now in the West Bank, all Israel's problem. But they are a part of the problem. And particularly those individuals in the cabinet who say, they have no right -- we could settle anywhere we want, they have to right to be here, et cetera. And I think we -- we're talking with them regularly, trying to tamp down what is going on and hopefully Bibi will continue to move toward moderation and changing the (INAUDIBLE).\nWe're a long way from there. We've got a lot to talk about. For example, that trip I went, which was criticized for my going, a number of things have happened on that trip. On that trip I was able to negotiate over flights so Israeli could know -- Israeli aircraft could now over fly Saudi Arabia, number one. Number two, the price of oil is actually down, not up, and it's not because they have done one thing or the other. But the world is changing, our policies relative to renewables are real.\nNumber three, we found ourselves in a circumstance where the war if Yemen is essentially for a year now been -- it's ended -- peace is being kept. So, we're making progress in the region. And it depends upon the conduct and what is asked of us for them to recognize Israel. Quite frankly -- I don't think they have much of a problem with Israel, quite frankly. And whether or not we would provide a means by which they could have civilian nuclear power and/or be a guarantor of their security, that is -- I think that is a little way off.\nWell, let me just -- they're not right or wrong. It is -- look, to use the phrase again, I think we're at an inflection point. I think the world is changing and I think I -- there is one thing that comes with age, if you're being honest about it your whole life and that is some wisdom. I think we're on the cusp of being able to make significant positive changes in the world. Really honest to God do.\nYou've seen what we've done in Europe. Europe is more united than it has ever been since World War II -- end of World War II. You've seen what we've been able to do in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. We've united that part of the world including the 50 --basically 50 island nations that are participating, who will be here by the way shortly.\nI think we're putting the world together in a way that is going to make things significantly -- how can I say it -- more secure for people. We're uniting democracies -- have a possibility of uniting democracies in a way that hadn't happened ever. And, so, I think that whether it is the far east, whether it is NATO, whether it is Europe, whether it is what is going on in Africa, I think we have enormous opportunities. And I think I just want to finish the job. And I think we can do that in the next six years.\nThank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-fareed-zakaria-cnns-global-public-square-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland in Helsinki, Finland", "Date": "2023-07-13", "Text": "And I like it here even better. [Laughter]\nPresident Niinistö.Yes. [Laughter] And by the way, first time we met, also in Helsinki, I was the Speaker of Parliament when you visited.\nI remember.\nPresident Niinistö.So we have had a lot of discussions during the last couple years. I want to, once again, thank you for the strong support you have given all the time.\nIt's my honor.\nPresident Niinistö.The new era in Finnish security policy has begun, and you will be one of those who brought it to history.\nI also want to thank you for the Vilnius meeting. It was very touching to feel the unity between allies. And I think it was greatly created by you.\nWe had possibilities of discussing bilaterally today. I took up the negotiations of our defense cooperation agreement. We are going to continue our security discussion bilat, and that is of vital importance to Finland.\nIn the same time, also, Sweden and Denmark are having similar discussions. And at the end, it seems that all the five Nordic countries will have a bilateral agreement with U.S.A.\nTechnology is one of the key words for the future. There are elements like artificial intelligence, quantum technology, sky technology. All that is leading our way to the future. And we have to make sure that it's leading our way in a very secure way. And that demands responsibility of those who know how. And that is why it is very important to coordinate and cooperate with our knowledge and resources forward in this sector.\nWe also had a discussion on our neighbor, and I think that we both share similar views. The war in Ukraine was also discussed. We both see that we will continue support to Ukraine, which is defending not only herself, but also all the values we represent in the western world.\nWe also had a meeting with the Nordic family. It is a tradition, which started during President Obama's time, and it has been a very valuable tool for us to get—even better understand each other's security and technology. They're also discussed there. And a lot of time and thoughts were presented on environmental issues.\nSo, once again, it has been great to have you here.\nWell, thank you, Mr. President. It's been great to be here.\nLook, it's an honor to be with you and our other Nordic friends. We just finished, I would suggest, a very productive U.S.-Nordic leaders summit on the heels of the historic NATO summit in Vilnius and—where Finland took its place at the table as an—as our newest ally. We've always been friends, but our newest official ally member of NATO.\nAnd I also want to thank Minister Kristersson of Sweden, who will soon be joining NATO, and Prime Minister Støre of Norway. She—we've had a great relationship. And Frederiksen of Denmark, and the Minister Jakoblindóttir [Jakobsdóttir; White House correction] of Ireland—or—\"daughter of Ireland.\" You can tell that's a Freudian slip; I'm thinking of home. The daughter of Iceland.\nAnd I want to say I think we've had a very productive summit. We discussed, Mr. President, where we stand at an inflection point in history where the decisions we make now are going to determine the course of the history for the next four or five, six decades.\nAnd this week, we affirmed how Finland and the United States, together—together with allies and partners—are working in lockstep to set us on a stronger, safer, and more secure path, not just for Europe, not just for NATO, but for the world.\nIn Vilnius, NATO met with 33 nations for the first—31 nations for the first time. We showed the world our alliance is more united than ever. And soon, it will be 32 allies, thanks to an agreement with Turkey to move Sweden's accession protocols forward.\nAnd as capable partners and committed democracies, both Finland and Sweden are going to add significantly to the strength, security, and unanimity of NATO. And a stronger NATO makes the entire world stronger.\nSorry, what, I'm sorry? I didn't hear the last part of your question.\nI absolutely guarantee it. There is no question. There's overwhelming support from the American people. There's overwhelming support from the Members of the Congress, both House and Senate. In both parties, notwithstanding the fact there are some extreme elements of one party, we will stand together.\nThe American people have known for the—since the end of World War II and the formation of NATO that our security rests in the unanimity among European and transatlantic partner—us. And so this is—you know, no one can guarantee the future, but this is the best bet anyone could make.\nLet me be clear: I didn't say we didn't guarantee—we couldn't guarantee the future. You can't tell me whether you're going to be able to go home tonight. No one can be sure what they're going to do.\nI'm saying, as sure as anything can possibly be said about American foreign policy, we will stay connected to NATO—connected to NATO, beginning, middle, and end. We're a transatlantic partnership. That's what I've said.\nPresident Niinistö.It seems that the President has answered your problems. [Laughter]\nBut I have to tell you that during this process, I met approximately—President many times—but I would say about 50 people from Congress and Senate. And I think the message was quite clear, quite united. And I have no reason to doubt about U.S.A. policies in the future.\nLet me say one more thing. We learned a hard lesson. Peace and security in Europe is essential to U.S. security and peace. The idea that there could be conflict in Europe among our friends and us not engaged has never happened in modern history. That's why we're staying together.\nOh, I have to call on somebody. I'm sorry.\nFirst of all, no one can join NATO while the war—a war is going on, where a NATO nation is being attacked, because that guarantees that we're in a war and we're in a third world war. So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.\nThe issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to be—what vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, \"I'm out.\"\nBut what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do. But there is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine. He's already lost that war. Imagine if—even if—anyway. He's already lost that war.\nI'm sorry?\nWell, I don't think the war can go on for years for two reasons. Number one, I don't think that they—that Russia could maintain the war forever—number one—in terms of their resources and capacity.\nNumber two, I think that there is going to be a circumstance where, eventually, President Putin is going to decide it's not in the interest of Russia—economically, politically, or otherwise—to continue this war. But I can't predict exactly how that happens.\nMy hope is, and my expectation is, you'll see that Ukraine makes significant progress on their offensive and that it generates a negotiated settlement somewhere along the line.\nOh, I'm serious about a prisoner exchange. I'm serious about doing all we can to free Americans who are being illegally held in Russia or anywhere else for that matter. And that process is underway.\nOkay.\nSorry, I—what nation?\nOh, I see.\nWell, first of all, the context in which I said that was: The gentleman who occupies a seat on the other side of the—your border, in Moscow, said he wanted—I said he wanted the Findalization [Finlandization; White House correction] of NATO. I said it was more likely he's going to get the NATOization of Finland. [Laughter] That's what—that's the context in which that was said.\nAnd what was the second part of your question?\n——Finland is already a strong, vibrant nation. I think what Finland's joining NATO does—and with Sweden as well—when the Nordic countries are all members of NATO: It just makes the world safer. It significantly increases the prospect that there is less likely to be war.\nWe'll—we're deadly earnest about the notion. We'll defend every single inch of NATO territory. And now we're going to—we're on the way of getting to 32 NATO nations. That's a significant commitment. And so the likelihood of any nation voluntarily deciding they're going to attack one of the nations or Finland is highly unlikely.\nAnd so—but if it were to, they understand they're not just attacking Finland; they're attacking 31 other countries.\nOh, I'm sorry. I guess it's Arlette [Arlette Saenz] from CNN.\nWell, first of all, they already interfered in American elections. So that would not be anything new. They did that last time—they tried to.\nBut with regard to—I don't think there's any real prospect—you never know—but of Putin using nuclear weapons. Not only has the West, but China and the rest of the world has said: \"That's—don't go there. Don't go there.\" Number two.\nNumber three, I think that determining what happens to Prigozhin and what happens to Vilnius—I mean—excuse me, what happens when we discussed this in Vilnius is, God only knows what he's likely to do. Well, I'm not even sure—we're not even sure where he is and what relationship he has. If I were he, I'd be careful what I ate. I'd be keeping my eye on my menu.\nBut all kidding aside, I who knows? I don't know. I don't think any of us know for sure what the future of Prigozhin is in Russia. And so I don't know how to answer that question beyond that.\nI'd be willing to talk to him if I thought there was any possibility of him changing this ridiculous position he has. He's jeopardizing U.S. security by what he's doing.\nI expect the Republican Party to stand up—stand up—and do something about it. They—it's within their power to do that.\nThe idea that we don't have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the idea that we have all these—all these promotions that are in abeyance right now and we don't know what's going to happen; the idea that we're injecting into fundamental foreign policy decisions what, in fact, is a domestic social debate on social issues is bizarre.\nI don't ever recall that happening, ever. And it's just totally irresponsible, in my view.\nAnd I just think that—I mean, I'm confident that the mainstream Republican Party no longer—does not support what he's doing. But they've got to stand up and be counted. That's how it ends.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-sauli-niinisto-finland-helsinki-finland"}
{"Title": "Interview with Jay Shetty of On Purpose Podcast", "Date": "2023-07-31", "Text": "How are you, man?\nGood to see you.\nWell, thank you.\n[Begin clip] The day will come when you open that closet door and you smell the fragrance of her dresses, or you're going by that park where you walked with your child or your -- or your wife or your husband or the thing that reminds you that, for the longest time, will just bring a tear to your eye, but eventually, every once in a while, will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear in your eye.\nWhen that happens, you know you're going to make it.\nThank you. I'm flattered you'd want to interview me.\nThe earliest memory I have is -- there's two of them. One is there was a bully in the neighborhood, lived down the -- an area called the plot, and we lived up the hill. And I was out with my friends in the alley behind our house, and my mother was at the pantry, looking out. The tough guy in the neighborhood smacked me. He's a couple of years older than me. And then I came in holding my face, and my grandfather was at the kitchen table and said, \"What's the matter, Joe?\" And he said, \"That's a shame.\" I walked in and my mother said, \"Joey, go back out there.\" So, go back out there. She said, \"Walk up to -- wait till he walks up to you. As soon as he does, smack him right in the nose.\" In the nose. She said, \"I'll give you $0.50 if you do it.\" And I said, \"Why, Mom?\" She said, \"You won't be able to walk in that alley again if you don't.\" I was scared to death. I walked out, popped him in the nose. It bled. He ran, and I thought, huh?\nIt worked. But -- and I -- I think the lesson I learned the most, though, is I used to stutter badly, and I would talk -- talk like -- like -- like -- like that. And then I'd catch my rhythm and be able -- and it was something that I thought was the worst curse could happen to me because everybody makes fun of it.\nI think everybody does.\nI -- I was the runt of the litter. No, I really was. I was a little guy, and I was a relatively good athlete even when I was a kid, but I literally was the runt of the litter.\nOh, no, I think maybe it is. You know, I -- I had a similar thing. I -- when I was in -- I went to Catholic grade school and high school. And you sit -- in those days, you sat in alphabetical order. I was in the first row. Biden, four people down. In reading class, everybody read a paragraph. I got to my paragraph, and I remember what it was because I used to try to memorize it rather than have to look at the word when I was rereading it [inaudible] And it said, \"And he was a gentlemen.\" And then -- and the teacher said, \"What's that, Mr. Biden?\" He wanted -- she wanted to say gentleman, but it was easier to not stutter and say gentlemen. I said gentlemen. She said, \"Mr. Biden, what is that?\" And I got up and walked out and walked home, which is about two miles. And my mother was sitting there tapping the table when I walked in. She said, \"Get in the car.\" Went down the car and we walked in and went to the principal's office. She sat me outside the door. The door was -- crying. I was one of those opaque glasses -- glass windows, and it didn't go to the ceiling. Anyway, to make a long story short, she said, \"I'd like to speak to the teacher,\" my mother said. And she said, Ms. Biden -- she said, \"I'd like to speak to the teacher.\" So, the teacher walks in, looked at me like you're in trouble now, Biden. Walked in and sat down. There was a crack in the door. I'll never forget this. And my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, and she -- she looked and -- like I said, \"What did you say to my son?\" She said, \"Did you say ba-ba-Biden?\" \"So, I was just trying to make a point, Mrs. Biden.\" She said, \"If you ever do that again, I'll come back and rip that bonnet off your head. Do you understand me?\" Swear to God.\nGet up, walk down. Go back to class, Joey. But, you know, it's -- everybody has something that is tough, particularly when you're younger, and it makes such a difference when -- when somebody reaches out. I'm sure you had -- also had some experience where someone say, \"Come on.\" Like, for example, there's more than a handful of young stutters, they're not so young anymore, that I still keep in touch with it. One young kid, he introduced me when I ran for president. It took such courage because he talk -- talks -- talk like -- like that. And he practiced and he practiced and he practiced. But it's had a profound impact on his life. Another young man, when I was vice president, he was -- I could tell -- you can tell a stutterer if you're a stutterer just by -- when he was in line with his mom. It was in Tennessee, and I was doing a thing for Al Gore. And -- and she introduced her son. And I could see him go, his lips. I said -- I said, \"Hey, I'm about to finish my speech. Why don't you come help me write it?\" And then the mother looked at me and he looked at me. I took him in, and I showed him how I marked up my speeches so that I could get a little cadence with what I did. Did you ever see the movie The King's Speech?\nWell, the gentleman who had that -- had a copy of The King's Speech, who did it, sent me a copy. And I don't know if I had my book with me, but there's a -- one of these days, I'll show you my speeches. I looked at it, and he marks it up the same way. Every speech I mark up, it's the same way.\nSee the slash marks I put on?\nWell, this is to help me. But, you know, there were people who reached out to me, too. Maybe that impediment was the best thing that ever happened to me.\nIt's kind of human nature for most people. When you understand the pain someone is feeling, your first instinct is -- look, we -- we have an expression in the family from the time I was a kid. It's all about showing up. To just being there. I mean, I imagine the times when you were down because they're making fun of your Indian heritage in an all-white population, that having someone come up and say, \"Hey, come on, you and me, let's do boom,\" makes a difference.\nWell, it really is all about reaching out, isn't it? I mean, for real. Think of all the young people today. I think that there's more anxiety and loneliness today than there's been in a long, long time. You know my friend, I appointed Admiral Vivek Murthy. He was telling me about, you know, the percentage of young people today who are feeling lonely, alone. And sometimes, it's just -- just touching, just showing up. I used to get -- my deceased son, Beau, who should be sitting here instead of me, would always say, \"Dad, you know what? I'm trying to make that call.\" You don't -- I'd -- I'd get in a plane and go home. And because someone had a serious problem, lost of wife, a daughter. And I -- and I -- and he said, \"Dad, you don't have time.\" When he passed away, the hundreds of people who told me how he called, he showed up. He was there. And -- because of people who showed up for me, too. It just really matters.\nI had an overwhelming advantage in the loss, and that was I had a really close family who was there. For example, when my wife and daughter were killed, my first wife and my two boys were very badly injured. A tractor-trailer broadsided. I was -- was not in the accident. When I got home from the hospital, my sister and her husband already gave up their apartment and moved in to help me raise my kid. My brother, we lived in a suburban area. It was more country than suburban. And there was a little barn, a garage barn. My -- my brother came, and he turned the loft of the barn into an apartment for himself. They were there for me all the time. That was a gigantic difference. My best friend in my life are my sister and my brothers. And -- and so, I had an enormous advantage. And I think that when you see people who are going through something tough, it does matter if you reach out. I mean, it -- it does matter. Like, for example, you know, you have -- when you're a senator for all the years I was in a small state, you know so many people and people would pass away. You'd show up at the wake or the funeral no matter what was happening. I learned it early on. People would stop and just come and throw their arms around me because if they know you know the pain they feel, they get some solace in it. It's not always easy, but it's -- it just matters just to -- just to reach out. Let people know you see them.\nYeah. Yeah.\nWell, I was raising a family for real, an extended family, my grandparents as well, where my dad had an expression: Family is the beginning, middle, and end. There's a rule in the family growing up. Not a joke. We didn't know it at the time, but whenever you wanted to speak to your mother or father, I mean, they said, can we -- he had a problem.\nIf they got a problem, you're there to listen. I have seven grandkids. Four of them -- all five of them old enough to talk on the phone. You know, every day, I either text them or call them. And as matter of fact, during campaign, they were -- they were having a -- I didn't realize they're having an interview, the four oldest grandchildren. They said -- and just at the time when they said -- they call me pop. Pop calls us every day or texts us every day. And I called them. The phone rang.\nWhile -- I give you my word, I had no idea they're in an interview. But it's -- look, I -- I just think being there is -- is important and -- and makes such a difference, I think, and knowing that someone's going to be there for you, just to listen, just to -- just to hold you. Just to hug you.\nI agree. But it's just -- half is just showing up. Even people you don't know that well, but you've met. The fact you'd call and say I'm thinking of you. I learned this from my experience. The day will come when you open that closet door and you smell the fragrance of her dresses or you walk -- going by that park where you -- where you -- where you walked with your child or your -- or your wife or your husband or the thing that reminds you, and for the longest time, will just bring a tear to your eye. But eventually, every once in a while, will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye. When that happens, you know you're going to make it. That's the moment you know I make -- doesn't mean you still don't cry. Doesn't mean the pain still isn't -- isn't real, even years later. But you know you can make it. I think there's an advantage, sometimes, if you have deep faith, whether you're, you know, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim, you know, whatever. My family, when they want to get an important message to me, they tape it on the mirror of the bathroom. I'm serious. Not a joke.\nYeah. No, it's -- it's on the mirror. I guess I was down early on, miss -- not going to be 10 years ago. I was down or something. And my daughter actually taped on my -- she's a social worker, taped on my mirror, happiness is something -- something to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to. And, Dad, you have all those things. Just to remind you, you know\nWell, I -- I have a rule that I thought that everybody in my -- my staff knew because I -- I had -- when I was a senator for a long time, at one point, I don't know how they measured it, but I had the same staff longer than anybody in -- in -- in the Senate at the time. For example, we were doing a very, very important Supreme Court hearing. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And we worked on it very hard and did all the research and, you know -- anyway. And there was one young man who people say he was invaluable because he's the guy who knew all the detail about certain things. And I found out that he was having trouble at home. And I said, \"I want you to go home. Don't come to the hearing.\" He said, \"I can't.\" \"Go home. Go home. And you know why? Because I would go home.\" I have a thousand bosses, but only one me. No one -- and so I know when I had crashes at home, raising the boys, I went home. I don't know how many years ago it was, but in this job and as vice president, another person was having some trouble at home. And I found out, but I said, \"Go home.\" They said, \"No, no, I can't. I got to.\" I said, \"If you don't go home, I'm going to fire you. Go home.\" A relationship is a hell of a lot more important than whatever you're doing for me. So, that's a rule we have. Not a joke. Absolutely not. And you never have to tell me why. All you got to say is I'm not going to be in. I take it your word. If it turns out you're playing games with me, I'll learn. But I -- I know you too well. Take the time because you're not getting any better than your relationship. And it's a little bit what you were just talking about. And -- and, you know, I think -- you have to ask my staff. I don't know. But I think they -- as long as they know, that's more important, more important than doing whatever specific thing you're doing at that moment for me.\nWell, because there's only one advantage of getting older. You've had a lot of experience and -- and you can apply a little bit of wisdom. It's really critical.\nAnd by the way, there's a selfish aspect to it, because when you have a problem with someone you love or some problem, you're -- you know, you've got to deal with it.\nExactly right.\nI don't know how to separate the three. Many times, my heart brings me to the problem and my gut tells me what I think I want to do. But my head, meaning the research that back -- sometimes says that's the wrong answer. I think you're driven by a value set. You know what you value. You know what you think is important in life. You know what you think is consequential. And I think people who know what they value, doesn't mean they're better or worse. But if you follow your value set, to me, they're kind of basic things. My dad used to have an expression, for real. He said, \"Joey, everyone's entitled to be treated with dignity. Everybody.\" Dignity was his word. Dignity. And what I find myself looking through the prism, for example, I was at an event the other day where I was talking, and I -- we're talking about a problem a mom was having, providing for the health -- the needs of a child, of actually a teenager. I said, \"All I can think of when hearing about not being able to afford the treatment was how she's deprived of her dignity.\" Imagine being a parent and you can't do anything about it because you don't have the financial wherewithal, because you don't have the connection, because you don't know where to go. It's a little bit like, you know, I think the most dangerous, the most hated word in the English language and any other language translated is cancer. You have cancer. It just strikes fear in everybody. Well, it's one thing to get an analysis by a great doctor, but you still need someone to guide you through. It's complicated. And we're finding significant breakthroughs in cancer. But you need someone to sort of lead you through who knows about it. I think it's the same way with about any problem people have. If there's a way to let people know there's an avenue, there's a way through. You know, I used to have a friend named Bob Gold, who -- who -- who died of a heart attack. And I used to say, \"Bob, do you understand me?\" He said, \"Joe, I -- I understand you. I overstand you.\" But you got to know how to know. And -- and that's why we can be so -- little things that can be of enormous value. It's like, you know, you're walking across an intersection. They don't let me do that anymore, but you walk across the intersection and there's a, you know, an elderly man or woman knowing they're waiting to see if they have enough time. Just grabbing their hand and walk them across. It's a -- it's a little tiny thing, but it -- the anxiety it relieves.\nI think so. I have to admit, when you've been through something that's been particularly difficult, helping someone going through it again forces you to relive your experience. Like, for example, the people I admire when we have functions where we're trying to make a point of how we can help someone with health care, whatever it is. The people who've been through it who show up and support it, I always compliment them because it's like it happened yesterday when you start to focus on. And it's hard. We underestimate what we can do. Not -- I am not -- I don't know about time being president, I mean just what we can do in terms of dealing with people. I try to understand what is motivating the other person when I'm doing things internationally or when I -- personally. Because if you can understand what motivates them, there's a shot. Even with the bad guys, you can break through and get something done. There's a way to expose the meanness without causing direct conflict. For example, I remember, I went to a Catholic grade school. We didn't often get invited to the cotillion, which was at the local school down the street at the Mount Pleasant School. And so, I got invited, and I was going to go. I was all excited about going. I think it was ninth grade, maybe it's eighth grade, a little dance. And there was a guy who was a good athlete. I was a relatively good athlete, and he was a good athlete from that school, the other school, big guy. Became friends. But -- so, I'm getting dressed, and I didn't have a shirt to wear. So, my mother got my uncle's shirt, who was a smaller man than my dad and French cuffs and rolled up the cuffs so that look like it -- it fit. And I couldn't find my dad's -- we couldn't find my dad's cufflinks, so my mom went and got a nut and a bolt. I wonder why she was down downstairs in the laundry room, looking for it and put them on. I said, \"Mom, I can't do this. They'll make fun of me. I'll be embarrassed.\" She said, \"Anybody comes up and said that, then you look at them and say,\" and here's this gentleman to say -- this guy, Frank, came up to me and said, \"Hey, look at Biden. Look what he's got here. Hey.\" And I looked at him and said, \"You don't have a pair of these?\" And he said, \"Well, uh, yeah, yeah, I got a pair.\" But I'm serious.\nYou know, it's hard to explain. I get credit for -- these days for sort of holding the international community together, and I try to understand what the circumstance the other world leader is facing and see if there's a way -- what I -- what needs to be done, there's a way through that he doesn't or she doesn't have to make a great sacrifice to do what she's doing but help make the case why they're helping others. But there's ways to do that. And it doesn't require the person -- if there's -- they have a fundamental difference with you on a subject. But if they're doing something because they don't have the political bandwidth to be able to do it at home, you can provide it. I will say to some leader sometimes, \"Well, why don't you let me criticize you for this or thank you for that or what.\" And most of the time -- now, you're going to do that off the top of your head. You got to know some of these people. They'll go, OK, or why don't you -- why don't you criticize me? Why don't you criticize me for my not doing something? And then I'll respond and say, OK, and then you can do what you want to do. It's just basic human nature. But I think -- I think trying to figure out what leeway a person has. I don't expect everybody to -- that I'm dealing with to appear in the second edition of Profiles in Courage, nor me. I mean, it's hard. But there's ways you can work -- not always, but you can work through things where you can allow the other person to save face and still get to where you want to go.\nAnd sometimes, it works with when you're working with two people.\nTo get that done.\nBut it's -- it's just trying to figure out what is really -- what impediments are in their way to keep them from being able to do what you know, you feel in your -- your gut you know they know they should do.\nUh-oh.\nI guess the best advice I ever received is show up. Just show up. Be there and get up. My mother used to say, \"Joey, get up. Never bow, never been, never -- get up. Just get up.\" And -- but showing up is just -- that's a big part. And I guess the worst advice I've ever received was holding a grudge because lots of times when people do something that is really not good, it's because they were fearful when they did it. Not fearful of you, but their circumstance. And it gets you nowhere, which means people doubt if I'm really Irish. The joke inside was Biden is really Irish. But all kidding aside, remembering is important, but holding a grudge is -- is not helpful.\nWell, my best friend is my wife. A woman who is probably had more to do with my success than anyone is my sister Valerie and my brother Jim. And I think that's the place where I go most. But also, I have a great advantage. Over the years, I've -- I've -- I've grown to have some great, great relationships with people I've worked with and/or -- or one of my staff. And I think most of my staff would tell you, the senior staff, is I don't treat them like they work for me. I treat them, which they are. They know the reason I hire them. I want them to know more than I know. And there are some things that -- that I seek advice from -- from a religious perspective, but that's really personal.\nNo, it's not true. I love it. I read all this. What I did tell her --\nAnd I -- and the same with -- no man deserves one great love, let alone two. For real. The two women that I married, one passed away, were women I knew when I went out with them the first time, I wanted to marry them. My first wife, I -- I told her when I met her, we went to -- I went -- I had $89 tax return. I'm at Five Guys down to Florida. And -- and I don't drink. So, I was bored with all that. So, I went to -- with three, I went to Nassau. Before, you could apply for 25 bucks round trip. And I met my -- my deceased wife, and I told her when -- when -- when I hung out with her for four days down there on the beach and -- that I was going to marry her. And she looked at me and said, \"I think so.\" And I started commuting every day, every weekend when I was -- I was a senior in college. That's how I ended up at Syracuse. She's in there. And my present wife was -- it was a blind date that my brother set up for us. And I knew it when I saw her. I -- I was on that 10 most bachelors list for five years, and it's not a fun thing because there were a lot of them. Don't get me wrong, a lot of nice people, but I just kind of given up on -- I was thinking I could have a -- and I got the blind date. I'll never forget, my brother said, \"You like her. She doesn't like politics.\"\nMission Impossible.\nBoth. Look, I -- one of the problems I have is I don't, and I should, I don't watch much television. No. And it's -- it's not because I'm above it or anything like that. It's just that, for example, for 36 years after the accident occurred and I commuted every day, 300 miles a day. And -- and -- and the press actually, I had one -- I got to know all the conductors so well. They became friends. And one day, as vice president, I was going home on the train, which the Secret Service doesn't like because there's so many opportunities to interrupt the train. And this particular, I'm not going to embarrass him and say his name, company, grabbed me in the cheek, and he said, \"Joey, baby.\" I thought they were going to shoot him. Anyway. I said, no, no, he's a friend. He said, \"I just read in the paper, you traveled 1,100,000 miles on Air Force planes,\" because you got a list how many miles you're traveling. And he said, \"Big deal.\" He said, \"Joey, we had a retirement dinner. So, you know what we figured out? You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?\" I said no. He said, \"1,200,000 miles, 119 days a year, 300 a day -- 300 miles round trip, 36 years plus --\" My point was, I was on a train lot. And so, when I get home, there wasn't much to watch. I mean, not it was the watch, but I'd -- I'd always make sure -- I think -- and I think, you know, you ever -- all your guests know this that children need to know that they're the most important thing in your life. So, even if I got home late, I'd climb in bed or my two boys at the time and just even if they're asleep and get up in the morning. And it wasn't like Ozzie and Harriet, I wasn't fixing their breakfast. But I'd be there and have breakfast with them. They'd take off for school. I take off for the train. So, I've been back and forth so much I haven't -- I just haven't watched many. And by the way, there's a lot of good stuff, I'm sure. I mean, every once in a while I turn it on. And by the way, they got a great advantage here. You got a movie theater.\nYeah. And they -- they tell me I -- I get this list what movies are in. And we have the -- the -- the new one, that's the -- oh, the --\nI haven't either. Yeah.\nOK. Very nice. Amazing. All right. And fifth and final question, we asked this question to every guest who has ever been on the show, but it truly is unique asking you this question. If you could create one law in the world that everyone had to follow, what would it be? I don't think it's a matter of being able to have any one law that could change people's attitudes. I think -- I'm optimistic. I think we have -- we're on the cusp -- we're at a time of real change. And -- and we're at an inflection point in world history. Whether I'm president or not, things are going to change drastically. And you see it happening all around the world. And we have an enormous opportunity. But the thing I want to want to -- want to change is the American attitude that we can do anything. We can do anything. There's nothing we've ever set our mind to that we've not been able to do if we've done it together. For real. And so, I laid out four things that I thought were critically important in my State of the Union. One was to make a fundamental change in cancer treatment. We can cure a lot. And that's why I've put another $6 billion. I mean, pick the impossible thing. I have -- Caroline Kennedy gave me a copy of President Kennedy's -- part of President Kennedy's speech when about going to the moon. He said, because we refused to postpone. We have to refuse to postpone anymore. There's so much we can do. And I mean it. I believe it with every fiber of my being. I've been doing this a long time, and I've never been more optimistic about our chances than now. That's why when I ran, I said I ran for three reasons. One, to restore the soul of America's sense of decency, just the way we talk to one another. Secondly, to build this country from the middle out and the bottom up. The wealthy still do very well, but everybody has a shot. And thirdly, to unite the country. And I think we can do it. I really genuinely do. And -- but then again, as my -- often referred to, I'm a cockeyed optimist. But -- but I really believe it.\nThis one. My dad was a -- was a real gentleman and a well-read man. Never got a chance to go to college. And he'd always said, \"Joey, never explain, never complain.\" And so, we were having my fourth reelection effort as a senator in the late '90s, and my dad was over at our house to, you know, to be there with me. And I was standing on this back porch, overlooking this pond. I built a smaller home when the home we had, everybody moved out. But it sits on a pond, a 10-acre pond. And I was saying, my deceased wife, she lived in Lake Skaneateles, and the Finger Lakes is beautiful. She -- and I said, you know, I wish Neilia could have seen this. And so -- and my dad thought I was going to feel sorry for myself. So, he came. He said, \"I'll be back.\" And he took off and he went up to the local Hallmark store and came back with this cartoon. This is his philosophy in life. It's Hagar the Horrible. Lightning strikes. His boat's going down. He's looking up to God and having to say why me? The next frame of voice [inaudible] comes by, why not? My dad would always say, \"What makes you so special? You don't have these problems.\" I'll put it down here. The other ones, there's a bunch there, but --\nAnything you want to highlight?\nI'm probably boring the hell out of you.\nWell, like I said, my dad really was one of these guys and -- and I was about -- and so was my mother's side of the family. That family, my dad would say, is the beginning, the middle, and the end. And I believe it is. I mean, I know what you're trying to do is all those folks out there that are lonely and all those folks out there that are feeling uneasy. All those folks out there that aren't sure. I don't know. I just -- just sometimes, just reaching out. It makes a difference.\nThank you.\nYou're doing good work for people. I really mean it. Thank you.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jay-shetty-purpose-podcast"}
{"Title": "Interview with Stephanie Abrams of The Weather Channel in Arizona", "Date": "2023-08-09", "Text": "I think it's cruel. I think it's outrageous. I think it's consistent with what the governor down there is doing. You know, they have more cheaper electric -- excuse me, cheaper wind and solar energy than any other state. And he wants to cut it back so they could have more -- more oil. I don't get these guys.\nSecond thing I did, I went to the first company, and I got over 100 countries to agree to get rid of methane over a period of time. We're moving in a direction where we're going to -- I had a -- I had all the automobile companies down to the South Lawn of the White House. They all agreed to go totally by 2050, totally electric, totally electric.\nI convinced -- I brought labor together. Labor has been always opposed to environmental changes because they didn't cost them jobs. It's their future. They're going to build 550,000 electric charging stations all across America. My mom used to say, \"Out of everything bad, something good will come if you look hard enough for it.\" There's an enormous opportunity.\nWe're growing the economy. We're, in fact -- but then -- but there's not enough for us to do. We have to change the whole world's attitude. And right now, Russia and China are very, very difficult partners.\nForty percent of all the funding is going to go to those people. Look, I was raised in a town called Claymont, Delaware.\nWhen you got up in the morning, my mother would drive us to a little Catholic school we went to, about three quarters of a mile up the Philadelphia Pike. The first day of frost, she turned on the windshield wiper, there'd be an oil slick. Higher cancer rates in almost anywhere in America. I understand what these frontline communities are going through.\nRoute 9 in Delaware, the same thing. Look what's going on in Louisiana. So, we're focusing on those areas to get the help first, first, first. And 40 percent of it's going to go to them.\nYes, because the courts overrule me. The courts said I couldn't do it.\nI want to stop all drilling on the East Coast and the West Coast and in the Gulf. But I got -- I lost in court. But we're still pushing. We're still pushing really very hard. Look, the alternative is you get -- everything is better as we -- we have -- the private sector is coming off the sidelines. They've invested $250 billion in alternative energy.\nThey're building solar facilities. They're building -- you know, there's electrolyzers to take hydrogen and turn it -- I mean, there's so much going on. Finally, finally, no one can any longer deny that we don't have a problem with climate change.\nNo, no, no. Let's get it straight.\nThe United States was the top emitter, along with China, for a long time because we -- we -- emit more than any other country. And that was before the climate change, anything began. It's one of the reasons why we have a problem. And so, what we're doing is, notwithstanding -- not a single solitary person in the other party voted for my $368 billion climate change.\nNot one of them. They're all kind of taking credit now. I kind of find it interesting. But my point is that we're making significant progress. For example, every vehicle in America by 2050 is going to be electric vehicle. By 2030, 50 percent are electric vehicles, saving billions of gallons of not only not burning the oil, but also the environment is going to be saved.\nLook, the other thing we're doing, we have over 66,000 farms. We're now paying farmers to -- to plant crops that absorb carbon from the air.\nAnd we pay them to do it. And it's millions of acres. So, we are -- we're making significant progress, but it's a constant fight.\nThat's right.\nThree ways. Number one, the power grid is what people say, \"Not my neighborhood.\" These big high-tension wires that carry the electricity long distances. For example, we're now transmitting over those lines on the East Coast. We're transmitting solar -- I mean, wind power coming off the shores, OK? But the power grid, those -- the -- the electricity is going through these lines.\nWhen storms come and knock them down, the forest gets fires. There's three things we have to do. Number one, strengthen the power grid. When you build these things back up, build them much more sturdy than they are now. But secondly, spend the money to go underground. When you go underground, put them in pipes.\nIt costs more, but it's fundamentally safer. And the third thing is to make sure that while we're doing this, we are cleaning the floor of the -- of the forest. A lot of it -- if you ride up here, you'll see a lot of places. You'll see, you know, dead timber lying around. Well, lightning starts storms, too.\nSo you don't have as many fires. And we're beginning to make some progress in that. It's very expensive.\nWe're getting them tax credits to do it. That's what we'll do. You can afford to do it. And you can afford to weatherize your home. We're paying people to go out and make their homes more solid in the sense that they're not -- they're not letting out heat, they're not letting out cooling. And they have -- and -- and we're paying them to put on their roofs solar panels.\nIt's available to us. That's what the -- the so-called act, the $369 billion, that's part of what it's going for, and it's starting to catch on.\nSure.\nWell, we're preparing the military by trying to deal with the climate. So, for example, many of the bases that have flooded -- many of these massive floods, they've flooded out military bases in the Midwest and the South. That has a profound impact on readiness. And so, what we have to do is change the way in which we generate energy.\nAnd that's -- that's the whole of it. And the military is doing their part. Look, one of the things we have to do is be able to predict better. You're one of the best weather people in the country. Well, the federal government put up a lot of satellites up there, OK? It's very sophisticated to measure temperatures, to measure what's going on.\nAnd AI as well. You're much better positioned to predict what's going to happen tomorrow and the next day in terms of weather patterns.\nLook, I think the United States should do everything it can to help people who are in desperate need and have no other means of help. And we've always done that. It is not our -- it is just who we are. We're the United States of America. And the idea to begrudge the ability to do it -- for example, one of the things we're doing is we're providing for changing the environment, the -- the physical structures in the countries which they come from.\nSo, they don't have -- so they have better lighting, they have more secure -- for example, you have all -- so many lead pipes all across America and throughout the country. You have 440,000 schools. You turn on the water fountain, and you may have lead in the water. And -- and so -- and thousands of people -- we're replacing every single lead pipe in America.\nWe're loaning people money to do that, and we're -- I'm going to be meeting with the president of Brazil. For example, Brazil and the Amazon is more of a carbon sink, taking carbon out of the air --\nThan any place else in the world. It absorbs as much carbon in a day as -- as America emits in a day. So, it's overwhelming. I'm also -- we're also working together, and I've got the G7 nations agreeing that we're going to build infrastructure to provide for alternative energy sources in Africa and South America.\nAll of us -- because it's in the interest of Europe, it's the interest of the North, it's the interest of the United States to see that happen. So, there's a lot of things we're doing, a lot of it requires international engagement as well.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-stephanie-abrams-the-weather-channel-arizona"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan at Camp David, Maryland", "Date": "2023-08-18", "Text": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Camp David.\nIf I seem like I'm happy, it's because I am. [Laughter] This has been a great, great meeting.\nThere you go.\nWe needed the voice of God to tell us that. [Laughter]\nPresident.\nAamer [Aamer Madhani] of the AP.\n[Laughter] Well, first of all, look, there's not much, if anything, I agree on with my predecessor on foreign policy. His \"America first\" policy, walking away from the rest of the world, has made us weaker, not stronger.\nAmerica is strong with our allies and our alliances, and that's why we will endure. And it's a strength that—quite frankly, that increases all the—three of our strengths.\nThis is just about one summit. What makes today different is, it actually launches a series of initiatives that are actually institutional changes in how we deal with one another—in security cooperation, economic cooperation, technology cooperation, development cooperation, consultation exercises. And all of this will create now its own momentum, I believe, year by year, month by month, to make the relationship stronger and more certain to remain to be in place.\nAnd with regard—on these results, I think you're going to keep it going. And I think you're going to benefit all our countries.\nAnd with regard to the second question, I make—I have no comment on any investigation that's going on. That's up to the Justice Department, and that's all I have to say.\nI—look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.\nWe know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.\nAnd there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.\nAnd by the way, one of the things we get asked many times—and it wasn't directly asked, but implied—is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?\nThink about—as students of history, all of you; and you are—think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.\nAnd so I just think this is a—we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees.\nAnd you have a great imagination. One question ends up being six. But thank you. [Laughter] I'll try to answer all of it. [Laughter] I'm glad I didn't have you as my law professor when he said \"one question.\" [Laughter] At any rate, they're all legitimate questions.\nLook, on Ukraine, I and my country and the leadership of my country in both parties are very grateful for everything Japan is helping to deal with in Ukraine. And I mean that sincerely. You've showed strong leadership through the G-7 as well and contributed to a significant amount of financial and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as nonlethal military equipment.\nAnd you know—and they joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable through their international sanctions.\nIf my memory serves me well—and I think it does, Mr. Prime Minister—we found ourselves in a circumstance where, when I called you about Ukraine, I didn't have to convince you of anything. I started off to make the case that Ukraine was a circumstance where—to think, in the first quarter of the 20th century, another country would amass over 150,000 forces on the border of another country—or 150,000 forces and invade that country—invade that country without any rationale other than—if you read Putin's speech after he invaded, he talked about Kyiv being the motherland.\nYou know, I mean, it just was ridiculous, I think. And he talked about being Peter the Great. It was—just imagine if we had done nothing. Imagine if we had done nothing.\nAnd the point was immediately recognized, if I'm not mistaken, by you, Mr. Prime Minister, that we're in a situation where it could happen anywhere. If we stand—if we had stood still, what signal would that send to China about Taiwan? What signal would that send around the world if nations weren't powerful on borders?\nBut here's the deal. You contributed significantly to what, I think, is already the—let me put it this way. Russia has already lost. It cannot meet its original objective which it stated. It's not possible.\nBut—and they've joined so many other nations in holding Russia accountable for international sanctions. But Japan's leadership, from day one, that has been critical for making it clear that the consequences for war extend well beyond Europe—well beyond Europe.\nI say it in reverse. What would happen if an Asian country with 150,000 troops invaded another? You think that would not affect the interests, the economy, and the foreign policy of nations in Europe and Latin America all across the world? It would have profound impact.\nAnd with Japan's leadership, from day one, it has been critical to making clear the consequences of this will extend well beyond Europe—well beyond Europe. It's a global issue that has impacts everywhere. And the Prime Minister's comments at Shangri-La capture that.\nAnd by the way, you know, we talked about this being an inflection point. The world is changing. The world is changing. And about every six or seven generations, it makes significant change. And there's a lot happening.\nAnd the idea that we're going to sit down, the rest of the world, and say, \"Well, that's only a European problem.\" There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War II.\nAnd so—as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all. And my team has been working very closely with the—President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\" But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly—constantly.\nAnd your other two questions about China—I'll just say this: This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting. But it did come—China obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised.\nIt was about more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a region, quite frankly, that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact.\nThink about what's going—at any rate, I won't get going. I'll take too long. [Laughter]\nBut as you've seen from the initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we've put together and I think we're going to—you're going to see it expand. It's not merely what we did today. This is a historic meeting.\nBut we're about to—we've laid in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia, but around the world.\nSomeone once said in a different context that—about a health care provision in my country a while ago: This is a big deal. [Laughter] This is a big deal.\nThank you.\nThey have to answer their questions.\nTo answer your question, I expect and hope to follow up on our conversation on Bali this fall. That's my expectation. Thank you.\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre.This concludes our press conference. Please—please stay seated as the leaders depart, please. Please stay seated.\nWe're winning all the competition.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-and-prime-minister"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Hanoi, Vietnam", "Date": "2023-09-10", "Text": "Good evening, everyone. It is evening, isn't it? [Laughter] This around-the-world in 5 days is interesting, isn't it?\nWell, you know, there is that—one of my staff members said, \"Remember the famous song, you know, 'Good Morning, Vietnam'?\" Well, good evening, Vietnam. And good morning back in America.\nBefore we begin, I want to express my sadness by the loss of life and devastation caused by the earthquake in Morocco. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Morocco and my friend King Mohammed VII—VI, I should say.\nAnd his administration—my administration—including Secretary of State Blinken, who is here with me today—is working with Moroccan officials on long distance here. We're working expeditiously to ensure American citizens in Morocco are safe, standing ready to provide any necessary assistance to the Moroccan people as well. We've made that offer.\nNow, turning to the important visit here in Vietnam. As the General Secretary and I just shared earlier today, this trip has been a historic moment. Today, we can trace 50 years—a 50-year arc of progress in the relationship between our nations from conflict to normalization. This is a new elevated status that will be a force for prosperity and security in one of the most consequential regions in the world. We've elevated our cooperation directly to the Vietnamese's highest tier of partnership, referred to as the comprehensive strategic partnership. That means the United States has strengthened our ties with another critical Indo-Pacific partner.\nOur progress today builds on the Camp David trilateral with Japan and the Republic of Korea and the United States; the comprehensive strategic partnership the United States launched with ASEAN last year; and the engagement with Pacific Islands—with the Pacific Islands Forum; our strengthened alliances with the Philippines; and AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom; our elevated Quad engagement with India, Australia, and Japan; and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity; and all the effort we've advanced from day one of my administration to demonstrate to our Indo-Pacific partners and to the world the United States is a Pacific nation, and we're not going anywhere.\nNow, let me also speak to a significant business we got done in the—in India during the G-20 summit. This was an important moment for the United States to demonstrate our global leadership and our commitment to solving the challenges that matter most to people around the world: investing in inclusive growth and sustainable development, addressing the climate crisis, strengthening food security and education, advancing global health and health security.\nWe showed up ready to work, and we showed the world the United States is a partner with a positive vision for our shared future. As a G-20, we—at the G-20, we made progress on issues like multilateral development bank reform to get to those nations that are neither poor nor wealthy, but were—couldn't qualify before; debt relief; and increased infrastructure needs not only in the Global South, but other parts of the world as well.\nWe forged a groundbreaking new partnership with—that will connect India to Europe with the Middle East and Israel, with transportation by rail and by shipment through—and energy supplies and digital connections that are going to open up untold opportunities for transformative economic investment through that—on that entire corridor.\nWe've also discussed Russia's brutal and illegal war in Ukraine. And there was sufficient agreement in the room on the need for just—for a just and lasting peace that upholds the principles of the U.N. Charter and respects sovereignty and territorial integrity.\nI want to, once again, thank Prime Minister Modi for his leadership and his hospitality in hosting the G-20. He and I have had substantial discussions about how we're going to continue to strengthen the partnership between India and the United States, building on the Prime Minister's visit to the White House last June.\nAnd, as I always do, I raised the important—of respecting human rights and the vital role that civil society and a free press have in building a strong and prosperous country with Mr. Modi.\nAnd we're—have gotten a lot of important work done, and I'm looking forward to another good day tomorrow here in Vietnam.\nAnd now, I will take your questions. Let me see. They told me—they gave me five people here.\nNandita of Reuters [Nadita Bose, Reuters].\nChina-U.S. Relations/Indo-Pacific Diplomatic Efforts/Quadrilateral Security Dialogue\nOh, there you are. I couldn't——\n——see you. I'm sorry.\nI'm sorry, the what?\nThe sincerity of the Biden administration.\nWell, look, first of all, the—I am sincere about getting the relationship right. And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.\nAnd so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chinese—no one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.\nAnd so, really, what this trip was about—it was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.\nAnd I think that one of the things we've done—I've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 months—is, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.\nThat's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.\nAnd it's—for example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doing—why was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, \"To maintain stability.\" It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the road—everything from airspace and space in the ocean is—the international rules of the road are abided by.\nAnd so—and I hope that—I think that Prime Minister Xi—I mean, Xi has some—some difficulties right now. All countries end up with difficulties, and he had some economic difficulties he's working his way through. I want to see China succeed economically, but I want to see them succeed by the rules.\nThe next question was to Bloomberg.\nChina/Taiwan/U.S. Export Controls\nSay the first part of your question again. Because there—this fan is going on, and it's loud here behind me.\nLook, I think China has a difficult economic problem right now for a whole range of reasons that relate to the international growth and lack thereof and the policies that China has followed.\nAnd so I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite: It probably doesn't have the same capacity that it had before.\nBut as I said, I'm not—we're not looking to hurt China, sincerely. We're all better off if China does well, if China does well by the international rules. It grows the economy.\nBut they have had some real difficulty in terms of their economy of late, particularly in real estate. Aside—that end of their bargain. And I think the actions that they're going to have to take are ones that are—they're in the process of deciding right now. And I'm not going to predict what way it will come out. But we're not looking to decouple from China.\nWhat I'm not going to do is, I'm not going to sell China material that would enhance their capacity to make more nuclear weapons, to engage in defense activities that are contrary to what is viewed as most people would think was a positive development in the region.\nAnd—but we're not trying to hurt China.\nGood evening.\nWell. Thank you.\nThese 5-day trips around the world are no problem.\nWell, I hope I get to see Mr. Xi sooner than later. I've spent more time with him than any other world leader has, sum total, over the last 12 years. So I hope we get to see him again soon.\nBut no, look—for example, one of the things we did in India: We provided for a new path that's going to save everybody money, increase the Third World—\"the Third World\"—the Global South's capacity to grow by sending—we're going to—from—we're going to have a new railroad from India all the way across to the Mediterranean, new shipping lanes and pipelines across the Mediterranean through Europe, up into Great Britain and beyond.\nThat's all about economic growth. That has nothing to do with hurting China or helping China. It has to do with dealing with everything from climate change to making sure that these countries can succeed economically and grow.\nLook, my thesis has been, from the beginning, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy: Invest in your people. Invest in the people. Give them a chance.\nEverything is better off when people—I know it's going to sound trite. If everybody in the world had a job they get up in the morning and wanted to go to and thought they—and they could put three squares in the table for their family, no matter where they live, the whole world be better off. We'd be a lot better. That's the notion here behind this.\nFor example, you know, one of the things we're doing in terms of—I proposed a long time ago at the G-7, now it's—that's going to come to fruition at the G-20, is making sure that we build a railroad all the way across the African Continent. Think about it. There is no way to cross the African Continent by road—by rail. And there's not even a direct highway across.\nNow, let's assume for the sake of discussion—when we talk about food shortages—assume there was one country in that vast continent that had a—an excess of foodstuffs and resources. How would they get it to where they're going to go? How are they going to do it?\nThat's why we're also going to invest billions of dollars in solar facilities in Angola to have the largest—the largest solar facility in the world—among the largest. That helps Angola, but it also helps the whole region.\nSo I think we think too much in terms of cold war terms. It's not about that. It's about generating economic growth and stability in all parts of the world. And that's what we're trying to do.\nThank you.\nIt wasn't so much an agreement that we would try to meet the goals at the G-20. The United States is going to meet those goals, by the way. We're going to exceed those goals. A lot of other countries are as well.\nBut we want to give those countries that don't have the economic wherewithal and did not cause the problem in the first place—for example, I met with Lula in Brazil.\nI started off way back in the eighties with a really fine Republican Senator named Dick Lugar. We said: \"Here's what we're going to do. If you owe us money, we're going to forgive your debt if you maintain your forest.\" Because they become carbon sinks. They're the things that take carbon out of the air.\nAnd so we're talking to what we should be go—and the countries that cleared their land and put cattle on there and farming and did all the things that—and increased development, they, in fact, are the ones—the reasons why—the main reason why we've gotten as far down the road to disaster here as we have.\nAnd so it seems—and if we have the economic capacity, we—those nations should be getting together and providing help for the nations that don't have the wherewithal to do it, the economic wherewithal and the infrastructure wherewithal.\nAnd that's why, for example, I mentioned—in the interest of time, I'll just mention Angola again. Angola has the capacity to generate megawatts of energy through solar energy. They don't have the economic means to do that. Isn't it in the interest of the whole world if they are, in fact, able to generate significant capacity to absorb—to prevent carbon from being released in the air? I think that it is.\nSo what we're trying to do is help those nations. The—and particularly in the Global South, where they're not as wealthy, where there are not as many opportunities to be able to deal with the things that they want to deal with.\nFor example—and I'll end with this—there is more carbon absorbed from the atmosphere on a daily basis—and I'll look to my—my friend, John Kerry, who'd forgotten more about this than most people know—correct me if I get this wrong, John, but I'm quite sure I'm right—and that is that there's more carbon observed [absorbed; White House correction] from the air into the Amazon region into the ground—the ground—than emitted in the entire United States on the same basis.\nNow, imagine if people go in and do what we did 150, 200, 250 years ago and cut down the forest and the—start farming in that area, no longer have that great carbon sink. We—you know, it's going—it would be a gigantic problem.\nSo we should be going to areas, whether it's in the Congo or other places, as the G-7 nations and as the wealthy G-20 nations, the—and providing the kind of infrastructure they need to be able to benefit.\nAnd guess what? In addition to helping the environment overall—and the only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 20—10 years. We're—that'd be real trouble. There's no way back from that.\nAnd so there's a lot we can do in the meantime. For example, that pipeline—that railroad we're talking about going across from the middle—from India, throughout the Middle East, and to—across the Mediterranean and all through Europe, that's going to have a hydrogen pipeline there. This is going to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted in the air, but it costs a lot of money to put that down. And the world is going to say it's in our interest—collective interest to do it.\nSo I have not—I have not given up at all on the notion that we're going to be able to, you know—how can I say it? I think we can triple the renewable capacity for—as it relates to global warming—by the year 2030—2030.\nCountries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passed—the clean energy jobs, they're going to create manufacturing jobs.\nFor example, as a consequence of what we've done, we have the most—we have the most—we have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the world—in the world. Now, we've got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world.\nAnd one of the reasons we're doing it—we changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economy—that is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well.\nWell, the truth of the matter is, I've never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with me—just flat, straight-out academic economists—and that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up.\nWhen that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well. But you're going to start paying your taxes if I have anything to do it. That's a different issue.\nBut all kidding aside—so there's—we have—I think the other thing that's dawning on people—many of you who are foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time. Did you ever think you'd be sitting at a G-20 conference where everyone was preoccupied with the notion of global warming? Not a joke. Did you ever think that?\nAnd there's a—my brother loves having—there's famous lines from movies that he always quotes. You know, it's—and one of them is—there's a movie about John Wayne. He's an Indian scout. And they're trying to get the—I think it was the Apache—one of the great tribes of America back on the reservation.\nAnd he's standing with a Union soldier—so he's—they're all on their—and they're on their horses in their saddles. And there's three or four Indians in headdresses, and the Union soldiers—and the Union soldiers are basically saying to the Indians: \"Come with me, we'll take care of you. We'll—everything will be good.\" And the Indian scout—the Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, \"He's a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.\"\nWell, there's a lot of lying, dog-faced pony soldiers out there about global warming, but not anymore. All of a sudden, they're all realizing it's a problem. And there's nothing like seeing the light.\nFor—and let's see. I'm just following my orders here.\nStaff, is there anybody I haven't spoken to?\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nNo, I ain't calling on you. I'm calling on—I said there were five questions.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.Anita—Anita from VOA.\nAnita [Anita Powell, Voice of America] from VOA.\nRussia/China-U.S. Relations\nOh, I know better than that.\nIf you send me a softball, I wouldn't know what to do with it. I'd probably strike out even worse.\nIt's not a wedge issue of the Global South. It's a wedge issue with Russia, which was present, and with China, which was present—which was—had the representation.\nAnd so—and by the way, I am a—my team, my staff still meets with President Xi's people and his Cabinet, in effect; I met with his number-two person here in—excuse me, in India today.\nSo it's not like there's a crisis if I don't personally speak to him. It would be better if I did, but I think—look, this is not a criticism; it's an observation: He has his hands full right now. He has overwhelming unemployment with his youth. One of the major economic tenets of his plan isn't working at all right now. I'm not happy for that. But it's not working.\nSo he's trying to figure out, I suspect—I don't know—just like I would, trying to figure out what to do about the particular crisis they're having now.\nBut I don't think it's a crisis relating to conflict between China and the United States. As a matter of fact, I think it's less likely to cause that kind of conflict. I don't—anyway, I just think that there are other things on leaders' minds, and they respond to what's needed at the time.\nAnd look, nobody likes having celebrated international meetings if you don't know what you want at the meeting, if you don't have a game plan. He may have a game plan; he just hasn't shared it with me.\nBut I tell you what, I don't know about you, but I'm going to go to bed.\nWe talked about what we talked about at the conference overall. We talked about stability. We talked about making sure that the Third World—the—excuse me—\"Third World\"—the Southern Hemisphere had access to change, it had access—we—it wasn't confrontational at all. He came up to me. He said—[inaudible].\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre.Thank—thank you, everybody.\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre.This ends the press conference. Thanks, everyone.\nThank you. Thank you.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\n[Inaudible]—above human rights, and I've raised it with every person I met with.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-hanoi-vietnam-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with John Harwood of ProPublica", "Date": "2023-09-29", "Text": "Happy to do it.\nWell, you know, I'm optimistic, and I thought we could do that well. And you remember, in 2022, I thought we were going to do well, too.\nI think the means in which people are tracking polls now, they've kind of lost their focus and it's hard to get it done. Secondly, I think that -- I think, you know, the media has changed a lot.\nWell, I think the opposite things happen. I think that this is sort of the last gasp or maybe the first big gasp of the MAGA Republicans. And I think Trump has concluded that he has to win and he'll pull out all the stops. I mean, the quotes he uses are just -- I never thought I'd hear a president say some of the stuff he says.\nAnd so, I think that -- and you see what's happening in terms of what the MAGA Republicans are doing in the House.\nThey don't make up a majority of the House, but they're bringing everything to a screeching halt.\nWe should never condone violence in a democracy, but I think it's well beyond that. For example, the idea -- when I talk about democracy, democracy is sort of the -- what surrounds the -- the -- the underpinning of democracy, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, all those things that provide for the certainty that everybody gets a shot.\nAnd so, you know, we the people, I know it sounds corny, but that's what we're talking about.\nAnd everything that's happening now is designed to prevent that from happening, for the people's voice. For example, he wants to change the way the civil service works for --\nAnd he wants a whole new category that is not answerable -- not answerable to the civil service rules but only answer to -- answerable to the president, those kinds of things.\nIt's more -- it's more politics. Look, when I got elected, remember, everybody told me that we would never get anything bipartisan, not going to get it done.\nWell, we surprised some people. With one vote majority, we were able to get a number of things passed, and -- and about half of it was bipartisan.\nSo, I don't think it was a consequence of -- of -- of the parties. It was a consequence of things I'm worried about are the institutional changes --\nThat are attempted to be made.\nI know.\nI think it says two things. The speaker's made a terrible bargain. In order to keep the speakership, he's willing to do things that he -- I think he knows are inconsistent with constitutional processes, number one. Number two, I think it says that there is a group of MAGA Republicans who genuinely want to have a fundamental change in the way the -- the system works.\nAnd that's what worries me the most, is the change in what constitutes, for example, the idea that we'd be in a position where they're willing to say that it's OK for the president to talk about -- he said, \"I am your retribution. I am --\"\nI mean, these -- all these weird things that are being said, and they seem to be encouraging it.\nI agree.\nI'm really worried if that's the case, and that's why I think that I want to change -- increase the focus on the fundamentals here, that democracy, literally, our democracy is at stake. And -- and it's by altering the institutional structures to protect it. And -- and I think that -- I think we're in real trouble if that's not the case.\nBut I'm convinced that part of it is communicating to the American people this is bigger than political disagreement.\nIt's beyond that. And when you -- when you talk to people like, for example, the speech I recently made on democracy, I made about four major speeches on democracy. Initially, with notable exceptions, people thought, \"What's Biden talking about here?\" Well, you know, that has showed that over 60% of the American people, they were worried, too.\nAnd that's one of the reasons why 2020 turned out the way it did, 2022 turned out the way it did. And so, I think it's important that -- to give people some hope that we can get through this. Look, we're on the cusp of being able to do not because of me, not because of my presidency, but because of being able to do some really big things in America.\nI worry because I know that if the other team, the MAGA Republicans, win, they don't want to uphold the rule of law. They want to get rid of the FBI. I mean, the thing -- the things they say, and -- and I think that, somehow, we got to communicate to the American people, this is for real.\nThis is real if they were to take over, if they were to have their way. And -- but I do think, at the end of the day, this court, which has been one of the most extreme courts, I still think, in the basic fundamentals of the rule of law, that they would sustain the rule of law.\nIt's a tough call whether we can. I think we can, but let's skip over that. What does the Constitution call and expect of the court, of the court? And I -- the idea that the Constitution would, in any way, prohibit or not encourage the court to be -- have basic rules of ethics that are just on their face reasonable.\nDo it themselves is just not -- not the case.\nThat's a -- you get a lot of serious constitutional scholars disagreeing on -- on either side of that. As you can understand, I'm not going to opine on that right now.\nI don't think it was phrased that way. But I think if you say -- if it's phrased if the president -- if the former president were to become president again, the things he says he will do are a threat to American democracy. And by the way, it's not just here.\nAs I travel the world, I have a head of state asking me -- I mean, conservative state, \"Look, what's going to happen? Does that mean --\" because democracy is in jeopardy in other parts of the world as well. And, you know, Madeleine Albright was right, we are the essential nation. If it fails here, Katy, bar the door.\nI'm not the only Democrat that can protect it; I just happen to be the Democrat who, I think, is best positioned to see to it that the guy I was worried about taking on democracy is not president.\nLook, if you take a look at all what I propose, they're overwhelmingly popular with the American people. Not -- nothing I've proposed is extreme. For example, you know, dealing with investing in America and increasing manufacturing, creating jobs, being in a position where we put more money into education, where we just make everybody pay their fair share, those things, as measured, broadly, they're -- they're popular across the board.\nSo, the thing that -- that I have trouble trying to figure out is what it is that -- other than protecting the Constitution, what is it that these MAGA Republicans think is extreme about what I'm doing?\nThey haven't been -- I mean, I haven't heard or seen any articulation of any of that.\nYeah.\nWell, he has a democratic right to do it. There's no reason not to do that. Now, it's going to help the other guy, and he knows. So, that doesn't -- that -- that's a political decision he's making that I obviously think is a mistake, but he has a right to do that.\nWhen I left the Senate, I was able to convince Strom Thurmond to vote for the Voting Rights Act. Strom Thurmond. And I thought, you know, you can -- you can defeat hate --\nYou can bury it, you can kill it, but I learned you can't. All you can do is you can drive it underground.\nAnd when you breathe oxygen under the rock, it comes roaring back out again. And I think one of the things that I see -- you may recall, in the 2020 campaign, I said, \"I speak to you not from Wall Street; I speak to you from Scranton, Pennsylvania.\" That was a bit of a populist point, but it was a genuine point that, in fact, I represent all those people, I will represent all those people.\nBut there is a real play. The world is changing, John, and we're going to be -- the fact is we're going to be, very shortly, a minority-white European country.\nAnd sometimes, my colleagues don't speak enough to make it clear that that -- that's not going to change how we operate. That's not going to change them.\nIt's not so much the economic benefits; it's treating them with respect, treating them with respect. You may remember, because you're barely old enough, but you may remember back in '72, we ran a campaign that Nixon won overwhelmingly in '72. He won over 60% of the vote in my state, and I won by 3,100 votes.\nThe issue then was that we were limousine liberals. We weren't paying attention to the problems of ordinary families and speaking to their immediate needs. Well, I've never not done that. And I think the Democratic Party in the past has, on occasion, spoken less to the needs and fears and concerns. And so, I think, you know, a lot of the guys I grew up with in Claymont, Delaware and Scranton, Pennsylvania, they feel like they're not being respected, not so much by policy, just by the -- by the failure to talk about their needs.\nAnd that's why, John, I think -- I think the reason why I was able to get the -- my economic programs passed is because I talked about -- I'm talking about building a country from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, and that includes everybody, And embracing, embracing the blue-collar workers.\nNot legitimize it, not talk about it like it's appropriate, not talk about it. There's never, never, never, never a rationale for political violence in America. That's not who we are. And speak to it, speak up. It matters. It matters.\nThey do both. Look, there are no editors anymore. That's one of the big problems. There's nobody telling -- and I gave my word I never would reveal who, but I've spoken to at least half a dozen serious reporters over the last six, eight years who say to me, \"I'm worried if I do not say and do something that gets me -- raises the issue up, I'm not going to get a hit. And if I don't get a hit on television, I don't -- I don't -- my pay, my --\"\nI mean, the whole dynamic has changed. I'm no expert in the press, but it's changed.\nYeah, it does. Look, one of the things, as I said to you, when I thought I wasn't going to run, I was going to write a book about the changes taking place. And most of it's directed, over the years, these fundamental changes in society by changing technology. Gutenberg printing and the printing press changed the way Europeans could talk to one, another all the way to today.\nWhere -- where do people get their news? They -- they -- they -- you know, they go on the internet. They -- they go online. They go -- and you have no notion whether it's true or not.\nVote. Vote. Look, I was saying to my staff, I never thought I'd see a time when someone was worried about being on a jury because there may be physical violence against them if they voted the wrong way. I never thought -- I never thought that would happen. Like maybe a mobster's case, right?\nI mean, think about that.\nWell, they are. And I think if you don't want to engage, you just act. You just do what you think is right, and part of that is just showing up, showing up. But I also think that we should be engaging people more and -- and not -- not be worried about our neighbor. Talk to them, sit down, and say, \"What do you think?\" Well -- and not get in arguments but say this is what -- you say this, but how about this, and force people to get in a two-way conversation.\nBut it's hard, John. But the biggest thing is, look, I really do believe that the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, straightforward. I mean, I think it's a minority minority. And I think they have to, though, understand, one, what the danger is if they don't participate, and two, show up, show up, show up.\nThanks for having me. Quite frankly, I'd like to do more of it with you, and I mean it sincerely.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-john-harwood-propublica"}
{"Title": "Interview with Scott Pelley of CBS News \"60 Minutes\"", "Date": "2023-10-15", "Text": "I'm saying we're gonna do everything in our power to find those who are still alive and set them free. Everything in our power. And-- I'm not gonna go into the detail of that, but there's-- we're workin' like hell on it.\nBecause I think they have to know that the president of the United States of America cares deeply about what's happening. Deeply. We have to communicate to the world this is critical. this is not even hum-- human behavior. It's-- it-- it-- it's-- it's-- it's pure barbarism. And we're gonna do everything in our power to get them home if we can find them.\nOf course, it is. But it's hard to-- hard to make distinctions. It's-- most important thing is ending this brutality and to hold those who committed it accountable.\nI-- I don't think that's necessary. Israel has one of the finest fighting forces in the country. I guarantee we're gonna provide them everything they need.\nYes. I had a meeting this morning with the Homeland Security people, with the FBI, with-- for the Situation Room, for the better part of an hour to discuss how we make sure that we prevent a lone wolf and/or any cohi-- coordinated effort to try to do what was done in synagogues before, do what was done to Jews in the street. we're making a major effort to make sure that doesn't happen.\nLook, there's a fundamental difference. Israel is going after a group of people who have engaged in barbarism that is as consequential as the Holocaust. And-- so I think Israel has to respond. They have to go after Hamas. Hamas is a bunch of cowards. They're hiding behind the civilians. They put their of—their—their—their headquarters where civilians are and buildings and the like. But to the extent they can separate out and avoi—I'm conf-- the Israelis are gonna do everything in their power to avoid the killing of innocent civilians.\nHamas is an Islamist terrorist group and the government of Gaza. Gaza is 25 miles long and averages 5 miles wide. Israel severely limits its economy so most Gazans are destitute. Now, Israel has cut off food, fuel, electricity and most water, and has ordered 1 million Gazans to evacuate to the southern half of Gaza. The U.N. warns of a humanitarian disaster.\nYes, our team is talkin' to 'em about that. And-- whether there could be a safe zone. We're also talking to Egyptians-- whether there is an outlet to get these children and-- and women out--- into---out of that a that area at this moment. But it's-- it's c-- hard.\nYes.\nYes.\nI'm confident that Israel is going to act under the measure-- the-- the rules of war. There-- there's-- standards that democratic institutions and countries w-- go-- go by. And so-- I'm-- I-- I'm confident that there's gonna be an ability for the innocents in Gaza to be able to have access to medicine and food and water.\nI think it'd be a big mistake. Look, what happened in Gaza, in my view, is Hamas and the extreme elements of Hamas don't represent all the Palestinian people. And I think that...It would be a mistake to...for Israel to occupy...Gaza again. We...but going in but taking out the extremists the Hezbollah is up north but Hamas down south. Is a necessary requirement.\nYes, I do. But there needs to be a Palestinian authority. There needs to be a path to a Palestinian state.\nThat path, called \"the two state solution,\" has been U.S. policy for decades. It would create an independent nation next to Israel for 5 million Palestinians who live in Gaza and on the West Bank of the Jordan River.\nNot now. Not now. Not now, but-- but I think Israel understands that a significant portion of Palestinian people do not share the views of Hamas and Hezbollah.\nHezbollah is a powerful Islamist militia to Israel's north which is armed and trained by Iran. Iran also supports Hamas.\nDon't. Don't, don't, don't.\nThat's right.\nI don't wanna get into classified information. But to be very blunt with you, there is no clear evidence of that.\nCorrect. Now, Iran constantly supports Hamas and Hezbollah. I don't mean that. But in terms of were they-- w-- did they have foreknowledge; did they help plan the attack-- the-- there's-- there's no evidence of that at this point.\nThe president is asking for billions of dollars for Israel and Ukraine. But Congress is paralyzed. Hard-right Republicans are obstructing the election of a speaker of the house.\nYes. Look, this is not your father's Republican Party. Thirty percent of it's made up of these MAGA Republicans who are maybe-- democracy is something I don't-- they don't look at the same way you and I look at democracy.\nNo. We're the United States of America for God's sake, the most powerful nation in the history-- not in the world, in the history of the world. The history of the world. We can take care of both of these and still maintain our overall international defense.\nRussia's unprovoked invasion occupies nearly 20% of Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands have been killed or wounded. In an interview last month, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told us he could lose without U.S. aid.\nOverwhelmingly, they relate. For example, in Ukraine one of my objectives was to prevent Putin, who has committed war crimes himself, who-- from bein' able to occupy an independent country that borders NATO allies and is on the Russian border. Imagine what happens now if he were able to succeed. Have you ever known a major war in Europe we didn't get sucked into? We don't want that to happen. We want to make sure those democracies are sustained. And Ukraine is critical in making sure that happens.\nI want my children and grandchildren to fully understand exactly what happened and why you couldn't deny the carnage going on if you were living in Germany and in Europe.\nThe Jews have been subject to abuse, prejudice, and-- and-- attempt to wipe them out for, oh, God, over a th-- thousand years. For me, it's about decency, respect, honor. it's just simply wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It violates every religious principle I have and every way-- and every single principle my father taught me.\nAs we spoke to the president, his secretary of state was in Israel, his secretary of defense was in a NATO meeting on Ukraine. America's oldest president seemed tired from directing all of this. But he was very clear on what he stood for and how his policies, in his view, would see America through.\nYes ..because.. I'm sure. Look, when I ran, I said, \"The world's at an inflection point.\" The world's changing, but we have an opportunity to make it-- so, imagine if we were able to succeed in getting the Middle East put in place where we have normalization of relations. I think we can do that. Imagine what happens if we, in fact, unite all of Europe and Putin is finally put down where he cannot cause the kind of trouble he's been causing. We have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make it a better world.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-scott-pelley-cbs-news-60-minutes-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia", "Date": "2023-10-25", "Text": "The sun is over there.\n[At this point, President Biden removed his sunglasses.]\nI don't need these. [Laughter]\nHello, folks.\nAll right. We're going to take a few questions now.\nAbout one or two more, huh?\nJoey, look, we have had troops in the region since 9/11 to go after ISIS and prevent its reassert—reemergence in both—well, anyway, in the region, having nothing to do with Israel at all.\nMy warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we will respond, and he should be prepared. It has nothing to do with Israel.\nNo. What I have indicated to him is that if that's possible to get these folks out safely, that's what he should do. It's their decision, but I did not demand it. I pointed out to him: If it's real, it should be done.\nThank you.\nYou want to make a speech? [Laughter] No, look——\n——obviously, they're in jeopardy. The question is whether or not there's any way of getting them out. If we can get them out, we should get them out.\nGo get 'em, Joe Joe. [Laughter]\nDo you know anyone in elective office who can give a personal guarantee that it happens? I won't—I'm not going to——\nNo, I'm going to try, and I believe it will get done.\nLook, last week, we requested $3.4 billion in supplemental funds to boost submarine production and maintenance to meet U.S. needs and also support AUKUS. Australia is making a significant—a significant—investment in the United States and its ability to produce submarines as part of this deal. And more importantly, it's important that Congress move quickly.\nAnd the fact is that I'm confident that we can get this done, because—you remember when we put it—the deal together? The response—the Democrats and Republicans in the United States—the response around the free world was: \"This is a very, very good thing. A very good thing.\"\nSo the question is not if, but when, and I—and Joe Joe told us that they—we've got a new Speaker or will likely have a new Speaker. I hope that's true because we have to get moving. We have to get moving. And so I'm—I am confident that we're going to be able to get the money for AUKUS because it's overwhelmingly in our interest.\nWhen I was asked—when we put together the deal, I was asked by Xi Jinping, were we just trying to surround China? I said, \"No, we're not surrounding China.\" We're just making sure that the sea lanes remain open, he doesn't unilaterally be able to change the out—the rules of the road in terms of what constitutes international airspace and water space, et cetera. And so that's what this is all about. It's about making sure we have a close—and it's in addition to the fact that we put together the Quad, which they didn't like. The Quad is a very important piece as well.\nIt's about maintaining stability: stability in the Taiwan Strait, the Indian Ocean, the whole—that whole area. And I think it's going to increase the prospects for long-term peace rather than do anything else.\nOh, I get to ask. I'm going to get to—okay.\nNo.\nBecause he can't have—look, just like I was not worried that the last guy would be able to overturn the election. They have about 60 lawsuits, and they—all the way to the Supreme Court, and, every time, they lost. I understand the Constitution.\nWhat they say to me is I have no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. I'm sure innocents have been killed, and it's the price of waging a war.\nI think we should be incredibly careful. I think—well, not \"we\"—the Israelis should be incredibly careful to be sure that they're focusing on going after the folks that are the propagating this war against Israel. And it's against their interest when that doesn't happen.\nBut I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using.\nThe context of extreme competition was not conflict. Read the whole paragraph. I talked about—we're going to have—we're going to compete with China on every way according to the international rules—economically, politically, and other ways—but not—I'm not looking for conflict.\n\"Trust but verify\" is the phrase. And look, China is having their own internal and external difficulties right now. China's economic growth is stagnant compared to what it was. China has engaged in activities that Russia and many other activities that—that others have engaged in, in terms of intimidation and dealing with other countries.\nBut the fact is that I have met with Xi Jinping more than any other world leader has. I've had over 68 hours of private meetings, just he and I with simultaneous interpreters—starting back when I was Vice President, because it wasn't appropriate for a President of the United States to be meeting with the Vice President. So I traveled 17,000 miles with him.\nAnd I've subsequently—in addition to that 68 hours, I've also had another—they tell me—they keep meticulous contact as I—another, I think, 12, 15 hours of discussions, just he and I.\nAnd I think that he is realizing that there are—for example, his Belt and Road Initiative—well, we're going to compete on that. And we're going to—we're doing it a different way. The Belt and Road Initiative has been a debt and a noose for most of the people that signed on. We are working with our G-7 partners to provide infrastructure for the very nations that he's trying to deal with.\nWe want to—for example, the G—at the G-20, we were able to act on a proposal I had to bring—to build a railroad all the way from Riyadh, all the way through the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Israel, up through Greece, and then across the—not the railroad, but pipeline across the Mediterranean up into Europe. To——\nPardon me?\nWell, I hope the United—not just me—I hope the United States is a reliable partner when we act. But it wasn't just the United States that agreed on that.\nBecause, look, even to this day, when my discussions with the Saudis, the Crown Prince, was he wants to see a reconciliation take place. It's overwhelmingly in his interest. It's in Saudis' interest. It's—the idea that you'd have the nations of the Middle East cooperating economically and politically changes the dynamic significantly.\nAnd so I just think that it is—it's something that it's in everyone's interest, including, long-term, in China's interest.\nLouder! Holler louder!", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-australia"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Woodside, California", "Date": "2023-11-15", "Text": "I didn't know there were this many people in town. Please have a seat. As you know, I just concluded several hours of meetings with President Xi, and I believe they were some of the most constructive and productive discussions we've had.\nI've been meeting with President Xi since both of us were Vice President over 10 years ago. Our meetings have always been candid and straightforward. We haven't always agreed, but they've been straightforward. And today, built on the groundwork we laid over the past several months of high-level diplomacy between our teams, we've made some important progress, I believe.\nFirst, I'm pleased to announce that after many years of being on hold, we are restarting cooperation between the United States and the P.R.C. on counternarcotics.\nIn 2019, you may remember, China took action to greatly reduce the amount of fentanyl shipped directly from China to the United States. But in the years since that time, the challenge has evolved from finished fentanyl to fentanyl chemical ingredients and pill presses, which are being shipped without controls. And by the way, some of these pills are being inserted in other drugs, like cocaine, and a lot of people are dying.\nMore people in the United States between the ages of 18 to 49 die from fentanyl than from guns, car accidents, or any other cause. Period.\nSo today, with this new understanding, we're taking action to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals and pill presses from China to the Western Hemisphere. It's going to save lives, and I appreciate President Xi's commitment on this issue. President Xi and I tasked our teams to maintain a policy and law enforcement coordination going forward to make sure it works.\nI also want to thank the bipartisan congressional delegation to China, led by Leader Schumer, in October for supporting efforts—this effort so strongly.\nSecondly, and this is critically important, we're reassuming military-to-military contacts—direct contacts. As a lot of you press know who follow this, that's been cut off, and it's been worrisome. That's how accidents happen: misunderstandings. So we're back to direct, open, clear, direct communications on a direct basis.\nVital miscalculations on either side can—are—can cause real, real trouble with a country like China or any other major country. And so I think we made real progress there as well.\nAnd thirdly, we're going to get our experts together to discuss risk and safety issues associated with artificial intelligence. As many of you who travel with me around the world almost everywhere I go—every major leader wants to talk about the impact of artificial intelligence.\nThese are tangible steps in the right direction to determine what's useful and what's not useful, what's dangerous and what's acceptable.\nMoreover, there are evidence of cases that I've made all along: The United States will continue to compete vigorously with the P.R.C. But we'll manage that competition responsibly so it doesn't veer into conflict or accidental conflict. And where it's possible, where our interests are—coincide, we're going to work together, like we did on fentanyl.\nThat's what the world expects of us—the rest of the world expects, not just in—people in China and the United States, but the rest of the world expects that of us. And that's what the United States is going to be doing.\nToday President Xi and I also exchanged views on a range of regional and global issues, including Russia's refusal and brutal war—to stop the war—and brutal war of aggression against Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza.\nAnd as I always do, I raised areas where the United States has concerns about the P.R.C.'s actions, including detained and exit-banned U.S. citizens, human rights, and corrective—coercive activities in the South China Sea. We discussed all three of those things. I gave them names of individuals that we think are being held, and hopefully, we can get them released as well. No agreement on that. No agreement on that.\nI also stressed the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.\nIt's clear that we object to Beijing's nonmarket economic practices and disadvantaged—that disadvantage American businesses and workers and that we'll continue to address them. And I named what I thought a number of those were.\nI welcome the positive steps we've taken today, and it's important for the world to see that we're implementing the approach in the best traditions of American diplomacy. We're talking to our competitors. And the key—and just talking, just being blunt with one another so there's no misunderstanding is a key element to maintaining global stability and delivering for the American people.\nAnd, in the months ahead, we're going to continue to preserve and pursue high-level diplomacy with the P.R.C. in both directions to keep the lines of communication open, including between President Xi and me. He and I agreed that either one of us could pick up the phone, call directly, and we'd be heard immediately.\nAnd that's—now I'd like to be able to take some questions, if I may. And I'm told that Demetri [Demetri Sevastopulo] of the Financial Times has the first question.\nWell, holy God, I wouldn't have called on you if I had known that. [Laughter] No, I'm teasing. Go ahead. Fire away, Demetri.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Taiwan\nLook, I reiterate what I've said since I've become President and what every previous President of late has said: that we maintain an agreement that there is a \"one China\" policy and that—and I'm not going to change that. That's not going to change.\nAnd so that's about the extent to which we discussed it.\nNext question, sorry, was Bloomberg.\nWell, I made—had that discussion with him too, made it clear: I didn't expect any interference, any at all. And we had that discussion as he was leaving.\nLook, do I trust? You know, I—\"trust but verify,\" as that old saying goes. That's where I am.\nAnd you know, we're in a competitive relationship, China and the United States. But my responsibility is to make it—make this rational and manageable so it doesn't result in conflict.\nThat's what I'm all about, and that's what this is about: to find a place where we can come together and where we find mutual interests that—but most importantly, from my perspective, that are in the interests of the American people. That's what this is about, and that's exactly what we'll do.\nYou know, we're in a situation where we agreed that fentanyl and its precursors will be curbed substantially and the pill presses. That's a big movement. They're doing—and by the way, you know, I won't—I guess I shouldn't identify where it occurred. But, John, I know two people near where I live. Their kids, literally, as I said—strange as—they woke up dead. Someone had inserted in—whether the young man did or not—inserted, in a drug he was taking, fentanyl.\nAgain, I don't—I hope you don't have any experience with knowing anyone, but this is the largest killer of people in that age category.\nAnd you know, I guess the other thing I think is most important is that since I—I've spent more time with President Xi than any world leader has, just because we were Vice Presidents. His President was President Hu; I'm not making a joke. President Hu and—and President Obama thought we should get to know one another. It wasn't appropriate for the President of United States to be walking—dealing with the Vice President.\nSo we met—if I'm not mistaken, I think it was 68 hours of just face to face—just us and a simultaneous interpreter. So I think I know the man. I know his modus operandi. He's been—we have disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things. But he's been straight. I don't mean that he's good, bad, or indifferent. He's just been straight.\nAnd so, you know, we—as I said, the thing that I find most assuring is, he raised and I fully agreed that, either one of us have any concern, Mr. Ambassador—any concern about anything between our nations or happening in our region, we should pick up the phone and call one another, and we'll take the call. That's an important progress.\nI'm embarrassed—I think it's CBS, but I can't remember who with CBS. I'm sorry.\nSorry. [Laughter] I apologize.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Quadrilateral Security Dialogue\nWell, first of all, none of it did end up in a conflict, number one.\nNumber two, you may recall: I did a few little things like get the Quad together, allow Australia to have access to new submarines, moving in the direction of working with the Philippines. So our actions speak louder than our words. He fully understands.\nWell, look, we did discuss this, by the way. But we can't let it get out of control.\nHere's the situation: You have a circumstance where the first war crime is being committed by Hamas by having their headquarters, their military hidden under a hospital. And that's a fact. That's what's happened.\nIsrael did not go in with a large number of troops, did not raid, did not rush everything down. They've gone in, and they've gone in with their soldiers carrying weapons or guns. They were told—told—let me be precise. We've discussed the need for them to be incredibly careful. You have a circumstance where you know there is a fair number of Hamas terrorists. Hamas has already said publicly that they plan on attacking Israel again like they did before, do everything from cutting babies' heads off to burning women and children alive.\nAnd so the idea that they're going to just stop and not do anything is not realistic. This is not the carpet bombing. This is a different thing. They're going through these tunnels; they're going in the hospital.\nAnd if you notice, I was mildly preoccupied today. I apologize, I didn't see everything. But what I did see, whether—I haven't had it confirmed yet—I have asked my team to answer the question. But what happened is, they're also bringing in incubators. They're bringing in other—other means to help the people in the hospital, and they've given the doctors and—I'm told—the doctors and nurses and personnel an opportunity to get out of harm's way.\nSo this is a different story than I believe was occurring before, an indiscriminate bombing.\nWhat do you got? Washington Post. I think that's right.\nOh, there you are. Sorry. I couldn't see you in the light.\nI'm sorry, you're breaking up. I didn't—would you——\nYes, no—working backwards forward. Look, I have been deeply involved in moving on the hostage negotiation, and I don't want to get ahead of myself here because I don't know what's happened in the last 4 hours.\nBut they're—I have—we've gotten great cooperation from the Qataris. I've spoken with them as well a number of times. I think the pause and that Israeli—that the Israelis have agreed to is down to—I'm getting into too much detail. I know, Mr. Secretary. I'm going to stop.\nThe—but I am mildly hopeful. I'm mildly hopeful.\nWith regard to when is this going to stop, I think it's going to stop when the—when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse and just do horrific things to the Israelis. And they are in—and they still think they—at least as of this morning, they still thought they could.\nI guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution as they can in going after their targets. It's not like they're rushing in the hospital, knocking down doors, and you know, pulling people aside and shooting people indiscriminately.\nBut Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking the Israelis again. And this is a terrible dilemma. So what do you do?\nI think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks being killed in one-to-one—going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls. But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters, weapons, materiel below this hospital and, I suspect, others. But how long it's going to last, I don't know.\nLook, I made it clear to the Israelis that—and to Bibi and to his war cabinet that I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that's real. We've got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without worrying about whether or not we're just dealing with—they're dealing with Hamas—that's going to engage in the same activities they did over the past—on the 7th.\nSo it's—but I can't tell—I'm not a fortuneteller. I can't tell you how long it's going to last. But I can tell you I don't think it ultimately ends until there's a two-state solution. I made it clear to the Israelis I think it's a big mistake to—for them to think they're going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. I don't think that works.\nAnd so we're going to—I think you're going to see efforts to bring along—well, I shouldn't go into it anymore, because that's things I've been negotiating with Arab countries and others about what the next steps are.\nBut anyway, thank you all very much. Appreciate it very much.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Thank you. This ends the press conference.\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nWhen Hamas—well, Hamas said they plan on doing the same thing again—what they did—what they did on the 7th. They're going to go in—they want to slaughter Israelis. They want to do it again. And they've said it out loud. They're not kidding about it. They're not backing off.\nAnd so I just asked the rhetorical question, \"I wonder what we would do if that were the case?\"\nWhat I meant was, I'm doing everything in my power to get you out—coming to help you to get you out. I don't mean sending military in to get them. Is that what you thought I might mean?\nNo, no, no it's—it—I was not talking about a military. I was talking about we—you're on our mind every single day. Five to six times a day, I'm working on how I can be helpful in getting the hostages released and have a period of time where there's a pause long enough to let that happen.\nAnd there is somewhere between 50 and 100 hostages there, we think.\nYou're darn right it is. That's why I'm not going to stop till we get her.\nThank you. Thank you.\n[Several reporters asked questions at once.]\nWho can holler the loudest?\nNo, I can't tell you. I won't tell you.\nYes.\nYes.\nWell, look, he is. I mean, he's a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country that—it's a communist country that is based on a form of government totally different than ours.\nAnyway, we made progress.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-woodside-california"}
{"Title": "Interview with Tony Arias of Radio La Campesina", "Date": "2023-11-21", "Text": "I keep telling -- Everybody asks why I pay so much attention to the Latino community. 26 out of every 100 students in our schools -- kindergarten through 12th grade -- speak Spanish. If we don't pay attention, we're crazy. We're a nation of built-on diversity, and anyway -- but, I have no problem doing that. Matter of fact, I'm looking at a statue of Cesar Chavez, who almost cost me an election in 1972 when I ran. I supported him in Delaware, in agriculture areas. And we won -- Nixon won my state by 65% of the vote, and I won by 3,100 votes, but I keep the statue [Inaudible] keep looking at it.\nWell, it represents, to me, progress. Look, the reason I got involved, and I don't want to make a big deal of it, like I wasn't some great savior, but I supported him, was because he's fighting for just basic human rights, basic decency. They were putting these farm workers in basically old slave quarters. Not a joke, they -- they weren't allowed to go into the town of Georgetown, which is the capital of the -- Sussex County. I mean, it's just wrong. But he stands for everything that -- by the way, his granddaughter is my campaign manager -- for the United States, is part of our strength.\nWell look, I come from a family that's not dissimilar. I grew up in a family where we lived in a three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpa. And my dad would come home for dinner and go back to work. So, you know, we weren't poor, but we had no -- no expendable cash. I mean, it was just... and even going to the Catholic school -- high school I went to, we had to borrow the money to get there, and I worked in the summer cutting the lawn to be able to go. So we weren't poor, but I don't want to make it out like I'm, you know... but I do understand that it's paycheck to paycheck. My dad used to say, \"Joey, a job's about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'honey, it's going to be okay' and he meant it.\" And that's what I'm all about in terms of focusing on the growth of the middle class. When the middle class does well, everybody does. The poor have a shot up, and the wealthy still do fine, but they ought to start paying their fair taxes, I might add. But any rate, I -- I just think that we, -- I mean, look at all the great minds in the world, how many were Spanish speaking? How many are Latino? I mean, look at where... anyway, I just think it's we're being really very stupid and the way in which we handle immigration. And, you know, but my economic plan is working. There's 4.2 million more Hispanic Americans have jobs now than when I entered office two and a half years ago.\nWell look, I asked the same question, and the question -- the first major bill I sent to Congress was to reform the -- the immigration system. We are a country of immigrants. It's why we are strong. That is not hyperbole, that's a fact. And so, you know, what we're doing here is we're making sure that we're going to see to it that we have serious, serious effort to reform the immigration system. I proposed a comprehensive immigration reform on day one. We need Congress to act. My administration is providing a billion dollars in grant funding to support asylum seekers. We've secured record funding for border security and management. We continue to enforce the immigration laws, but we also... there's no reason why DREAMers shouldn't have a path to citizenship. I'm going to stay with it 'til, we get it done.\nHey, man, where have you been? I gave them a break. We, you know, the Supreme Court turned down my total debt forgiveness program, but I was able to see to it that I found other ways to move it. So I ended up with a situation where you've got millions of students have their total debt forgiveness. For example, we have a lower... We've lowered the burden of student debt. Since taking office, my administration has forgiven $127 billion in student debt for 3.6 million borrowers. We've doubled the amount for Pell Grants to get people to school. We've launched a thing called the SAVE program, the most generous income-driven repayment program ever. And we reduced monthly payments for millions of borrowers. We expanded access to early education. My budget secured a billion dollars -- a billion dollars for Head Start, and one in three beneficiaries for Head Start are Latinos. We expanded affordable high-speed internet for... I mean, we have done more for education for Latinos than any administration has, and it's real, and it matters.\nYeah. [Laughs]\nYes, yes, although, I saw one of me saying something that was off the wall. I couldn't tell it wasn't me. It was my... It lip-synced me perfectly. But my point is this: we're in a situation where we have enormous opportunity, enormous opportunity to grow the -- we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, the lowest interest rate in the world. I mean, we're doing better than any other major nation in the world. In the world. And one of the reasons we're growing and doing so well is because of the Latino community. It's not a joke. For example, I have more Latinos in my administration in the cabinet level than anybody else does. Four members of my cabinet are Latinos, more than any president before me. I made a commitment that I was -- when I became president, my government was going to look like America, and that's the case. I have -- and my senior staff across the board, and it looks like a country. It looks like a country. It looks Americans --\nYes, the message is: don't give up hope. Hope springs eternal. I know it's hard. I know it's hard. I come from a family that's been down and out in the past. I mean, it just -- you just got to keep our heads up. I promise you, we're not leaving the community. We're not leaving the people who need the most, because they're the ones who built the country. They're the ones that continue to build the country. And so I'd say, just hold on to one another. As my mom would say, keep the faith. Keep the faith. I really mean it.\nWell, I don't think I will either. I love tamales. So I'm not sure -- I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get that done, but we'll try. Well, invite me back. I'm like a poor relative. I show up. The wealthy ones never show up. The poor ones show up, stay longer than they should, and eat and all your food.\nThank you very much. Bye bye.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-tony-arias-radio-la-campesina"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine", "Date": "2023-12-12", "Text": "Please have a seat.\nPresident Zelenskyy, it's an honor to welcome you back to the White House.\nWhen President Putin launched his brutal total invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022 and Russian tanks rolled over the border toward Kyiv, there were those who thought Ukraine wouldn't survive for a month. So no one—no one—should forget that for you to be here today—again today, nearly 2 years later, and for Ukraine to be standing strong and free is an enormous victory already.\nPutin has failed—failed—in his effort to subjugate Ukraine. The brave people of Ukraine have defied Putin's will at every turn, backed by the strong and unwavering support of the United States and our allies and partners of more than 50 nations—50 nations—in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. And Ukraine will emerge from this war proud, free, and firmly rooted in the West, unless we walk away.\nThe American people can be and should be incredibly proud of the part they played in supporting Ukraine's success. We'll continue to supply Ukraine with critical weapons and equipment as long as we can, including $200 million I just approved today in a critical needed equipment: additional air-defense interceptors, artillery, and ammunition.\nBut without supplemental funding, we're rapidly coming to an end of our ability to help Ukraine respond to the urgent operational demands that it has. Putin is banking on the United States failing to deliver for Ukraine. We must, we must, we must prove him wrong.\nThe United States and Congress must, as I asked last week in this—it's stunning that we've gotten to this point. You know, we need to fully appreciate—fully appreciate—how it's wrong—how this is being viewed around the world and being used by Russia.\nRussian loyalists in Moscow celebrated when Republicans voted to block Ukraine's aid last week. The host of a Kremlin-run show literally said, and I quote: \"Well done, Republicans! That's good for us,\" end of quote. Let me say that again. This host of a Kremlin-run show said: \"Well done, Republicans! That's good for us.\" That's a Russian speaking.\nIf you're being celebrated by Russian propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you're doing. History will judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom's cause.\nToday, Ukraine's freedom is on the line. But if we don't stop Putin, it will endanger the freedom of everyone almost everywhere. Putin will keep going, and would-be aggressors everywhere will be emboldened to try to take what they can by force.\nThank you. Look, we're going to alternate asking questions. We're going to ask a total of—each ask two questions. And I will ask the first question—I will ask—I will recognize the first question asker. [Laughter.]\nI'll ask you a question to you all too. [Laughter]\nBut, Danny Kemp [Agence France-Presse].\nUkraine's Military Operations Against Russia/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine\nWell, let me answer the question first. Let's put this in perspective. Remember how far Ukraine has come. Russia has failed—failed thus far—in trying to erase Ukraine from the map and subsume it into Russia. Ukraine has taken back more than 50 percent of its territory seized since February of '22. And it's pushed back Russian—the Russian Navy so Ukraine can export grain and steel to the world through the Black Sea.\nAnd thanks to the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people and the bipartisan support from our Congress—but it's not just American support. There are more than 50 countries—50 countries—helping Ukraine with military, economic, and humanitarian assistance. Fifty.\nThe burden sharing: The U.S. has put up $75 billion, and our allies and partners have put up $100 billion. And more than 90 percent of our security assistance to Ukraine is being spent in the United States to provide weapons for Ukraine and replenish our stockpiles and build our industrial base.\nWe need to ensure Putin continues to fail in Ukraine and Ukraine to succeed. And the best way for that—to do that is to pass the supplemental.\nYour turn to ask a question.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]\nI mean to recognize someone.\n[President Zelenskyy called on a reporter in Ukrainian.]\nWe want to see Ukraine win the war. And, as I've said before, winning means Ukraine is a sovereign, independent nation and—that can afford to defend itself today and deter further aggression. That's our objective.\nTrevor [Trevor Hunnicutt], Reuters—with Reuters.\nWell, first of all, with regard to political support for Ukraine, there is a strong bipartisan political support for Ukraine. A small number of Republicans who don't want to support Ukraine, but they don't speak for the majority of even the Republicans, in my view.\nWe're in negotiations to get funding we need. Not to promise—not making promises, but hopeful we can get there. I think we can.\nAnd you're right. The world is watching what we do, which would send a horrible message to an aggressor and allies if we walked away at this time. And it would hurt our national security.\nSay it again.\nWell, I have had conversations with Bibi Netanyahu, and I want to make sure that we don't forget what we're doing here. We have to support Israel because they're an independent nation that's being—I mean, the brutality, the inhumanity, the way in which Hamas treated the Israelis and—I mean, raping and burning and beheading. I mean, it just—just beyond comparison—beyond comparison and—to anything else that I've seen since I've been here, and I've been around for a long time.\nBut I think that we have made it clear to the Israelis and they're aware that the independence—the safety of innocent Palestinians is still of great concern. And so the actions they're taking must be consistent with attempting to do everything possible to prevent innocent Palestinian civilians from being hurt, murdered, killed, lost, et cetera.\nAnd look, it doesn't lessen their responsibility, going after Hamas, to innocent Palestinians and—and Hamas. Look, we've—we have a responsibility to protect citizens and ensure they have access to humanitarian assistance. That's why I've worked so hard with our Arab friends, as well as the Israelis, to get humanitarian assistance into Israel, literally getting up to 140 trucks loaded with gear, loaded with food, loaded with everything that is needed by the Palestinians, including fuel.\nSo, you know, Israel has stated its intent to fulfill these responsibilities. It's very difficult.\nWith regard to the flooding of the tunnels, I'm not at liberty—well, there is assertions being made that they're quite sure there are no hostages in any of these tunnels. But I don't know that for a fact. I do know that, though, every civilian death is an absolute tragedy.\nAnd Israel has stated its intent, as I said, to match its words with a—its intent with word—with actions. That's why I was—that's what I was talking about today.\nQuestion three. I guess I asked that—no, I just asked that.\nIt's your turn.\nYour turn.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in Ukrainian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nWell, look, I'm very proud of how strong and unified NATO has become. And now it's even larger. I—Putin wanted the Finlandization of NATO when I met with him in Geneva right after I was elected. And he's gotten the NATO-ization of Finland instead.\nAnd NATO will be in Ukraine's future. No question about that. But if we—as said we said in Vilnius, Ukraine will become a member of NATO when all allies agree and conditions are met. Right now we have to make sure they win the war.\nAnd you know, we launched the joint declaration of support alongside President Zelenskyy and the G-7 leaders in Vilnius, outlining a long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine's defense needs.\nWe also hosted a defense industry conference last week here in DC to get that critical work done. So it's a step at a time.\nThank you all very, very much.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.This concludes the—thank you, everybody. Thank you, everyone. This concludes the press conference. Thanks, everybody.

{"Title": "Interview with Jonathan \"Bushman\" Dunnings on His Radio Show", "Date": "2024-02-26", "Text": "Hey, Bush. Bush, this is Joe Biden. How you doing, man?\nI'm doing fine. I understand it was 29 years since you went in there. When did you start, when you were 10?\nWell, I got elected to the Senate when I was 29. I was only 15. So, I get it.\nOK. Fire away, man. Thanks for having me.\nWell, I really think, Bush -- I think what's at stake is -- is literally our democracy, not a joke. I mean, this is a guy who, if you read or watch the things he says, is -- he is not a Democrat with a -- with a big D or a small D. And, I mean -- this guy says he's going to [inaudible] all the folks who killed those cops and -- and invaded the United States Congress, that they were patriots. And he wants to -- he's going to make sure, if he gets elected, he's going to make sure he frees them all. He talks about how he may -- he's going to have to excise parts of the constitution. I mean, this guy says things, and he means it, you know? And he said them at first in 2020, I wasn't sure he was as radical as he is. But I think a lot is at stake. And I think the living -- look, just as we've come to office, Bush, we've gotten a situation where we've improved the economy for all Americans, particularly Black Americans, significantly. And we have the most advanced economy in the world now. We've got a lot more work to do, don't get me wrong. But, you know, I think it's a -- but the threat to our democracy, our constitution, is really at stake. Trump's presidency would mean a return to chaos, division, violence, MAGA extremism. And this is the once-in-a-generation moment to stand up and save democracy and defend our rights. But it's going to take all of us. And Michigan played an important role in rejecting the MAGA extremists in 2020, putting us on a path to progress. And the primary is another opportunity to make your voice heard. So, I just want to make one thing clear. Polls open at 7:00 on Tuesday, close at 8:00. And -- and you go to iwillvote.com to find out your polling place. Make your voice heard, please.\nTheir vote is not as -- just as important. In a sense, it's more important. And the reason I say that is because, look, I got started in politics as a 29-year-old kid. Before that, in the civil rights movement. My -- my state was segregated by law. And I got involved as a kid in high school and desegregating anyway. So, it's -- we've come a long way. We've got a hell of a lot further to go, but we're making enormous, enormous progress. For example, if you think about it, you have a situation where we've been able to increase the, you know, the lowest unemployment rate in the history of America for African-Americans. We're in a situation where the -- we created 1.5 million new jobs, but 2.8 million are Black voters. Black wealth is up 60% since the pandemic. Black businesses started up at a faster rate than any time in 30 years. And Black families have health care coverage under the ACA more than ever before. Cut Black child poverty in half in three years. Black homeownership is up. We've invested 7 billion -- I come out of a -- I come out of HBCU background, and we've been --I've been able to invest $7 billion in HBCUs because they don't have the endowments to build the laboratories and backgrounds to train the workers for the high-paying jobs. Well, we invested $7 billion in HBCUs. We canceled -- we canceled $138 billion in student loans, and the Black borrowers borrowed more. And 3.9 million borrowers got their debt wiped out. We've increased -- just increased education opportunities. Pell grants, we've increased by 900 bucks, affecting 60% of the Black undergraduates. I could go on and on, but there's overwhelming reason why the -- and it's understandable why they don't know because a lot of this stuff took -- I worked like hell to pass the last three years. And it's all just kicking, you know, into play right now. And -- but I'm sorry. I'm talking too long, but I --\nI feel -- I feel really strongly about this, man. I really, really do. When I got elected -- I'd just say it. I promised if I got elected, I'd have an administration that looked like America. I have more African-Americans in positions of authority in my -- from the vice president to cabinet members. I've appointed more circuit courts of appeal judges or women than every other president in the history of the United States of America. You know, I just think it's important because what people are beginning to see is there's not a damn thing which I've known my whole life, the way I was raised, not a damn thing an African-American can't do that aybody else can do. They're just not given the shot. Everybody deserves a shot. And everybody -- my dad used to have an expression. He said, \"Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being treated well. It's about being given an even shot.\" And that's what it's all about. And that's what we're doing. And guess what? [inaudible] stepping up, man. Stepping up big time.\nDonald Trump. I know I can beat him, and I know he must be beaten. Think about it. All kidding aside, it's not a joke. Imagine if he gets reelected. He's committed to wipe out everything that we've done. Not -- and not generically, specifically wants to do away with the Affordable Care Act, which provides an incredible help for folks who, in fact, have preexisting conditions. He says he wants to do away with the cap I put on the ability of the Medicare to negotiate prices for drugs. How many people you know or I know will help a lot of people growing up who, in fact, and now who need insulin? Well, they're having to pay 400 bucks a month for these prescription drugs. Well, now, they only have to pay 35 bucks a month if you got a law passed saying Medicare could, in fact, negotiate those prices with the drug industry. And, by the way, you know what that does? That saves -- that saves the taxpayer $160 billion. Because instead of paying out -- it's not just on prescription, that prescription, but it's about -- for example, beginning at the end of this year, any senior receiving -- has a bill that exceeds -- a total bill exceeding $2,000 doesn't have to pay it because Medicare is going to take care of it because you can't -- and that's a big deal because some drugs are $14,000, $15,000 a year for cancer. And, you know, it's just about tax fairness. I mean, look, we're able to -- he wants to cut Social Security. He wants to cut Medicare. I mean, we got to stop it. I mean -- and these affect not only African-Americans, but primarily African-Americans and middle class and poor white folks, as well as Hispanics and Asians and others, minorities. And -- we just need -- we have to take him on.\nWell, Bushman, thank you for what you're doing, making -- look, the biggest thing is getting information to people. And with the way things work these days, it's awful hard to get that information out. And there's so many lies going out on the Internet, so many lies going out that it's hard to cut through. But with guys like you, Bushman, you -- you -- you've been straight up, and you've had a major impact on the community. And just remember, you know, go out and go to iwillvote.com to figure where you're going to vote because we need you. The country needs you. I really mean it. Don't let them talk you out of it.\nI look forward to personally meeting you, pal, if you're willing.\nOK.

{"Title": "Interview with Paul Allen \"P.A.\" Billings on His Radio Show", "Date": "2024-02-26", "Text": "Fine. And thanks for doing this in Africa.\nWell, I think what this -- first of all, Michigan is one of the five states that are going to determine the outcome of the election, based on the electoral votes and based on -- on the way -- how it was a toss up a lot of it is, number one. Number two, it's important because everything's at stake, literally. For example, you're in Africa. You know the guy I'm running against has no interest in working on Africa at all. So much we can do. I used to be chairman of that committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, when I was a young senator, and with the kind of thing you're doing, providing clothes, opportunities, just giving people a shot. And if we help them build their infrastructure -- for example, one of the proposals I have, we're going to build the largest solar facility in the world, and that's [inaudible] to help them deal with their problems and generate energy throughout the continent. We're going to build -- we want to build a railroad all the way across the [inaudible] from the ocean -- from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. There's so much we can do. There's a billion people [inaudible] a billion people.\nWell, let me tell you. Your -- your vote is your voice. There's been so many elections that have been decided by a single vote, by the way, a single vote. And by the way, had the chance [inaudible] Michigan had there been a change of vote [inaudible] a couple thousand people, would be a different outcome -- who is the president of the United States of America. So, it really does matter. And one of the reasons I ran was trying to unite America. But the MAGA Republicans, who spent [inaudible] this time from the last six years trying to divide America, convince people that they're not -- they have nothing in common. And so, the vote really does count, you know? And because Michiganders turned out to vote in 2020, we made a remarkable progress, lowering prescription drug costs, rebuilding roads and bridges, creating jobs, 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. So much at stake. Democracy, freedom, our economic -- economies on the line. And by the way, the polls open -- I know you're [inaudible] the polls open 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on -- from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Tuesday. And [inaudible] to tell you, listen, go to iwillvote.com to find a polling place because they can make a difference. They can make a gigantic difference.\nWell, first of all, you know, I got involved in politics as a kid in Delaware, which was segregated by law because of civil rights. And that's been my -- my passion from the time that I got involved. But, look, there's a lot of things that people may not be aware of. For example, I'm -- single, the people paying -- required the most to get to college and graduate school for the African-American community. Well, guess what? I was able to cancel $138 billion in student debt for more than 3.9 million borrowers. I've then increased Pell Grants with 60% of the Black undergraduates that need to get to school by 900 bucks and expanded it into 1.5 million more students. 610,000 new students from low-income backgrounds. And, look, the other thing is, just think of what we've done. We've created two point [inaudible] more -- there's a lower unemployment rate for Black Americans than any time in American history. Just in the last three years I've become president, more Black families have health care coverage under the ACA. Black child poverty has been cut in half. Home ownership is up. I've contributed -- we've provided $7 billion to HBCUs, which I've been very associated with, and canceled debt. We've increased maximum Pell Grants, etc. But there's a lot -- the basic thing is, when I got elected, I said I wanted an administration to look like [inaudible] America. I have more African-Americans in the cabinet, more African-Americans in my administration than any administration in history. I appointed the first African-American woman to the Supreme Court. It turns out they didn't even know it, but I've appointed more Black women to the -- to the circuits of courts of appeal than every other president combined in American history. It matters. It matters. There's not a damn thing the Black community can't do just [inaudible] give them a shot.\nSo, by the way, I was a big supporter of Bill Clinton, and I was a significant voice in the judiciary and foreign relations committees because I've been around for a long time when Bill Clinton got elected as a senator.\nAnd by the way, he and I are going to be campaigning in a couple of days together. He and I and Barack [inaudible]\nWell, thank you, pal. I look --\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-paul-allen-pa-billings-his-radio-show"}
{"Title": "Interview with Seth Meyers on NBC's \"Late Night\"", "Date": "2024-02-26", "Text": "Hello, everybody.\nIt's good to be back. Why haven't you invited me earlier?\nNo.\nAre you kidding me? I bragged about that all for a long, long time.\nAnd maybe the best gig I ever had, period.\nNo. No.\nNo, I resent the hell out of it.\nWhere are you getting this information? It's classified.\nThat's classified information.\nI'm not going to. But I will tell you, she did endorse me in 2020.\nI told you, it's classified.\nI'm not. I'm not.\nLook, I tell every world leader, and I mean this sincerely, never underestimate the ability of the American people. There's nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. Think about it. Every single crisis we've ever, ever, ever been in, we've come out stronger than we went in. Everyone. And folks, it's because of you, not because of your leaders. Because of you, really and truly. The American people are incredible. And we're the -- you know, I've told -- I asked -- I was asked by Xi Jinping about -- when I was in the Tibetan mountains with him, and he said can you define America for me? I said, yeah, one word, possibilities. America believes anything is possible. And by the way, people step up -- people here step up. And look what's happening. We've got the best economy in the world. Now, we've got a long way to go, but the best in the world now, and we're going to get it better.\nWho the hell told you that?\nThat's classified.\nWell, a couple of things. Number one, you got to take a look at the other guy. He's about as old as I am, but he can't even remember his wife's name.\nAnd -- number one. Number two, it's about how old your ideas are. Look, I mean, this is a guy who wants to take us back. He wants to take us back in Roe v. Wade. He wants to take us back on a whole range of issues that are 50, 60 years. They've been solid American positions. And -- and I really mean this sincerely. The -- I think it's about -- about the future. And everything -- every single thing we've done, I think we've gotten some good things done. Everything -- and they told us we couldn't get them done because things were so divided. And -- but I think everything -- everything we've gotten done, he's just frontally stated he wants to do away with if he gets elected. And I really think his views on where to take America are older than -- anyway, I don't want to get called.\nIt will be.\nLook, the 2020 agenda is to finish the job. For example, we're now in a position where we have the strongest economy of any major nation in the world, number one. We've got a way to go yet. Inflation is down, 880,000 manufacturing jobs. You know, we have some 14 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is the lowest it's been for the longest time. We're building wealth for people. But it really -- we have to do more. The first thing I have to do is stop it from being turned around. For example, you -- you talked about the border, it didn't pass. Well, guess what? We're going to pass that border. It's overwhelmingly -- overwhelmingly supported by Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. But because, I don't know this for a fact, but I was told that Trump was picking up the phone, calling the speaker of the House, saying don't let it pass. Why? Not because he doesn't think it's good. Because it will benefit Biden. That's no way to run a country. That's no way to deal. We didn't even -- when we had real divisions back when I was a young senator among Democrats and Republicans, that -- that -- that wasn't the way it worked. And look, I think -- let me put this, it's not your father's Republican Party. This is -- they got about 30% of the Republican Party controlling it all. And -- and I think it's -- we're going to break it.\nNot seems like, that's what he is saying. He's been saying it all along. He'd been saying it when he ran the last time. Look, the idea that any American -- think about this, if I told you all there was going to be an American president who said to Putin, Putin, come do whatever you want and -- to -- to NATO if they don't -- if the other guys on our team don't pay up every single cent they promised to pay for. I mean, what are we talking about here? What in God's name? How -- the idea that the president of the United States is inviting Vladimir Putin to invade Eastern or Western countries is bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. And it's totally against our interests. And by the way, I've known every major foreign leader for the longest time, and I know all these guys extremely well. They're scared to death of what it means for them -- for them, what it means if we walk away. Madeleine Albright was right, the former secretary of state. She said we are the essential nation. We are the essential nation. We don't have people fighting in those areas, but we're providing the wherewithal for them to be able to protect themselves. And it's just outrageous what he's talking about.\nThe first thing they do -- dictators do is they disregard whatever the rule of law is. They just disregard it. Here's the guy who says he wants to -- he thinks he can change the Constitution and ignore it. Just ignore portions of the Constitution. Here's the guy who talks about retribution. Here's the guy -- look, you have the guys -- the thousands of people who stormed the Capitol -- stormed the Capitol.\nWhat is -- I mean, that -- that's what happens in Eastern European countries. That's not what happens in America. We're -- and the idea that he thinks he can do that. The idea -- he talks about things like, for example, the idea that he said the Congress wants to pass an overwhelmingly a border provision that would allow us to control the border. The first bill I've ever introduced called for that. And here, they're saying, he's saying, no, don't do that because that'll help Biden. Help Biden? It's about -- not about Biden. It's about the United States of America. And look, it just -- I don't want to get started. I really don't.\nOur Democracy is at stake. It literally is.\nThere is a path forward with difficulty. But here's the path forward. Look, first of all, there are -- the hostages being held must be released. And then we've got -- and it's an in-principle agreement, there will be a cease-fire while that takes place. Ramadan is coming up, and there's been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well in order to give us time to get all the hostages out. That gives us time to begin to move in directions that a lot of Arab countries are prepared to move in. For example, Saudi Arabia is ready to recognize Israel. Jordan is -- Egypt. There are six other states I've been working with. Qatar. And the bottom line is that I'm not -- I think the only way Israel ultimately survives, and I make no bones about it, I get criticized for having said a long time ago, you need not be a Jew to be a Zionist. I'm a Zionist. Where there's no Israel, there's not a Jew in the world who'll be safe. But here's the deal. They also have to make up -- take advantage of an opportunity to have peace and security for Israelis and Palestinians who are being used as pawns by -- by the -- by Hamas. And so, there's a process underway that I think if we get that -- that temporary cease-fire, we're going to be able to move in a direction where we can change the dynamic and not have a two-state solution immediately, but a process to get to a two-state solution. A process to guarantee Israel's security and the independence of the Palestinians, but without them being able to, for example, invite in a, you know, another country to provide their defenses. There's ways to do this, and I don't have time to go into it now. But -- and in the meantime, there are too many innocent people that are being killed. And Israel has slowed down the attacks in Rafah. They have to -- and they've made a commitment to me they're going to see to it that there's an ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas. But -- but it's a process. And look, Israel has had the overwhelming support of the vast majority of nations. If it keeps this up without this incredibly conservative government they have, and Ben-Gvir and others, most -- I've known every major foreign policy leader in Israel since Golda Meir. They're going to lose support from around the world, and that is not in Israel's interest.\nI'm not going to take it back. We're going to give it to your kids.\nLet's get moving.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-seth-meyers-nbcs-late-night"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan", "Date": "2024-04-10", "Text": "Please, have a seat.\nIt's an honor to stand here today with the Prime Minister of Japan, President Kishida—Prime Minister Kishida.\nWhen I became President, I said that the United States would rebuild the muscle of our democratic alliances and we'd stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies again, because our alliances are America's greatest asset. The relationship with Japan is powerful proof of that—that in investing in our alliance and raising our collective ambitions, we yield remarkable results.\nOver the last 3 years, the partnership between Japan and the United States has been transformed into a truly global partnership. And that's thanks in no small part to the courageous leadership of Prime Minister Kishida. And I mean that sincerely.\nTogether, our countries are taking significant steps to strengthen defense and security cooperation, we're modernizing command and control structures, and we're increasing the interoperability and planning of our militaries so they can work together in a seamless and effective way. This is the most significant upgrade in our alliance since the end of—since it was first established.\nI'm also pleased to announce that for the first time, Japan and the United States and Australia will create a networked system of air, missile, and defense architecture. We're also looking forward to standing up a trilateral military exercise with Japan and the United Kingdom.\nAnd our AUKUS defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom is exploring how Japan can join our work in the second pillar, which focuses on advanced capabilities, including AI, autonomous systems. All told, that represents a new benchmark for our military cooperation across a range of capabilities.\nOn the economic front, our ties have never been more robust. Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States. Say that again: Japan is the top foreign investor in the United States. And we, the United States, are the top foreign investor in Japan. Nearly 1 million Americans work in Japanese companies here in the United States.\nAnd to name just one example, a few months ago, Toyota announced an $8 billion investment in a massive battery production facility in North Carolina, which will employ thousands of people. The Prime Minister is going to travel to North Carolina tomorrow to visit that project.\nDon't stay. Don't stay. We need you back in Japan. [Laughter] They'll probably try to keep you.\nWe also affirmed the science and education ties between Japan and the United States. Those tries—ties stretch up to the Moon, where two Japanese astronauts will join future American missions, and one will become the first non-American ever to land on the Moon.\nAnd they reach into the high schools and universities, as well, where the Mineta Ambassador—Minetas Program exists, named for our dear friend Norm Mineta. We're going to invest in new student exchanges, help train the next generation of Japanese and American leaders.\nWe also discussed developments in the Middle East, including our shared support for a cease-fire and a hostage deal and urgent efforts to deal with the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza.\nWe also want to address the Iranian threat to launch a—they—they're threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel. As I told Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad. Let me say it again: ironclad. We're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security.\nAnd finally, I want to commend the Prime Minister himself. He is a statesman. Command—you know, the fact is that you condemned Putin's invasion of—brutal invasion of Ukraine when it happened. You pledged more than $12 billion in aid; prioritizing nuclear nonproliferation at the United Nations Security Council; standing strong with the United States as we stand up for freedom of navigation, including in the South China Sea, and as we maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits; and taking the brave step of mending ties with the Republic of Korea so we can all stand shoulder to shoulder together.\nTomorrow we will both be joined by another good friend, President Marcos of the Philippines, for a trilateral summit, the first of its kind.\nAnd through it all, our commitment to the defense of Japan under article 5, including the —excuse me—Senkaku Islands, is unwavering.\nThank you. Now we'll take a few questions.\nJordan Fabian of Bloomberg.\nWell, I do stand by my prediction that before the year is out there will be a rate cut. This may delay it a month or so. I'm not sure of that. I don't—we don't know what the Fed is going to do for certain.\nBut, look, we have dramatically reduced inflation from 9 percent down to close to 3 percent. We're in a situation where we're better situated than we were when we took office, where we—inflation was skyrocketing. And we have a plan to deal with it, whereas the opposition—my opposition talks about two things. They just want to cut taxes for the wealthy and raise taxes on other people.\nAnd so I think they're—they have no plan. Our plan is one I think is still sustainable.\nI stand by my commitment to American workers. I can—man of my word, I'm going to keep it. And with regard to that, I stand by our commitment to our alliance. This is exactly what we're doing—a strong alliance as well.\n[Prime Minister Kishida began speaking, but his remarks were inaudible due to a technical malfunction.]\nYou know, first of all, we keep improving our lines of communications with one another—and that's the United States and China. We—I've met—I've recently spoken at length with President Xi. And we've agreed that we would, number one, have personal contact with one another whenever we want to discuss to anything so there'd be no—nothing lipped—nothing slips between, as they say—between the cup and the lip, so we know exactly what the other team is thinking. Number one.\nAnd so we had a long discussion last—now almost—I guess almost 2 weeks ago now. And—the best way to reduce the chances of miscalculation and misunderstanding. That's number one.\nNumber two, in our alliance we have with Japan—is a purely defensive in nature. It's a defensive alliance. And the things we discussed today improve our cooperation and are purely about defense and readiness. It's not aimed at any one nation or a threat to the region. And it doesn't have anything to do with conflict. And so this is about restoring stability in the region. And I think we have a chance of doing that.\nWith regard to my discussions with Bibi Netanyahu—Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as our relationship with Israel, I have been very blunt and straightforward with the Prime Minister, as well as his war cabinet, as well as the Cabinet.\nAnd the fact of the matter is that Bibi and I had a long discussion. He agreed to do several things that related to, number one, getting more aid—both food and medicine—into Gaza and reducing significantly the attempts—the civilian casualties in any action taken in the region.\nAnd thus far—and we—and it's tied to the hostages. There are a number of hostages that are being held by a—by the—Hamas. And just yesterday, we were meeting with the Vice President and our National Security Adviser before that, and they—and there are American hostages as well. And they know how committed we are—the whole team—to getting their loved ones home, and we're not going to stop until we do.\nThe new proposal on the table—Bill Burns led the effort to—for us, and we're grateful for his work—there's a now—up to Hamas. They need to move on the proposal that's been made. And as I said, it would get these hostages home where they belong, but also bring back a 6-week—cease-fire that we need now.\nAnd the fact is that we're—they're getting in somewhere, in the last 3 days, over a hundred trucks. It's not enough. But it needs to be more, and there's one more opening that has to take place in the north.\nSo we'll see what he does in terms of meeting the commitments he made to me.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.This will be the last reporter.\nWe did discuss this issue. We both agreed the D.P.R.K. must—must also address the serious human rights and humanitarian concerns of the international community, including the immediate resolution of the abduction issue.\nBut you know, the Prime Minister has just spoken to the potential of what his plans may mean. But welcome—I welcome the opportunity—we welcome the opportunity of our allies to initiate dialogue with the Democratic Republic of Korea.\nAs I've said many times, we're open to dialogue ourselves at any time, but without preconditions from the D.P.R.K.\nSo I have faith in the—Japan. I have faith in the Prime Minister. And I think his seeking a dialogue with them is a good thing. It's a positive thing.\nThank you. Thank——\nWhy doesn't everybody holler at once?\nElect me. I'm in the 20—it's the 20th century—21st century, not back then. They weren't even a State. I find——\nThank you. Thank you all very much. Thank you.\nBy the House—the war in Ukraine comes to an end by the House Leader allowing a vote. There's overwhelming support for Ukraine among the majority of Democrats and Republicans. There should be a vote now.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThere is no ban to Japan.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-fumio-kishida-japan"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President William Ruto of Kenya", "Date": "2024-05-23", "Text": "Good afternoon, everyone. Please have a seat.\nThank you, Mr. President. And you do have a friend. And you know, the African Continent is going to have a billion people not too soon. The idea we're going to ignore it, it makes no sense at all.\nFirst question: Michael Wilner, McClatchy.\nNo, one. [Laughter]\nOne question. I'll answer your question.\nYour question—your question with regard to Haiti is: We concluded that for the United States to deploy forces in the hemisphere just raises all kinds of questions that can be easily misrepresented about what we're trying to do and be able to be used by those who disagree with us and against our—against the interests of Haiti and the United States.\nSo we set out to find a partner or partners who would lead that effort that we would participate in, not with American forces, but with supplies and making sure they have what they needed. And so, you know, I'm very grateful for President Ruto's leadership here. A multinational effort, but Kenya's willingness to really lead this matter matters. You're not the only country, but you're leading this effort.\nAnd there's going to be U.S. Forces not on the ground, but we're going to supply logistics, intelligence, and equipment. Matter of fact, some equipment has already arrived. And Kenya is stepping up with police, and other countries plan to do as well. The United States is going to support the collective effort here.\nAnd of course, Kenya won't be going in alone. We're working with Congress to provide $300 million to MSS Mission and an additional $60 million for equipment assistance. And we have also—we have received and are continuing to bring major contributions from other partners in as well.\nPresident Ruto and I agree that the Haitian people deserve better. They deserve peace and security. And I thank him for taking on this responsibility. But we have his back, and we're there all the way.\nLook, we made my position known on ICC. You guys never keep the deal, but that's okay. [Laughter] That—you know, we've made our position clear on the ICC. We don't think the—we don't recognize their jurisdiction—the ICC—the way it's being exercised. And it's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.\nOkay, next. I—do I ask the next question as well?\nVery easily. [Laughter]\nThere's a reason why Afghanistan has been known as the \"graveyard of empires.\" The likelihood of anybody uniting Afghanistan is highly, highly, highly unlikely. Number one.\nNumber two, there are ways to control ISIS other than occupying Afghanistan. It was an unnecessary need.\nNow, with regard to Haiti, Haiti is in the area of the Caribbean that is very volatile. There's a lot going on in this hemisphere. And we're in a situation where we want to do all we can without us looking like America, once again, is stepping over and deciding \"this is what must be done.\"\nHaitians are looking for help, as well as the folks in the Caribbean are looking for help.\nAnd so we checked out with a number of other countries. The one who stepped up was Haiti [Kenya; White House correction]. We've committed to provide them the wherewithal—the intelligence and equipment and the like—to Haiti. And so it's a logical thing.\nAnd you have a first-rate capability, and you keep your word. That's an important dynamic.\nAnd by the way, you asked about—you implied that we weren't doing anything anywhere else. Well, we're kind of occupied around the world. But we're also engaging in Congo, in the neighborhood, and you know, we're going to continue to help alleviate human suffering there.\nThe United States is the largest humanitarian donor, providing $375 million in humanitarian funding just this year, including support for more than 6 million displaced people from the D.R.C. So we are engaged in more than one place.\nThe next question is from April Ryan [Grio].\nWhat was my question? [Laughter]\nYes.\nYes.\nThe very way we're doing it. We're not talking about a thousand-person army that's made up of trained persons—this is a crisis that's able to be dealt with. And we think we can—dealt with this way with a multinational approach with Haiti leading the way and us providing the intelligence as well as equipment.\nIs that it?\nWould you—I'm sorry. I didn't catch all your question.\nYes.\nWe made a major commitment to this.\nNumber one, as I said, the United States has long championed international financial institutions that provide low-cost concessional resources to the poorest developing countries, including from the IMF.\nTo that end, my administration helped design and establish the IMF's new initiative that provides low-cost funding to—for countries that are taking steps to enhance their resilience. Important partners in Africa have the capital they—ensure they have their capital they need to invest in their futures.\nWe heard them, and we stand with them. Now, that's why we've worked with Congress to enable the United States to make available in the coming weeks up to $21 billion in new lending resources to the IMF trust fund that provides concessional lending to the poorest countries.\nIt's a little like a—you know, having to go—when you're in debt, having to go and find someone to help you out. That's what this is about.\nWe believe supporting your friends and in this partnership is happy to—we were happy to do our part.\nAnd look, we've also doubled our commitment to the IDA. And I'm proud the United States is the biggest donor to the IDA in this cycle and proud to be working with—alongside Kenya to support robust financing and a policy package that are going to help the most vulnerable countries address their investment needs.\nThere's debt and there's growth, and you can't—you've got to deal with the debt before you deal with the growth. And so what we're—we're trying to use international lending organizations to be able to provide that capability so people can grow. That's what it's about.\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nWhoa! [Laughter]\nThank you, all. Thanks.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-william-ruto-kenya"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine in Savelletri di Fasano, Italy", "Date": "2024-06-13", "Text": "Good evening, everyone.\nLast year, at the NATO summit in Lithuania, the United States brought together every member of the G-7 to sign a joint declaration of support for Ukraine. Twenty-five additional countries joined us quickly. Each agreed to forge a long-term bilateral commitments to—with Ukraine.\nPresident Zelenskyy and I have just now signed that agreement between the United States and Ukraine. Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine's credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term. A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine's own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime in the future.\nThe United States is going to help ensure that Ukraine can do both, not by sending American troops to fight in Ukraine, but by providing weapons and ammunition; expanding intelligence-sharing; continuing to train brave Ukrainian troops at bases in Europe and the United States; enhancing interoperability between our militaries in line with NATO standards; investing in Ukraine's defense industrial base so in time—in time—they can supply their own weapons and munitions; working with Ukraine's partners to build a future force that is strong, sustainable, and resilient; and supporting Ukraine's economic recovery as well as its energy recovery after Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's energy grid with massive attacks in the futile attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people. All these lines of efforts and others are laid out in this agreement.\nAdditionally, the G-7 achieved a significant outcome this week on the matter of Russia's frozen assets in Europe and other places outside of Russia. Back in 2022, 2 days after Russia's invasion, members of the G-7 and the European Union worked together to freeze $280 billion in Russian Central Bank funds outside of Russia.\nI'm very pleased to share that, this week—this week—the G-7 signed a plan to finalize and unlock $50 billion from the proceeds of those frozen assets, to put that money to work for Ukraine. Another reminder to Putin: We're not backing down. In fact, we're standing together against this illegal aggression.\nThe agreement that President Zelenskyy and I just signed also lays out our shared vision for a just peace, a peace rooted in the U.N. Charter and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, a peace with a broad base of support around the world that holds Russia accountable for the damage it has done in this war.\nWe will see this vision strongly affirmed at the historic peace conference happening in Switzerland this weekend, where Vice President Harris will represent the United States.\nFinally, this agreement accelerates Ukraine's integration into the European and Atlantic—trans-Atlantic communities. It includes major commitments from Ukraine to impact—and to—excuse me—to implement democratic, economic, and security reforms in line with the European Union's accession goals and NATO's programs of reforms.\nWhile we take this step, the United States is also intensifying pressure on Russia. Yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department made clear any bank anywhere in the world that deals with sanctioned Russian banks, companies, or individuals risks being sanctioned themselves.\nAnd we announced roughly 300 new sanctions on individuals and companies that are helping Russia's war effort. They include key parts of Russia's financial sector——\n[At this point, an aircraft could be heard overhead.]\nI'll wait until it goes over—as well as individual and entities that supply Russia with items critical to its defense production, like microelectronics, machine tools, and industrial materials.\nWe also—we also—sanctioned more Russian future energy projects that—Russia's natural gas and oil projects that are under construction and are not yet fully operating. Putin is counting on revenues from those projects. Our sanctions will disrupt those plans.\nPlus, at the G-7, we discussed our shared concern about countries like China who are supplying Russia with materials they need for their war machine. And we agreed to taking collective action to push back against that activity.\nLet me close with this. We've taken three major steps at the G-7 that collectively show Putin we cannot—he cannot wait us out, he cannot divide us, and we'll be with Ukraine until they prevail in this war.\nFirst is the bilateral security agreement just signed. Second, a historic agreement to provide $50 billion in value from Russian sovereign assets to Ukraine. And third, an agreement to ensure our sanctions efforts disrupt third countries that are supplying Russia's war efforts. That will increase pressure on the Russian economy.\nCollectively, this is a powerful set of actions, and it will create a stronger foundation for Ukraine's success.\nTwo and a half years ago, Putin unleashed a brutal war on Ukraine. And it's been a horrifying ordeal for the Ukrainian people that are so brave and incredible. It's also been a test for the world: Would we stand with Ukraine? Would we stand for sovereignty, freedom, and against tyranny?\nThe United States, the G-7, and countries around the world have consistently answered the question by saying, \"Yes, we will.\" And we will say it again. Yes, again and again and again, we're going to stand with Ukraine.\nAnd thank you. And I now yield to my friend from Ukraine, the President.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]\nNow what we'll do is—we're each going to take two questions from American reporters and two—a question each from two American reporters and a question each from two Ukrainian supporters—reporters.\nThe first person I'm to call on is Colleen Long of the Associated Press.\nUkraine/Russia/President Biden's Son R. Hunter Biden\n——then you ask his question. Okay?\nWith regard to the first question, it is clear that the near abroad, meaning just across the line of the border with Russia and Ukraine, that it makes a lot of sense for Ukraine to be able to take out or combat what is coming across that border. In terms of long-range weapons—longer range weapons into the interior of Russia, we have not changed our position on that sort.\nWith regard to the question regarding the family, I'm extremely proud of my son Hunter. He has overcome an addiction. He is—he's one of the brightest, most decent men I know. And I am satisfied that—I'm not going to do anything. I said I'd abide by the jury decision, and I will do that. And I will not pardon him.\nDo you want to call on a Ukrainian reporter?\n[President Zelenskyy spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nI'd be happy to respond to that. We have acquired commitment from five countries so far for Patriot batteries and other air defense systems as well as, we've let it be known to those countries that are expecting from us air defense systems in the future that they're going to have to wait. Everything we have is going to go to Ukraine until their needs are met. And then we will make good on the commitments we made to other countries.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]\nYou'll have some relatively quickly.\nAmerican reporter. Josh Winegrove [Wingrove; White House correction], Bloomberg.\nI wish you guys would, a little, play by the rules a little bit.\nI'm here to talk about a critical situation in Ukraine. You're asking me another subject; I'll be happy to answer it in detail later. But the bottom line is that we've made an agreement—I've laid out an approach that has been endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, by the G-7, by the Israelis, and the biggest hangup so far is Hamas refusing to sign on even though they have submitted something similar.\nWhether it has—now to—comes to fruition remains to be seen. We're going to continue to push. I don't have a final answer for you.\nBy the way, the idea that we had to wait until we passed the legislation overall, being held up by a small majority of our Republican colleagues, was just terrible. And there's a lot more money coming beyond what's already come in the other tranches that are available now that we've passed the legislation. So they'll have what they need and get it there as quickly as we possibly can.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nWhat was the last part of your question?\nThe steps we're going to take to make sure it has—Ukraine has victory and that Russia does not prevail is continued support—what we just signed. We signed that, and a significant number of nations have signed it.\nWe have convinced the G-7—convinced—we've got the support of the G-7 and, quite frankly, 48 other countries. We sat with the Prime Minister of Japan, South Korea. We have—50 nations have signed up, beyond NATO and the G-7. And so we're going to stay as long as it takes.\nWith regard to the plan, that is a—that is a plan in process now. We're discussing with our Ukrainian friends exactly what it would be. We have a lot of movement toward that. We know the outlines of it. We have not done the detail of it all. But we know what Ukraine is capable of doing when given the material to defend themselves, and that's exactly what they're doing now.\nBy the way, China is not supplying weapons, but the ability to produce those weapons and the technology available to do it. So it is, in fact, helping Russia.\nThank you all so very much. Appreciate it.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.This concludes our press conference. Thank you, everybody.\n[President Zelenskyy spoke in English as follows.]", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-ukraine-savelletri-di"}
{"Title": "Presidential Debate in Atlanta, Georgia", "Date": "2024-06-27", "Text": "Folks, how are you? Good to be here. Thank you.\nWe've got to take a look at what I was left when I became president, what Mr. Trump left me.\nWe had an economy that was in freefall. The pandemic was so badly handled. Many people were dying. All he said was it's not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm. You'll be all right.\nThe economy collapsed. There were no jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 15 percent. It was terrible.\nAnd so, what we had to do is try to put things back together again. And that's exactly what we began to do. We created 15,000 new jobs. We brought out in a position where we have 800,000 new manufacturing jobs.\nBut there's more to be done. There's more to be done. Working-class people are still in trouble.\nI come from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I come of household where the kitchen table – if things weren't able to be met during the month, was a problem. Price of eggs, the price of gas, the price of housing, the price of a whole range of things.\nThat's why I'm working so hard to make sure I deal with those problems, and we're going to make sure that we have reduced the price of housing. We're going to make sure we build 2 million new units. We're going to make sure we cap rents, so corporate greed can't take over.\nThe combination of what I was left with and corporate greed are the reason why we're in this problem right now.\nIn addition to that, we're in a situation where if you had to take a look at all that was done at his administration, he didn't do much at all. By the time he left, there's – things were in chaos, literally chaos.\nAnd so we put things back together. We created, as I said, those jobs. We made sure we had a situation where we now – we brought down the price of prescription drugs, which is a major issue for many people, to $15 for – for an insulin shot, as opposed to $400. No senior has to pay more than $200 for any drug, all the drugs they can include (ph) beginning next year.\nAnd the situation is making – and we're going to make that available to everybody, to all Americans. So we're working to bring down the price of – around the kitchen table. And that's what we're going to get done.\nWell, look, the greatest economy in the world, he's the only one who thinks that, I think. I don't know anybody else who thinks it was great – he had the greatest economy in the world.\nAnd, you know, the fact of the matter is that we found ourselves in a situation where his economy, he rewarded the wealthy. He had the largest tax cut in American history, $2 trillion. He raised the deficit larger than any president has in any one term. He's the only president other than Herbert Hoover who has lost more jobs than he had when he began, since Herbert Hoover. The idea that he did something that was significant.\nAnd the military, you know, when he was president, they were still killing people in Afghanistan. And he didn't do anything about that. When he was president, we were still finding ourselves in a position where you had a notion that we were this safe country. The truth is, I'm the only president this century that doesn't have any this – this decade, that doesn't have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like he did.\nHe had the largest national debt of any president in a four-your period, number one. Number two, he – that $2 trillion tax cut benefited the very wealthy. I – what I'm going to do is fix the tax system.\nFor example, we have a thousand trillionaires in America – I mean, billionaires in America. And what's happening? They're in a situation where they, in fact, pay 8.2 percent in taxes. If they just paid 24 percent or 25 percent, either one of those numbers, they'd raised $500 million – billion dollars, I should say, in a 10-year period.\nWe'd be able to right wipe out his debt. We'd be able to help make sure that all those things we need to do – childcare, elder care, making sure that we continue to strengthen our healthcare system, making sure that we're able to make every single solitary person eligible for what I've been able to do with the – with – with – with the COVID. Excuse me, with dealing with everything we have to do with – look, if – we finally beat Medicare.\nIt's been a terrible thing, what you've done.\nThe fact is that the vast majority of constitutional scholars supported Roe when it was decided, supported Roe. And that was – that's – this idea that they were all against it is just ridiculous.\nAnd this is the guy who says the states should be able to have it. We're (ph) in a state where in six weeks, you don't even know whether you're pregnant or not, but you cannot see the doctor or have your – and have him decide on what your circumstances are, whether you need help.\nThe idea that states are able to do this is a little like saying, we're going to turn civil rights back to the states. Let each state have a different rule.\nLook, there's so many young women who have been – including a young woman who just was murdered and he – he went to the funeral. The idea that she was murdered by a – by –by an immigrant coming in, and they talk about that. But here's the deal, there's a lot of young women who are being raped by their – by their in-laws, by their – by their spouses, brothers and sisters, by – just – it's just – it's just ridiculous. And they can do nothing about it.\nAnd they tried to arrest them when they cross state lines.\nI supported Roe v. Wade, which had three trimesters. First time is between a woman and a doctor. Second time is between the doctor and an extreme situation. And a third time is between the doctor – I mean, it'd be between the woman and the state.\nThe idea that the politicians – that the founders wanted the politicians to be the ones making decisions about women's health is ridiculous. That's the last – no politician should be making that decision.\nA doctor should be making those decisions. That's how it should be run. That's what you're going to do.\nAnd if I'm elected, I'm going to restore Roe v. Wade.\n[off-mike] No.\n[off-mike] You're lying.\nThat is simply not true. That Roe v. Wade does not provide for that. That's not the circumstance. Only when the woman's life is in danger, if she's going to die – that's the only circumstance in which that can happen.\nBut we are not for late term abortion, period – period, period.\nFor 51 years, that was the law. Fifty-one years, Constitutional Scholarship said it was the right way to go. Fifty-one years, and it was taken away because this guy put very conservative members on the Supreme Court. He takes credit for taking it away.\nWhat's he going to do? What's he going to do, in fact, if – if the MAGA Republicans – he gets elected and the MAGA Republicans control of the Congress and they pass a universal ban on abortion, period, across the board, at six weeks, or seven, or eight or ten weeks, something very, very conservative. Is he going to sign that bill?\nI'll veto it. He'll sign it.\nBecause we worked very hard to get a bipartisan agreement that not only changed all of that, but it made sure that we are in a situation where you had no circumstance where they could come across the border with the number of border police there are now. We significantly increased the number of asylum officers. Significantly – by the way, the Border Patrol men endorsed me, endorsed my position.\nIn addition to that, we found ourselves in a situation where, when he was president, he was taking – separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure the families were separated. That's not the right way to go.\nWhat I've done – since I've changed the law, what's happened? I've changed it in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40 percent fewer people coming across the border illegally. That's better than when he left office.\nAnd I'm going to continue to move until we get the total ban on the – the total initiative relative to what we're going to do with more Border Patrol and more asylum officers.\nThe only terrorist who has done anything crossing the border is one who came along and killed three under his administration, killed – an al-Qaida person in his administration, killed three American soldiers – killed three American soldiers. That's the only terrorist that's there.\nI'm not saying no terrorist ever got through. But the idea they're emptying their prisons, we're welcoming these people, that's simply not true. There's no data to support what he said. Once again, he's exaggerating. He's lying.\nEvery single thing he said is a lie, every single one. For example, veterans are a hell of a lot better off since I passed the PACT Act. One million of them now have insurance, and their families have it. And their families have it, because what happened, whether was Agent Orange or burn pits, they're all being covered now. And he – his group opposed that.\nWe're also in a situation where we have great respect for veterans. My – my son spent a year in Iraq, living next to one of those burn pits, came back with stage four glioblastoma. I was recently in – in – in France for D-Day, and I spoke to all – about those heroes that died. I went to the World War II cemetery – World War I cemetery he refused to go to. He was standing with his four-star general, and he told him – he said, \"I don't want to go in there because they're a bunch of losers and suckers.\"\nMy son was not a loser. He was not a sucker. You're the sucker. You're the loser.\nYou had a four-star general stand at your side, who was on your staff, who said you said it, period. That's number one.\nAnd, number two, the idea – the idea that I have to apologize to you for anything along the lines. We've done more for veterans than any president has in American history – American history. And they now – and their family. The only sacred obligation we have as a country is to care for our veterans when they come home, and their families, and equip them when they go to war.\nThat's what we're doing. That's what the V.A. is doing now. They're doing more for veterans than ever before in our history.\nI've never heard so much malarkey in my whole life. Look, the fact of the matter is that we're in a situation where – let's take the last point first, Iran attacked American troops, killed, caused brain damage for a number of these troops, and he did nothing about it. Recently, when he was president, they attacked. He said, they're just having headaches. That's all it is. We didn't do a thing when the attack took place. Number one.\nNumber two, we got over 100,000 Americans and others out of Afghanistan during that airlift. Number three, we found ourselves in a situation where, if you take a look at what Trump did in Ukraine, he's – this guy told Ukraine – told Trump, do whatever you want and do whatever you want. And that's exactly what Trump did to Putin, encouraged him, do whatever you want. And he went in.\nAnd listen to what he said when he went in, he was going to take Kyiv in five days, remember? Because it's part of the old Soviet Union. That's what he wanted to re-establish Kyiv. And he in fact, didn't do it at all. He didn't – wasn't able to get it done. And they've lost over – they've lost thousands and thousands of troops, 500,000 troops.\nThe fact is that Putin is a war criminal. He's killed thousands and thousands of people. And he has made one thing clear, he wants to re-establish what was part of the Soviet Empire, not just a piece, he wants all of Ukraine. That's what he wants. And then do you think he'll stop there? Do you think he'll stop when he – if he takes Ukraine? What do you think happens to Poland? What do you think of Belarus? What do you think happens to those NATO countries?\nAnd so, if you want a war, you ought to find out what he's going to do. Because if, in fact, he does what he says and walks away – by the way, all that money we give Ukraine and from weapons we make here in the United States, we give them the weapons, not the money at this point. And our NATO allies have produced as much funding for Ukraine as we have. That's why it's – that's why we're strong.\nNumber one, everyone from the United Nations Security Council straight through to the G7 to the Israelis and Netanyahu himself have endorsed the plan I put forward, endorsed the plan I put forward, which has three stages to it.\nThe first stage is to treat the hostages for a ceasefire. Second phase is a ceasefire with additional conditions. The third phase is know the end of the war. The only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas, number one. They're the only ones standing down (ph).\nWe're still pushing hard from – to get them to accept. In the meantime, what's happened in Israel? We're finally – the only thing I've denied Israel was 2,000-pound bombs. They don't work very well in populated areas. They kill a lot of innocent people. We are providing Israel with all the weapons they need and when they need them. And by the way, I'm the guy that organized the world against Iran when they had a full-blown kind of ballistic missile attack on Israel. No one was hurt. No one Israeli was accidentally killed. And it stopped. We saved Israel. We are the biggest producer of support for Israel than anyone in the world. And so, that's – they are two different things.\nHamas cannot be allowed to be continued. We continue to send our experts and our intelligence people to how they can get Hamas like we did Bin Laden. You don't have to do it. And by the way, they've been greatly weakened, Hamas, greatly weakened, and they should be. They should be eliminated. But, you got to be careful for what you use these certain weapons among population centers.\nI've never heard so much foolishness. This a guy who wants to get out of NATO. You're going to stay in NATO or you're going to pull out of NATO? The idea that we have – our strength lies in our alliances as well. It may be a big ocean, but we're ever able to avoid a war in Europe, a major war in Europe? What happens if in fact you have Putin continue to go into NATO? We have an Article Five agreement, attack on one is attack on all. You want to start the nuclear war he keeps talking about. Go ahead. Let Putin go in and control Ukraine and then move on to Poland and other places. See what happens then.\nHe has no idea what the hell he is talking about. And by the way, I got 50 other nations around the world to support Ukraine, including Japan and South Korea, because they understand that this was this – this kind of dislocation has a serious threat to the whole world peace. No major war in Europe has ever been able to be contained just to Europe.\nLook, he encouraged those folks to go up on Capitol Hill, number one. I sat in that dining room off the Oval Office – he sat there for three hours, three hours watching, begging, being begged by his vice president and a number of his colleagues and Republicans as well to do something, to call for a stop, to end it. Instead, he talked – they've talked about these people being patriots and – and great patrons of America.\nIn fact, he says he'll not forgive them for what they've done. They've been convicted. He says he wants to commute their sentences and say that, no, he went to every single court in the nation, I don't know how many cases, scores of cases, including the Supreme Court. And they said they said – they said, no, no, this guy, this guy is responsible for doing what is being – was done. He didn't do a damn thing. And these people should be in jail. And they should be the ones who are being held accountable. And he wants to let them all out.\nAnd now he says if he loses again, such a whiner that he is, that there could be a bloodbath.\nThe only person on this stage that is a convicted felon is the man I'm looking at right now. And the fact of the matter is he is – what he's telling you is simply not true. The fact is that there was no effort on his part to stop what was going on up on Capitol Hill. And all those people, every one of those who were convicted deserves to be convicted. The idea that they didn't kill somebody, just went in and broke down doors, broke the windows, occupied offices, turned over desks, turned them over, statues, the idea that those people are patriots? Come on.\nWhen I asked him about first of two debates we had – debates we had the first time around, I said, will you denounce the Proud Boys. He said, no, I'll tell them stand by. The idea he's refusing – will you denounce these guys? Will you denounce the people we're talking about now? You denounce the people who attacked that Capitol? What are you going to do?\nThe idea that I did anything wrong relative to what you're talking about is outrageous. It's simply a lie, number one.\nNumber two, the idea that you have a right to seek retribution against any American, just because you're a president, is wrong, is simply wrong. No president's ever spoken like that before. No president in our history has spoken like that before.\nNumber three, the crimes that you are still charged with. And think of all the civil penalties you have. How many billions of dollars do you owe in civil penalties for molesting a woman in public, for doing a whole range of things, of having sex with a porn star on the night – and while your wife was pregnant?\nI mean, what are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.\nThe more they know about what he's done, yes. The more they know about what he's done.\nAnd there's a lot more coming. He's got a lot of cases around the road coming around. He's got – he's got a whole range of issues he has to face. I don't know what the juries will do, but I do know – I do know he has a real problem.\nAnd so the fact that – could you ever think you're hearing any president say that, I'm going to seek retribution? Do you ever hear any president say that, I thought it would write some good ideas?\nWhat got me involved to run in the first place after my son had died, I decided – in Iraq – because of Iraq. I said, I wasn't going to run again, until I saw what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia. People coming out of the woods carrying swastikas on torches and singing the same anti-Semitic bile they sang back in Germany.\nAnd what did – and the young woman got killed, they spoke to the mother. And she – they asked him, they said, what – well, what do you think of those people? The people who wanted to get killed, the ones who tried to stop it, and the ones who said, I think they're fine people on both sides.\nWhat American president would ever say, Nazis coming out of fields, carrying torches, singing the same anti-Semitic bile, carrying swastikas, were fine people.\nThis is a guy who says Hitler's done some good things. I'd like to know what they are. The good things Hitler's done, that's what he said. This guy has no sense of American democracy.\nAnd debunk. It happened. All you have to do is listen to what was said at the time.\nAnd the idea that somehow that's the only reason I ran. I ran because I was worried a guy like this guy can get elected.\nIf he thought they were good people coming out of that all – that for us, carrying those – those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn't deserve to be president, didn't deserve to be president at all.\nAnd the idea that he's talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking to the windows. We saw people occupying there.\nHis own vice president – look, there's a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused endorsing this time. His vice president hasn't endorsed him this time.\nSo, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?\nThey acknowledge he made a lot of progress, number one. The facts of the matter is more small black businesses that have been started in any time in history. Number two, the wages of black – black unemployment is the lowest level of spend in a long, long time. Number three, we find them – they're trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate – these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.\nAnd in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the – the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We've got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We've got to make sure – because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the – in the job market.\nSo there's more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it.\nI say, I don't blame them for being disappointed. Inflation is still hurting them badly. For example, I provided for the idea that any black family, first time home buyer should get a $10,000 tax credit to be able to buy their first home so they can get started.\nI made sure that we're in a situation where all those black families and those black individuals who provided had to take out student loans that were ballooning, that if they were engaged in nursing and anything having to do with volunteerism, if they paid their bills for 10 years on their student debt, all the rest was forgiven after 10 years. Millions have benefited from that and we're going to do a whole lot more for black families.\nThere was no inflation when I became president. You know why? The economy was flat on its back. 15% unemployment, he decimated the economy, absolutely decimated the economy. That's why there was no inflation at the time.\nThere were no jobs. We provided thousands of millions of jobs for individuals who were involved communities, including minority communities. We made sure that they have health insurance. We have covered with the ACA has increased. I made sure that they're $8,000 per person in the family to get written off in health care, but this guy wants to eliminate that. They tried 50 times. He wants to get rid of the ACA again, and they're going to try again if they win.\nWe find ourselves in a position where the idea that we're not doing any – I put more – we put more police on the street than any administration has. He wants to cut the cops. We're providing for equity, equity, and making sure people have a shot to make it. There is a lot going on. But, on inflation, he caused it by his tremendous amount of seasons in the way he handled the pandemic.\nI don't know where the hell he has been. The idea that, Dana, he said is true. I've passed the most extensive, it was the extensive climate change legislation in history, in history. We find ourselves – and by the way, black colleges, I came up with $50 billion for HBCUs, historic black universities and colleges, because they don't have the kind of contributors that they have to build these laboratories and the like. Any black student is capable in college in doing any white student can do. They just have the money. But now, they'll be able to get those jobs in high tech.\nWe're in a situation where the idea that he kind of is claiming to have done something that had the cleanest water, the cleanest water? He had not done a damn thing with the environment. He – out of the Paris Peace Accord – Climate Accord, I immediately joined it, because if we reach for 1.5 degrees Celsius at any one point, well, there is no way back. The only existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn't do a damn thing about it. He wants to undo all that I've done.\nWhere does that come from? The idea is that we, in fact – we were the only ones of consequence or not. We're not members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything we're not able to, the United States can't get this under control? One of the largest polluters in the world. Number one, we're making significant progress. By 2035, we will have cut pollution in half.\nWe have – we have made significant progress. And we're continuing to make progress.\nWe set up a Climate Corps for thousands of young people will learn how to deal with climate, just like the Peace Corps. And we're going to – we're moving in directions that are going to significantly change the elements of the cause of pollution.\nBut the idea that he claims that he has the biggest heart up here and he's really concerned about – about pollution and about climate, I've not seen any indication of that.\nAnd, by the way, with regard to prescription drugs, one company agreed that they would reduce the price to $35, which I was calling for – one, voluntarily. I made sure every company in the world, every pharmaceutical company, cannot have to pay.\nYes, make the very wealthy begin to pay their fair share. Right now, everybody making under $170,000 pays 6 percent of their income, of their paycheck, every single time they get a paycheck, from the time of the first one they get when they're 18 years old.\nThe idea that they're going to – I'm not – I've been proposing that everybody, they pay – millionaires pay 1 percent – 1 percent. So no one after – I would not raise the cost of Social Security for anybody under $400,000. After that, I begin to make the wealthy begin to pay their fair share, by increasing from 1 percent beyond, to be able to guarantee the program for life.\nWell, that one enough will keep it solvent. But the biggest thing I'll do, if we defeat this man, because he wants to get rid of Social Security; he thinks that there's plenty to cut in Social Security. He's wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare, both times. And that's with – and if you look at the program put forward by the House Republican Caucus that he, I believe, supports, is in fact wanting to cut it as well.\nThe idea that we don't need to protect our seniors is ridiculous. We put – and, by the way, the American public has greater health care coverage today than ever before. And under the ACA, as I said, you're in a circumstance where 400,000 people – I mean, 40 million people – would not have insurance because they have a pre-existing condition. The only thing that allows them to have that insurance is the fact that they in fact are part of the ACA.\nAnd, by the way, the other thing is we're in a situation where I talk about education for black communities. I've raised the number, the amount of money for Pell grants by other $8,000 for anybody making under $70,000 a year, are going to be able to get $15,000 towards their tuition.\nIt's just – he – he just doesn't know what he's talking about.\nThe idea that veterans are not being taken care of, I told you before – and, by the way, when I said \"suckers and losers,\" he said – he acknowledged after it that he fired that general. That general got fired because he's the one that acknowledged that that's what he said. He was the one standing with Trump when he said it, number one.\nNumber two, the idea that we're going to be in a situation where all these millions and millions, the way he talks about it, illegal aliens are coming into the country and taking away our jobs, there's a reason why we have the fastest-growing economy in the world, a reason why we have the most successful economy in the world. We're doing better than any other nation in the world.\nAnd, by the way, those 15 Nobel laureates, economists, they all said that if Trump is re-elected, we're likely to have a recession, and inflation is going to increasingly go up.\nAnd by the way, worst president in history. 159 presidential scholars voted him the worst president in the history of the United States of America.\nWe are the most admired country in the world. We're the United States of America. There's nothing beyond our capacity. We have the finest military in the history of the world. The finest in the history of the world. No one thinks we're weak. No one wants to screw around with us. Nobody. Number one.\nNumber two, the idea that we're talking about worst presidents. I wasn't joking. Look it up. Go online. 159 or 58, don't hold me the exact number, presidential historians. They've had meetings and they voted who's the worst president in American history. One through best to worst. They said he was the worst in all of American history. That's a fact. That's not conjecture. He can argue the wrong, but that's what they voted.\nThe idea that he is knowing (ph) – doing anything to deal with child care. He did very – virtually nothing to child care. We should significantly increase the child care tax credit. We should significantly increase the availability of women and men for child or single parents to be able to go back to work, and we should encourage businesses to hold – to have child care facilities.\nLook, the fact of the matter is that he's dead wrong about it. He's increased the tariff – he's increased – he will increase the taxes on middle class people. I said I'd never raise a tax on anybody making less than $400,000. I didn't.\nBut this tariff – these 10 percent tariffs, everything coming into the country, you know what the economists say? That's going to cost the average American $2,500 a year and more, because they're going to have to pay the difference in food and all the things that are very important.\nNumber two, he's in a situation where he talks about how he has not raised – he somehow helped the middle class. The middle class has been devastated by you. Now you want a new tax cut of $5 trillion over the next ten years, which is going to fundamentally bankrupt the country. You had the largest deficit of any president in American history, number one.\nNumber two, you have not, in fact, made any contact, any progress with China. We are the lowest trade deficit with China since 2010.\nFentanyl and the byproducts of fentanyl went down for a while. And I wanted to make sure we use the machinery that can detect fentanyl, these big machines that roll over everything that comes across the border, and it costs a lot of money. That was part of this deal we put together, this bipartisan deal.\nMore fentanyl machines, were able to detect drugs, more numbers of agents, more numbers of all the people at the border. And when we had that deal done, he went – he called his Republican colleagues said don't do it. It's going to hurt me politically.\nHe never argued. It's not a good bill. It's a really good bill. We need those machines. We need those machines. And we're coming down very hard in every country in Asia in terms of precursors for fentanyl. And Mexico is working with us to make sure they don't have the technology to be able to put it together. That's what we have to do. We need those machines.\nWell, first of all, I spent half my career being – being criticized being the youngest person in politics. I was the second-youngest person ever elected to the United States Senate. And now I'm the oldest. This guy's three years younger and a lot less competent. I think that just look at the record. Look what I've done. Look how I've turned around the horrible situation he left me.\nAs I said, 50 million new jobs, 800,000 manufacturing jobs, more investment in America, over millions – billions of dollars in private investment and – and enterprises that we are growing. We've – by the way, we brought an awful a lot of people – the whole idea of computer chips. We used to have 40 percent of the market. We invented those chips. And we lost it because he was sending people to cheap – to find the cheapest jobs overseas and to bring home a product.\nSo I went – I went to South Korea. I convinced Samsung to invest billions of dollars here in the United States. And then guess what? Those fabs, they call them, to – to build these chips, those fabs pay over $100,000. You don't need a college degree for them. And there's billions, about $40 billion already being invested and being built right now in the United States, creating significant jobs for Americans all over – from all over the world.\nYeah, I would. The idea that somehow we are this failing country, I never heard a president talk like this before. We – we're the envy of the world. Name me a single major country president who wouldn't trade places with the United States of America. For all our problems and all our opportunities, we're the most progressive country in the world and getting things done. We're the strongest country in the world. We're country in the world who keeps our word and everybody trusts us, all of our allies.\nAnd our – those who he cuddles up to, from Kim Jong-un who he sends love letters to, or Putin, et cetera, they don't want to screw around with us.\nYou're going to see he's six-foot-five and only 225 pounds – or 235 pounds.\nWell, you said six-four, 200.\nWell, anyway, that's – anyway, just take a look at what he says he is and take a look at what he is.\nLook, I'd be happy to have a driving contest with him. I got my handicap, which, when I was vice president, down to a 6.\nAnd by the way, I told you before I'm happy to play golf if you carry your own bag. Think you can do it?\nI was 8 handicap.\nYou are a child.\nIf you want a World War Three, let him follow (ph) and win, and let Putin say, do what you want to NATO – just do what you want.\nThere's a thing called Article Five, an attack on one is attack on all, a required response.\nThe idea – the idea – I can't think of a single major leader in the world who wouldn't trade place with what job I've done and what they've done because we are a powerful nation, we have wonderful piece (ph), because of the people, not me, because of the American people. They're capable of anything and they step up when they're needed.\nAnd right now, we're needed. We're needed to protect the world because our own safety is at stake.\nAnd again, you want to have war, just let Putin go ahead and take Kyiv, make sure they move on, see what happens in Poland, Hungary, and other places along that border. Then you have a war.\nLet's see what your numbers are when this election is over.\nLet's see. You're a whiner. When you lost the first time, you continued to appeal and appeal to courts all across the country.\nNot one single court in America said any of your claims had any merit, state or local, none.\nBut you continue to provoke this lie about somehow there's all this misrepresentation, all the stealing. There's no evidence of that at all.\nAnd I tell you what? I doubt whether you'll accept it because you're such a whiner. The idea if you lose again, you're accepting anything, you can't stand the loss. Something snapped in you when you lost the last time.\nWe've made significant progress from the debacle that was left by President Trump in his – in his last term.\nWe find ourselves in a situation where, number one, we have to make sure that we have a fair tax system. I ask anyone out there in the audience, or anyone out watching this debate, do you think the tax system is fair?\nThe fact is that I said, nobody even making under $400,000 had a single penny increasing their taxes and it will not. And if I'm reelected, that'll be the case again.\nBut this guy is – has increased your taxes because of the deficit. Number one, he's increased inflation because of the debacle he left after – when he handled the pandemic. And he finds himself in a position where he now wants to tax you more by putting a 10 percent tariff on everything comes into the United States America.\nWhat I did, when, for example, he wants to get away with – and get rid of the ability of Medicare to – for the ability to – for the – us to be able to negotiate drug prices with big pharma companies.\nWell, guess what? We got it – we got it down to 15 – excuse me, $35 for insulin instead of $400. No more than $2,000 for every senior no matter what they – how much prescription they need.\nYou know what that did? That reduced the federal deficit (ph) – debt by $160 billion over 10 years because the government doesn't have to pay the exorbitant prices.\nI'm going to make that available to every senior, all – or go longer. It's happening now, and everybody in America. He wants to get rid of that.\nWe have – I'm going to make sure we have childcare. We're going to significantly increase the credit people have for childcare. I'm going to make sure we do something about what we're doing on lead pipes and all the things that are causing health problems for people across the country.\nWe're going to continue to fight to bring down inflation and give people a break.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-debate-atlanta-georgia"}
{"Title": "Interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News", "Date": "2024-07-05", "Text": "Thank you for having me.\nIt was a bad episode. Ah, No indicated any serious condition. I was exhausted. I didn't listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and — and I had a bad night.\nBecause I was sick, I was feelin' terrible. Matter of fact, the docs with me, I asked if they did a COVID test—'cause they were trying to figure out what's wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had som-- some infection. You know, a virus. I didn't. I just had a really bad cold.\nI don't think I did, no.\nYeah, look. [pauses] The whole way I prepared—nobody's fault—mine. Nobody's fault but mine. I, uh, I prepared, what I usually would do, sittin' down as I did come back, with foreign leaders or the National Security Council, for explicit detail. And I realized—'bout partway through, that—you know, all—that--I get quoted that the New York Times had me down at ten points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is, that what I looked at is that he also lied 28 times. I couldn't—I mean, the way the debate ran—not—my fault, nobody else's fault, no one else's fault—\nWell, I just had a bad night. You've had some bad interviews once in a while, like I can't remember any, but I'm sure you did.\nYeah.\nWell, look, after that debate I did ten major events, in a row including 'til 2:00 in the morning after that debate. I did events in North Carolina. I did events in, in, in Georgia. Did events like this, today—large crowds, overwhelming response. No, no, no slipping. And so I just had a bad night. I don't know why.\nWell, it came to me that I was havin' a bad night when I realized that even when I was answering the question, even though they turned his mic off, he was still shouting. And I, I let it distract me. That--but I'm not blaming it on that. But I realized that I just wasn't in control.\nIn terms of successes, yes. I also was the guy who put together a peace plan for the Middle East that may be comin' to fruition. I was also the guy that expanded NATO. I's also the guy that grew the economy. All the individual things that were done were ideas I had or I fulfilled. I moved on.\nAnd so, for example, you know, well, well that was true then, what's Biden done lately? It's, it's, it's just today—just announced 200,000 new jobs. We're moving in a direction that no one's ever taken on. I know you know this from the days in the, in the, in the, in the government. I took on Big Pharma. I beat them. No one said I could beat them.\nI took on, all the things we said, we got done—were told we couldn't get done. And part of it is—what I said when I ran was I wanted to do three things: Restore some decency to the Office; restore some support for the middle class instead of trickle down economics, build from the middle out and the bottom up the way the wealthy still do fine everyone does better; and unite the country.\nWell. I, I, I just think it cost me a really bad night. A bad run. But--you know I, uh. --George, I have--I'm optimistic about this country. I don't think we're a country of losers that he points out. I don't think America's in tough shape. I think America is on the cusp of breaking through in so many incredible opportunities.\nIn this next term, I'm gonna make sure we gotta—straighten out the tax system. We're gonna make sure we're in a situation where we have health care for all people. Or we're in a position where we have, have child care and elder care. Free up and all these things.\nOne thing I'm proudest of, is, remember when my economic plan was put forward? A lot of the mainstream economists said it's not gonna work. Well, guess what? They now have 16 Nobel laureates, 16 of 'em, in economics, saying that Biden's next term would be sig—enor—based on what he wants to do—enormous success. Trump's plan would cause a recession, with sig, sig, sig increased inflation. I've made great progress and that's what I plan on doin'. And we can do this.\nCan I run the hundred in ten flat? No. But I'm still in good shape.\nNo.\nCome keep my schedule. [laughs]\nHe said, uh he just looked at me. He said, \"You're exhausted.\" I said—look, I have medical doctors traveling everywhere--every President does, as you know--medical doctors, some of the best in the world, travel with me everywhere I go. I have an ongoing uh, assessment of what I'm doin'. And they don't hesitate to tell me if they think there's something wrong.\nI've had a —I get a full neurological test every day--with me. And I've had a full physical. I had, you know, I mean, I've, I've been at Walter Reed [Hospital] for my physicals. I mean, uh, yes, in answer.\nNo. No one said I had to. No one said--they said I'm good.\nLook, I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test. Everything I do. You know, not only am I campaignin', but I'm runnin' the world. And, and that's not hi--sounds like hyperbole. But, we are the essential nation in the world. Madeline Albright was right.\nAnd every single day—for example, today before I come out here, I'm on the phone with the—with the Prime Minister of--I know I shouldn't get into the detail, but with Netanyahu. I'm on the phone with the new Prime Minister of England. I'm workin' on what we were doing with regard to, in Europe, with regard to expansion of NATO and whether it's goin' to stick. I'm takin' on Putin. I mean--every day--there's no day I go through, there are not those decisions I have to make every single day.\nWatch me between--there's a lotta time left in this campaign. It's over 125 days.\nTo make [or possibly \"don't make\"] the decision.\nNo, I've already done it.\nGeorge. I'm the guy that put NATO together--the future. No one thought I could expand it. I'm the guy that shut Putin down. No one thought could happen. I'm the guy that put together the South Pacific initiative with AUKUS. I'm the guy that got fifty nations, out--not only in Europe--outside of Europe as well, to help Ukraine. I'm the guy that got Japanese to expand their budget.\nI'm the--so I mean, and, the--for example, when I decided--we used to have 40% of the computer chip in--we invented the chip--of those little chips--computer chip. It's in everything from a cell phone to weapons. And so we used to have 40% of, we're down to virtually nothin'. So I get in the plane against the advice of everybody and I fly to South Korea. I convinced them to invest in the United States. Billions of dollars. Now we have tens of billions of dollars bein' invested in the United States, making us back in the position we're gonna own that industry again.\nWe have, I mean—I, I guess--anyway. I'm not—I don't wanna take too much credit, I have great staff.\nI believe--I wouldn't be runnin' if I didn't think of I did.\nLook [pauses]--I'm runnin' again because I think I understand best what has to be done. To take this nation to a completely n-, new level, we're on our way. We're on our way.\nAnd look, the decision recently made by the Supreme Court on immunity. You know, the next President of the United States, it's not just about whether he or she knows what they're doin'.\nIt's — it's — it's not, not about acon — a conglomerate of people making decisions. It's about the character of the President. The character of the President's gonna determine whether or not this Constitution is employed the right way.\nYes, I am. Because George, the last thing I wanna do is not be able to meet that. I think as some of senior economists and senior foreign policy specialists say, if I stop now, I go down in history as a pretty successful President. No one thought I could get done what we got done.\nYes! Yes, yes, yes.\nSure.\nYou guys keep saying that. George, do you--look, you know polling better than anybody. You think polling data's accurate as it used to be?\nWell, that's not unusual in some states. I carried an awful lotta Democrats last time I ran, in 2020. Look, I remember them tellin' me the same thing in 2020. I can't win, the poll show I can't win. Number 2024--2020 the red wave was coming.\nBefore the vote, I said, \"That's not gonna happen. We're gonna win.\" We did better in an off-year than almost any incumbent president ever has done. They said in 2023, all the tough races, we're not gonna win. I went into all those areas and all those, all those districts, and we won.\nWhoa, whoa, whoa.\nNot when you're running against a pathological liar. Not when he hadn't been challenged in a way that he's about to be challenged. Not when people--\nOh sure, I had months, but I was also doin' a hell of a lot of other things, like wars around the world, like keeping NATO together, like working--anyway. But look--\nI think it's--all pollsters I talk to tell me it's a toss-up. It's a toss-up. And when I'm behind, there's only one poll I'm really far behind--CBS poll and NBC. I mean, excuse me. And uh—\nThat's exactly right. New York Times had me behind before anything having to do with this race and behind behind 10 points, 10 points had me behind. Nothing's changed substantially from the debate in the New York Times poll.\nBy 7 million votes.\nI don't. I don't buy that.\nI don't think anybody's more qualified to be President or win this race than me.\nOhh come on! Well, I don't think those critics know what they're talkin' about.\nThey're just wrong! Look, Trump is a pathological liar. Trump is—he, he is—[pauses]. Have you ever seen anything Trump did that benefited som, somebody else, not him? I'm, I'm, you can't answer, I know.\nNo, I know you have. I'm not being critical. I'm not being critical. But look, I mean. [pauses]\nThe man is a congenital liar. As I said, they pointed out in that debate, he lied 27-28 times--The Times--or whatever number, over 20 times. Talk about how his good his economy was, how he brought down inflation, and how--this is a guy who, unlike only other president of other'n him is Hoover, lost more jobs than he created.\nThis's the guy told us to put bleach in our arms to deal with COVID with a million, over a million people died.\nThis is the guy who talks about wanna get rid of the healthcare provision we put in place. This is the guy who wants to give the power back to Big Pharma to be able to charge exorbitant prices for drugs. This is the guy who wants to undo every single thing I've done, every single, ev, every single thing.\nI convinced myself of two things: I'm the most qualified person to beat 'im, and I know how to get things done.\n[laughing] Well, it depends on whether the Lord Almighty comes down and tells me that, I might do that.\nWell, Mark is a good man. We've never had that--he also tried to get the nomination too. Mark's, not—Mark and I have a different perspective, I respect him.\nI, I'd go into detail with 'em, I've speaken to all of 'em in detail, including Jim Clyburn. Every one of 'em. They all said I should stay in the race. Stay in the race. No one said--none of the people said I should leave the race.\nWell, uh, it's like—[laugh] they're not gonna do that.\nWell, yeah, I'm sure. Look. I mean, if the Lord Almighty came down and said, \"Joe, get outta the race,\" I'd get outta the race. The Lord Almighty's not comin' down. I mean these hypotheticals, George—\"if.\" I mean if all--\nBut, well, they, I've met with them. I've met with a lotta these people. I've talked with them regularly. I had an hour conversation with Hakeem. I had more time than that with Jim Clyburn. I spent time with, many hours, off and on, the last little bit with Chuck Schumer. It's not like--I had all the governors. All the governors.\nI'm not gonna answer that question. It's not gonna happen.\nYou saw it today. How many f--how many people can you get--draw crowds like I drew today? You find many more enthusiastic than today? Huh?\nHe can draw a big crowd, but what's he saying? Wha? Who, who's he have? I'm the guy supposedly in trouble. We raised $38 million within four days after this. Over, we have over a million individual contributors. Individual contributors. Less, less than 200 bucks. Yeah, I mean. I've not seen what you're, you're proposing.\nI've seen it from the press.\nI say the vast majority are not with that, where those folks are. I don't doubt there's some folks there. Have you ever seen a group, a, a time when elected officials running for office aren't a little worried? Have you ever seen that? I've not. Same thing happened in 2020. \"Aww, Biden, I don't know, man, what's he gonna do? Uhh, He may bring me down. He may--.\"\nWell, I don't believe that's my approval rating. That's not what our polls show.\nI'll feel as long as I gave it my all and I did the good as job as I know I can do—that's what this is about. Look, George. Think of it this way. You've heard me say this before. I think the United States and the world is at an inflection point where the things that happen in the next several years are gonna determine what the next six, seven decades'll look like. And who's gonna be able to hold NATO together like me? Who's gonna be able to be in a position where I'm able to keep the Pacific basin in a position where we're we're at least check-mating China now? Who's gonna, who's gonna do that? Who has that reach, who has? Who knows all these pe…? We're gonna have, I guess, a, a good way to judge me is you're gonna have now the NATO conference, here in the United States next week. Come listen. See what they say.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-4"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2024-07-11", "Text": "Hey, everybody. Thank you. Please be seated.\nWell, good evening. We just concluded this year's NATO summit. And the consensus among the members was it was a great success. It was especially momentous because it represented the 75th year of the most important military defense alliance in the world's—the history of the world.\nWe should never forget that NATO grew out of the wreckage of World War II, the most destructive war in history. The idea was to create an alliance of free and democratic nations that would commit themselves to a compact of collective defense. Standing together, they knew we'd all be safer. An attack on one would be treated as an attack on all.\nAnd it's worked because a would-be aggressor knows if they attack one of us, they'll be attacked by all of us. Sending that message is the best way to deter aggression and prevent wars in the first place.\nFor those who thought NATO's time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine. Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life because, once again, a murderous madman was on the march.\nBut this time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States. We collected intelligence that Russia was planning to invade Ukraine months before the invasion. I directed the intelligence community to be—a significant amount of intelligence to be declassified so I could start building an international coalition to oppose the invasion.\nThen, in February, some of you remember, I warned the world that the invasion was imminent. I rallied a coalition of 50 nations from Europe to Asia to help Ukraine defend itself.\nMy foreign policy—many foreign policy experts thought, as Putin amassed Russian forces just 100 miles north of Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine—but he thought—he, Putin, thought it was the mother home of Russia—the capital would fall in less than a week.\nBut the Ukrainian people, backed by a coalition I helped build, stopped them. Today, Kyiv still stands. And NATO stands stronger than it has ever been.\nDuring the week of this summit, several head of states made it a point in their statements to thank the United States and to thank me personally for all that NATO has achieved. NATO is not only stronger, NATO is bigger because we led the charge to bring in Finland and Sweden into the alliance, and it makes a gigantic difference.\n[At this point, the President cleared his throat.]\nExcuse me.\nMeanwhile, my predecessor has made it clear he has no commitment to NATO. He's made it clear that he would feel no obligation to honor article 5. He's already told Putin, and I quote, \"do whatever the hell you want.\" In fact, the day after Putin invaded Ukraine, here's what he said: It was \"genius.\" It was \"wonderful.\" Some of you forgot that, but that's exactly what he said.\nBut I've made it clear, a strong NATO is essential to American security. And I believe the obligation of article 5 is sacred. And I would remind all Americans, article 5 was invoked only once in NATO's long history, and that was to defend America after 9/11.\nI made it clear that I will not bow down to Putin. I will not walk away from Ukraine. I will keep NATO strong. And that's exactly what we did and exactly what we'll continue to do.\nNow the future of American policy is up to the American people. This is much more than a political question. It's more than that. It's a national security issue.\nDon't reduce this to the usual testament that people talk about it—the issues of being a political campaign. It's far too important. It's about the world we will live in for decades to come. Every American must ask herself or himself: Is the world safer with NATO? Are you safer? Is your family safer?\nI believe the American people know the answer to all those questions is \"yes.\" And I believe the American people understand that America is stronger—stronger—because of our alliances. I believe the American consensus from Truman to Reagan to me still holds today.\nAmerica cannot retreat from the world. It must lead the world. We are an indispensable nation, as Madeleine Albright wrote.\nNow let me turn to three other key issues.\nJust this morning we had a great economic report showing inflation is down. Overall, prices fell last month. Core inflation is the lowest it's been in 3 years. Prices are falling for cars, appliances, and airfare—airfares. Grocery prices have fallen since the start of the year.\nWe're going to keep working to take down corporate greed to bring those prices down further.\nMeanwhile, Trump's calling for a 10-percent tariff on everything Americans buy, including food from overseas, vegetables, and other necessities. And economists tell us that that would cost the average American working family another $2,500 a year. It's a tax of $2,500 a year.\nSecond, our efforts to secure the border—our southern border is working. After Trump killed the bipartisan effort to secure the border—Republicans and Democrats had worked on—because he thought it would benefit me and make him a loser, Republicans walked away. So I took executive action last month.\nAs a consequence, working with Mexico, border encounters have gone down over 50 percent. The current level is lower today than when Trump left office.\nThird, for months, the United States has been working to secure a cease-fire in Gaza, to bring the hostages home, to create a path for peace and stability in the Middle East.\nSix weeks ago, I laid out a detailed plan in writing. It was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, the G-7. That framework is now agreed on by both Israel and Hamas. So I sent my team to the region to hammer out the details.\nThese are difficult, complex issues. There are still gaps to close, but we're making progress, the trend is positive, and I'm determined to get this deal done and bring an end to this war, which should end now.\nLet me conclude where I began. We're the United States of America. We are the indispensable nation. Our leadership matters. Our partnerships matter. This moment matters. We must rise to meet it.\nWith that, I'll take your questions. I've been given a list of people to call on here.\nReuters, Jeff Mason.\nUAW just endorsed me. But go ahead.\nLook, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump [Harris; White House correction] to be Vice President did I think she was not qualified to be President. So let's start there. Number one.\nThe fact is that—the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for President. I beat him once, and I will beat him again.\nSecondly, the idea—I served in the Senate a long time. The idea that Senators and Congressmen running for office worry about the ticket is not unusual.\nAnd I might add, there were at least five Presidents running or incumbent Presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in the campaign. So there's a long way to go in this campaign.\nAnd so I'm just going to keep moving. Keep moving and—because, look, I've got more work to do. We've got more work to finish. There's so much—we've made so much progress. Think about it.\nThink about where we are economically relative to the rest of the world. Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. We've created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, 1.5 million jobs—I mean, so things are moving.\nWe've got more to go. Working class people still have—need help. Corporate greed is still at large. There are—prices—the corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic. They're coming down.\nAnd so I'm optimistic about where things are going.\nDanny Kemp, AFP.\nDid you see any damage to our standing in my leading this conference? Have you seen a more successful conference? What do you think?\nAnd the move—the Putin piece, I was talking about Putin, and I said, \"And now\"—at the very end, I said, \"Here\"—I mean, \"Putin.\" And I said: \"Oh, no. I'm sorry, Zelenskyy.\" And then I added five other names.\nLook, guys, the idea anybody suggests that we haven't had an incredibly successful conference—how many times did you hear in that conference—I know it sounds too self-serving—but other leaders, heads of state, in thanking me saying, \"The reason we're together is because of Biden, because Biden did the following.\"\nLook, folks, this is a—well, anyway. I thought it was the most successful conference I've attended in a long time. And find me a world leader who didn't think it was.\nNext one. Sorry. Nancy Cordes, CBS.\nWell, look, I'm not in this for my legacy, I'm in this to complete the job I started.\nAs you'll recall, understandably, many of you and many economists thought my initial initiatives that I put forward—\"Can't do that. It's going to cause inflation. Things are going to skyrocket. The debt's going to go up.\"\nWhat are you hearing now from mainstream economists? Sixteen economic Nobel laureates said I've done a hell of a job, that under my plans so far and what's going to happen in the future if I'm reelected, that things are going to get much better. Our economy is growing.\nI was determined when I got elected to stop the trickle-down economic theory that if the wealthy did very well, everybody else would do well. My dad was a well-read and decent guy. I don't remember much trickling down on his kitchen table.\nMiddle class people and working class people need help. And so what happened is, I decided to implement—was able to implement as President what I believed when I was a Senator. And that is that the way to build this economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. That way, we grow the economy, and the wealthy still do very well. They do fine.\nAnd guess what? Find me an economist—a mainstream economist who said we haven't done well. What have we not done that isn't working right now? And so we've got more to do though. We've got to finish the job.\nAnd by the way, I come from the corporate State of the world. Delaware has more corporations than and—you know, registered in Delaware than every other State in the Nation combined.\nI'm not anticorporate. But corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic—doubled. It's time things get back in order a little bit. It's time—for example, if I'm reelected, we're going to make sure that rents are kept at 5-percent increase, corporate rents for apartments and the like and homes are limited to 5 percent.\nWe're going to make a lot of changes that I've been talking about, because we're going to continue to grow this economy.\nAnd by the way, I know—remember how I got so roundly criticized for being so pro-union—not labor—union—union? Well, guess what? I've been the most pro-union labor President in history. Not a joke.\nAnd guess what? We had the Treasury Department do a study. When unions do better, everybody does better. Everybody does better.\nAnd we talk about how, for example—and when I went—remember when we talked about getting the computer chip industry back in the United States? Used to be 40 percent of the industry. We invented the chip. Forty percent of the industry was in the United States.\nAnd former Presidents decided that the best way to do it is find the cheapest labor in the world, send the product over there, and import what the product was.\nAnd so what did I do? I was told not to go over to Europe—I mean, to Asia—including Europe, but Asia. And I remember going to South Korea, convincing them to invest $20 billion in the United States to build computer chip factories. And I asked why, when they finally decided to do it. And the answer was: Because you have the safest economy in the world and you have the best workers in the world.\nSo the whole idea here is, we've invested—there's over $50 billion in investment in computer chip manufacturing just coming into being. None of you thought that would happen. None of you thought that would happen. But it's happening. It's happening.\nAnd that's going to grow economies all through—and by the way, red States and blue States—matter of fact, there's as much in red States as in blue States. I've made no distinction.\nSo my generic point is that the idea that we can't continue to build and grow the economy, make it fairer—and like I said, from my standpoint, when the middle class does well, that's when the whole economy grows. The poor have a shot; the wealthy do well. But the wealthy got to start paying their taxes.\nFirst of all, the way she's handled the issue of freedom of women's bodies—to have control over their bodies.\nSecondly, her ability to handle almost any issue on the board. This was a hell of a prosecutor. She was a first-rate person in—and in the Senate, she was really good.\nI wouldn't have picked her unless I thought she was qualified to be President from the very beginning. I made no bones about that. She is qualified to be President. That's why I picked her.\nFelicia Schwartz, Financial Times.\nThe limits I've acknowledged I have?\nThat's not true. Look—[laughter]—what I said was: Instead of my every day starting at 7 and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. And I said—for example, the 8, 7, 6 stuff—instead of starting a fundraiser at 9 o'clock, start at 8 o'clock. People get to go home by 10 o'clock. That's what I'm talking about.\nI'm not talking about—and if you looked at my schedule since I've—since I made that stupid mistake of—in the campaign—in the debate, I mean, my schedule has been full bore. I've done—where's—and where's Trump been? Riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball?\nI mean, look, he's done virtually nothing. And I have—I don't know how many—I've—don't hold me to it—roughly 20 major events, some of them with thousands of people showing up.\nAnd so I just think it's better. I always have an inclination, whether I was playing sports or doing politics, just to keep going, not stop. I've just got to just pace myself a little more—pace myself.\nAnd the next debate, I'm not going to be traveling into 15 time zones a week before. [Laughter] Anyway, that's what it was about. That's what it was about.\nAnd by the way, even with that, I love my staff, but they add things. They add things all the time at the very end. I'm catching hell from my wife for that. Anyway.\nI'm sorry. Zeke Miller, Associated Press.\nThe first thing about Zelenskyy asking for the ability to strike deep into Russia: We have allowed Zelenskyy to use American weapons in the near term, in the near abroad, into Russia. Whether or not he has—we should be—he should be attacked—for example, should Zelenskyy—he's not, but if he had the capacity to strike Moscow, strike the Kremlin, would that make sense? It wouldn't.\nThe question is: What's the best use of the weaponry he has and the weaponry we're getting to him? I've gotten him more HIMAR—I got him more long-range capacity as well as defensive capacity.\nAnd so our military is working—I'm following the advice of my commander in chief—my—of the—the Chief of Staff of the military as well as the Secretary of Defense and our intelligence people. And we're making a day-to-day basis on what they should and shouldn't go—how far they should go in. That's a logical thing to do.\nWell, I tell you what, the best way to assure them is the way I assure myself, and that is: Am I getting the job done? Am I getting the job done?\nCan you name me somebody who's gotten more major pieces of legislation passed in 3½ years? I got—I created 2,000 jobs just last week. So, if I slow down and I can't get the job done, that's a sign that I shouldn't be doing it. But there's no indication of that yet. None.\nWho do we got here? Marek [Walkuski], Polskie Radio.\nI'm well.\n2024 Presidential Election/North Atlantic Treaty Organization/U.S. Foreign Policy\nThey're correct.\nWell, look, I think—how can I say this without sounding too self-serving? I'm not having any of my European allies come up to me and say, \"Joe, don't run.\" What I hear them say is: \"You've got to win. You can't let this guy come forward. He'd be a disaster. He'd be a disaster.\"\nI mean, I think he said at one of his rallies—don't hold me to this—recently where NATO—\"I just learned about NATO\" or something to that effect.\nForeign policy has never been his strong point. And he seems to have an affinity to people who are authoritarian. That worries—as I don't tell you, from Poland—that worries Europe. That worries Poland. And nobody, including the people of Poland, think that if he wins in Ukraine, he's going to stop in Ukraine, that that's going to be the end of it.\nAnd so what I can say is, I think I am the best qualified person to do the job, to make sure that Ukraine is not fall—that Ukraine succeeds, that the European alliance stays strong.\nYou may recall, no one was talking about Finland joining NATO. I remember talking to Putin in—when—right after we got elected, in Geneva. And he was talking about what we should do—he—what we couldn't have—be in Eastern Europe, et cetera. And I said, \"You're looking for the Finlandization of Ukraine.\" I said, \"You're going to get to NATOization of Finland.\"\nAnd about 4 weeks later, I got a call—that—that's not true—probably 5 months later—from the President of Finland, could he come and see me. Because—in my office, I had—I invited him to the Oval Office. We sat down and talked. He said he wanted to join NATO, could I help. And I did. It wasn't automatic.\nAnd then I got a call from the Swedes.\n[A laptop computer played audio.]\nI beg your pardon?\nAnd so Finland joined NATO. Eight-hundred-mile border, it's a significant—and they were already allies, but they weren't part of NATO.\nAnd you heard—I think you heard—maybe—I can't recall if he said it publicly or in our—in a closed meeting, but he wouldn't mind it being repeated. He said, \"We decided in Finland—the people of Finland decided they had to be part of NATO. It was in our interest, because of the joint ability to be together, to dissuade any attack on Finland. And the same thing with Sweden. It took a lot of selling to some folks, particularly in Turkey and other places, to agree to the expansion.\nBut it expanded, and we're a hell of a lot stronger because of it. We're more secure because of it.\nAnd by the way, I was able to get 50 other nations—50—five-zero—to support Ukraine. Fifty. And we were able to bring about a coalition between—in—of Europe and Asia—Japan and South Korea.\nI just met with—we've talked about AUKUS, and we talked about the relationship between Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, the United States. We're making the world safer and stronger, because we have to deal with a new arrangement that exists in the world.\nThe cold war is over. The postwar era is over. What is going to replace it? And I respectfully suggest, I have a pretty good idea of what that should be. I've convinced a lot of people to follow it, and we're just going to get stronger.\nDavid Sanger [New York Times]. Where is——\nBe nice, David. [Laughter]\nWell, the first part of your question is, we discussed and I raised in the NATO summit—and others raised—the future of China's involvement, what they're going to do—what they're doing with Russia, in terms of accommodating, facilitating. They're getting access to additional—they're not supplying—they're not supplying weapons themselves; they're supplying mechanisms for them to be able to get weapons.\nAnd China's position is basically—and I've spent more time with Xi Jinping than any world leader has—over 90 hours since being Vice President and all the way through. For real. And by the way, I handed in all my notes.\nBut my point is that Xi believes that China is a large enough market that they can entice any country, including European countries, to invest there in return for commitments to—from Europe to do A, B, C, or D, or not to do certain things.\nWhat's happened is, we had a long discussion about what we cannot—we have to make clear, China has to understand that if they are supplying Russia with information and capacity, along with working with North Korea and others to help Russia in armament, that they're not going to benefit economically as a consequence of that—by getting the kind of investment they're looking for.\nAnd so, for example, we're in a situation where when—and we've reestablished direct contact with China after that—remember the \"balloon,\" quote, unquote, going down and, all of a sudden, the thing came to an end? Well, we set up a new mechanism. There's a direct line between Xi and me, and our military has direct access to one another, and they contact one another when we have problems.\nThe issue is that we have to make sure that Xi understands there's a price to pay for undercutting both the Pacific Basin, as well as Europe, and as relates to Russia and dealing with Ukraine.\nAnd so we—for example, if you want to invest in China, as you know—you know this area really well. If you want to invest in China, you have to—you have a 51-percent Chinese owner; you have to make sure that you do it by their rules; and you can't—you don't have the authority—and you have to provide all access to all the data and information you have.\nThere was a while there, as you recall, in the last administration and other administrations, where the access to that market was enticive [enticing; White House correction] enough to get companies to come in because they had access to over a billion people in the market—a market—not a billion, but a lot of people in the market. And so they were doing it.\nBut that curtailed—that got curtailed when we started saying we're going to play by the same rules. For example, the idea they don't abide by the international rules related to subsidizing products by the Government funding. So guess what? They're not going to be able to export their electric vehicles to the United States without a significant tariff. Others are doing the same thing around the world.\nBut it is a concern. It is a concern that you have both China, South Korea—I mean, North Korea, Russia, Iran—countries that are not necessarily coordinated in the past—looking to figure out how they can have impact.\nYes, I do, but I'm not prepared to talk about the detail of it in public.\nAnd I think you'll see that some of our European friends are going to be curtailing their involve—investment in Russia—I mean, in—excuse me, in China, as long as China continues to have this indirect help to Russia, in terms of being able to help their economy as well as—as well as—help them in—as a consequence that their ability to fight in Ukraine.\nThe other thing that we talked a lot about is that—and I raised it, and there was—I didn't hear any—I can't swear that everyone agreed, because not everybody got to talk about it. But we haven't—we need a new industrial policy in the West. For example, we talked about how both the EU, as well as NATO, has to be able to begin to build their own munition capacity, has to be able to generate their own capacity to provide for weapons and the ability to—it came as a surprise to some of us how we had fallen behind in the West in terms of the ability to construct new materiel, new weaponry, and new—everything from vehicles to weapon systems.\nAnd so one of the things that came out of this was—we're going to be meeting again with a number of my colleagues—my European colleagues—is: What do we do to increase the capacity of the West, and particularly in Europe, and Japan to be able to generate the kind of ability to produce their own weapons systems—not just for themselves, but to be able to generate that?\nIt's the same—this is—that's what Russia is trying to figure out. They went to China, and they didn't get the weapons, but then they went to North Korea.\nBut we're going to be in a position where the West is going to become the industrial base for it to be able to build—the ability to have all the defensive weapons that we need. That was a discussion as well.\nI'm ready to deal with them now and 3 years from now. Look, the—like I said, I'm dealing with Xi right now, in direct contact with him. I have no good reason to talk to Putin right now. There's not much that he is prepared to do in terms of accommodating any change in his behavior.\nAnd—but there isn't any world leader I'm not prepared to deal with. But I understand the generic point is: Is Putin ready to talk? I'm not ready to talk to Putin unless Putin is ready to change his behavior.\nAnd the idea—look, Putin has got a problem. First of all, in this war that he has—supposedly had won—and by the way, I think—don't hold me to the exact number, but I think that Russia had 17.3 percent of Ukraine that they've conquered. Now it's 17.4—I mean, in terms of percentage of territory.\nThey've not been very successful. They've called horrible damage and loss of life. But they've also lost over 350,000 troops, military—killed or wounded. They have over a million people, particularly young people with technical capability, leaving Russia because they see no future there. They've got a problem.\nBut what they do have control of is, they are very good at controlling and running the public outcry that relates to how they use mechanisms to communicate with people. They lie like hell to their constituencies. They lie like hell about what's going on.\nAnd so the idea that we're going to be able to fundamentally change Russia in the near term is not likely. But one thing for certain: If we allow Russia to succeed in Ukraine, they're not stopping at Ukraine.\nI recommend—I know you know this because you've written about it—read Putin's speech after they moved in. What it was all about—in Kyiv—it wasn't about just—anyway, read what his objective is.\nAnd anyway, but—so I think that I'm prepared to talk to any leader who wants to talk, including if Putin called me and he wanted to talk. Last time I talked to Putin was trying to get him to work on an arms control agreement related to nuclear weapons in space. That didn't go very far.\nSo my point is, I'm prepared to talk to anybody, but I don't see any inclination. There is an inclination on the part of the Chinese to keep in contact with me, because they're not sure where this all goes.\nAnd look what's happened in Asia. We have strengthened the Asian-Pacific area more than anyone else has. We—you know, we just put together with—today, we had—we—I brought on—I asked the—our NATO allies that we bring on the group from the South Pacific: Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Australia—I already mentioned Australia.\nAnd I met twice now, I think, with the 14 leaders of the Pacific Island nations, and we've slowed down what's going on there. We've slowed down China's reach.\nBut there's a lot of work to do. This is a moving target. And I don't take it lightly.\nAsam [Asma; White House correction] from NPR.\nTwo things. Let's go back to when you talked about would I have changed anything that's happening with Israel and the Palestinians and the Palestinian movement.\nThe answer is, as you recall, from the very beginning, I immediately—I went to Israel, but I also got in immediate contact Elsisi in Egypt. I met with the King of Jordan. I met with—I met with most of the Arab leaders to try to get a consensus going as to what had to be done to deal with getting more aid and food and medicine into the Gaza Strip.\nAnd we pushed it really hard. And Israel occasionally was less than cooperative. Number one.\nThe Israeli war cabinet I've been—I've been dealing with Israel since Golda Meir. I've—some—some of the reporters around here who cover me all the time have heard me say this: The last—first time I met with Golda Meir, I sat near—across from her and her desk, and her assistant was Rabin, sitting next to me. That's how far back I go.\nI know Israel well, and I support Israel. But this war cabinet is one of the most conservative war cabinets in the history of Israel. And there's no ultimate answer other than a two-state solution here.\nAnd so what was able to be done in terms of the organization—the plan I put together was, it would be a process for a two-state solution. And we get the Arab nations to—particularly from Egypt all the way to Saudi Arabia to be in a position where they would cooperate in the transition so that they could keep the peace in Gaza without Israeli forces staying in Gaza.\nThe question has been from the beginning: What's the day after in Gaza? And the day after in Gaza has to be—the end of the day after it has to be no occupation by Israel on the Gaza Strip, as well as the ability for us to access—get in and out, as rapidly as you can, all that's needed there.\nI've been disappointed that some of the things that I've put forward have not succeeded as well, like the port we attached from Cyprus. I was hopeful that would be more successful.\nBut that's why I'm—when I went to Israel after—immediately after the massacres that occurred at the hands of Hamas, that I—the one thing I said to the Israelis, and I met with the war cabinet and with Bibi: Don't make the same mistake America made after bin Laden. There's no need to occupy anywhere. Go after the people who did the job.\nYou may recall, I get—still get criticized for it, but I was totally opposed to the occupation and trying to unite Afghanistan. Once we got—once we got bin Laden, we should have moved on because it was not in our—no one is ever going to unite it—unite that country.\nI've been over every inch of that—not every inch—of the entirety, from the poppy fields, all the way to the north. I said: \"Don't make the same mistake we made. Don't think that's what you should be doing is doubling down. We'll help you find the bad guys, Sinwar and company.\"\nAnd I—and all this criticism about I wouldn't provide—when the weapons they needed. I am not providing them 2,000-pound bombs. They cannot be used in Gaza or any populated area without causing great human tragedy and damage.\nBut we're—remember what happened when you had the attack on Israel from—with rockets and ballistic missiles? I was able to unite the Arab nations as well as—as well as Europe, and nothing happened. Nothing got hurt. It sent—it sent an incredible lesson to what was going on from the Middle East.\nSo there's a lot of things that, in retrospect, I wish I had been able to convince the Israelis to do. But the bottom line is, we have a chance now. It's time to end this war. It doesn't mean walk away from going after Sinwar and Hamas.\nAnd if you notice—you know better than most—there is a lot—a growing dissatisfaction in the—on the West Bank, from the Palestinians about Hamas. Hamas is not popular now.\nAnd so there's a lot of moving parts. I just have to keep making—moving to make sure that we get as much done as we can toward a cease-fire—a cease-fire—and get those—and by the way, look at the numbers in Israel. I mean, I—my numbers are better in Israel than they are here. But, then again, they're better than a lot of other people here too.\nWhat changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy, and domestic division.\nAnd I think—I won't put words in anybody's mouth. Most Presidential historians give me credit for having accomplished more than most any President since Johnson and maybe before that to get major pieces of legislation passed.\nAnd what I realized was, my long time in the Senate had equipped me to have the wisdom to know how to deal with the Congress to get things done. We got more major legislation passed that no one thought would happen.\nAnd I want to finish it—to get that finished. If tomorrow—if you said—if we had a circumstance wherever—there was a lineup, and I didn't—hadn't inherited what I did and we just moved things along—anyway, it's going to change.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Last question.\nHaley Bull, Scripps—or, no. Josh Wingrove [Bloomberg]—I'm sorry. It was the next one. I'll do two more questions then.\nAm I using it that way, you said?\nI'm determined on running, but I think it's important that I relay—I allay fears by seeing—let them see me out there. Let me see them out—you know, for the longest time it was, you know: \"Biden is not prepared to sit with us unscripted. Biden is not prepared to\"—you know, anyway.\nAnd so what I'm doing, and it's what I've been doing—I think we've done over 20 major events, from Wisconsin to North Carolina to—anyway—to demonstrate that I'm going out in the areas where we think we can win, where we can persuade people to move our way or people are already there.\nAnd here, look, the other thing is, we have the most extensive campaign organization that anybody has had in a long, long time. We have well over a thousand volunteers knocking on doors, making phone calls, making tens of thousands of phone calls. We have headquarters—I forget exactly how many. I don't want to cite a number and then find out I'm off. But we have scores of headquarters in all the toss-up States. We're organized. We're moving.\nAnd I—that's awful hard to replace in the near term.\nAnd so—and here's the other thing: I was in the Senate a long time. Very proud of what I've done in the Senate. I was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for a long time, and I was chairman of—or ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I'm going to be going down to the Johnson Library on—anyway, I'm going to be going around making the case of things that I think we have to finish and how we can't afford to lose what we've done or backslide on civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights. The—that little button we have: \"Control guns, not girls.\"\nI mean, the idea that we're seeing around—this is where Kamala is so good as well—we're sitting around—more children are killed with a—by a bullet than any other cause of death. The United States of America. What the hell are we doing? What are we doing? We've got a candidate saying—promised the NRA: \"Don't worry. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not going to do anything.\" We've got a Supreme Court that is—what you might call the most conservative Court in American history.\nThis is ridiculous. There's so much we can do still, and I'm determined to get it done. It's about freedom.\nAnd by the way—I'll end this—well, I—well, I'm going—not going to do that. Haley has to come up too.\nBut the—I remember I made a speech on democracy in Philadelphia, in Independence Hall. And—I'm not being critical, just observing—the bulk of the press said, \"What the hell is he talking about that for?\" Democracy—yes, you did. \"Democracy is not an issue.\" \"Democracy is not an issue.\"\nExcept the polling data showed 60 percent of the people knew I was right, thought I was right.\nI'm not asking you a question; you don't have to answer, obviously. But do you think our democracy is under siege based on this Court? Do you think democracy is under siege based on Project 2025?\nDo you think he means what he says when he says he's going to do away with the civil service, eliminate the Department of Education, make sure—I mean, there's—we've never been here before.\nAnd that's the other reason why I didn't, as you say, hand off to another generation. I've got to finish this job. I've got to finish this job, because there's so much at stake.\nWell, look, two things. One, I've taken three significant and intense neurological exams by the neurologic—by a neurosurgeon—a neurologist. In each case—as recently as February, and they say I'm in good shape. Okay?\nAlthough I do have a little problem with my left foot because it's not as sensitive, because I broke my foot and didn't wear the boot. But I'm good.\nI'm tested every single day about my neurological capacity—the decisions I make every day.\nYou've talked to my staff. All of you talked to my staff. Sometimes, my staff talks a lot. [Laughter] But the fact of the matter is, I don't think you have them telling you that all the major ideas we've undertaken haven't been in part initiated by me.\nI remember when the staff—and I said, \"I'm going to go to South Korea, and we're going to get the chip.\" And: \"What are you doing?\" \"I'm going to get Japan and Korea back together again after no—essentially having hostilities toward one another since the end of World War II. I'm going to move and see that we can expand\"—you know, the only thing age does is help you with a—it creates a little bit of wisdom if you pay attention.\nAnd so the point I'm making is, I think it's important that I—if my—if the neurologist tells me he thinks I need another exam—and by the way, I've laid every bit of the record out. I haven't done—hadn't hidden—hadn't hidden—hidden a thing.\nYou ought to ask Trump for his, okay?\nI've—I've laid it all out.\nAnd every single day, I'm surrounded by good docs. If they think there's a problem, I promise you—or even if they don't think it's a problem—they think I should have a neurological exam again, I'll do it. But no one is suggesting that to me now.\nAnd I'll ask you another question. No matter what I did, no one is going to be satisfied. \"Did you have seven docs? Did you have two? Who did you have? Did you do this? How many times have you\"—so I am not opposed. If my doctors tell me they should—I should have another neurological exam, I'll do it. But that's where I am.\nHaley Bull, Scripps.\nObviously, they're free to do whatever they want, but they—I get overwhelming support. Overwhelming support. I won how—I forget how many votes I won in the primary. The overwhelming—and so tomorrow, if all of a sudden, I show up at a convention and everybody says, \"We want somebody else,\" that's the democratic process. It's not going to happen.\nSure.\nLook, I'll end this with this. I served in the Senate a long time. I understand the impetus of candidates running for local office and whether they think the top—if they can help them or not.\nIn my State of Delaware, which was a very—at least a purple—it was a red State when I started, in terms of where you now talk \"red\" and \"blue.\"\nI don't recall most of the Democratic Presidents winning my State when I was a candidate. The truth of the matter is I understand the self-interest of any candidate. If they think that, you know, running with Biden at the top of the ticket is going to hurt them, then they're going to run away. I get it.\nBut, so far, go and look at the polling data in their States. Look at the in depth—and by the way, I think you'd all acknowledge—and you're all experts; I'm not being solicitous about the press, you're experts on this stuff—how accurate does anybody think the polls are these days? I can give you a series of polls where you have likely voters, me versus Trump, where I win all the time. When the unlikely voters vote, he wins sometimes.\nSo, bottom line is, all the polling data right now, which I think is premature, because the campaign really hasn't even started. I mean, it hasn't started in earnest yet. Most of the time, it doesn't start until after September—after Labor Day. So a lot can happen.\nBut I think I'm the best qualified—I know—I believe I'm the best qualified to govern. And I think I'm the best qualified to win. But there are other people who could beat Trump too. But it's awful to start from scratch.\nAnd you know, we talk about, you know, money raised. We're not doing bad. We've got about $220 million in the bank. And we're doing well.\nSo, with that, you have any—want to follow up on any of that you just asked me?\nYes.\nNo, unless they came back and said, \"There's no way you can win.\" Me. No one is saying that. No poll says that.\nOkay. Thank——\n[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre. This ends tonight's press conference. Thanks everybody.\n[Several reporters asked questions at once.]\nListen to him. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1271"}

I mean look. Everybody said, and I said we gotta tone down the rhetoric about violence. There's no room for violence. You can't be talking about violence. You can't be sayin’ that, uh, if I lose the election, there'll be a bloodbath, which he says. If we, the January 6th folks were good folks and that they should be released from prison, et cetera. What we have—there are serious, serious differences we have with the issues of the future of the country. And I'm gonna take ‘em on, directly.\nWell it says to me that he's decided that MAGA Republican politics is gonna be the future of Republican Party. And because JD is a great guy, a hard workin’ Senator, but really, really, really conservative MAGA Republican.\nWell, look. One of the things that occurred when I won—and you may remember—I said I was running for three reasons. After my son was killed, uh, died because of Iraq and I didn't want to get involved. And then, uh, I was watchin’ television and I, I was a professor at Penn, was watching television later.\nAnd you saw those folks come out of the fields in Charlottesville carrying torches, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan, carryin’ Nazi swastikas and the young woman was a bystander—was killed.\nAnd he [President Trump] was asked, \"Well, tell me about what, what happened, Mr. President.\" Said there were good people on both sides. That's when I decided I had to run. That's why I ran.\nAnd I said when I ran, I was gonna try to do 3 thrings [sic], 3 things, and I meant that sincerely: Restore the soul of America, the decency and honor which we, we we usually debate. Secondly, build the middle class from a—build out the middle class. And when that works, the bottom does well and the wealthy still does fine. And third, try to unite the country.\nAnd I was told I couldn't get any of that done. And then I had four major, major, major initiatives that they said could never pass. Bill passed. And so we're making progress. We have the most advanced economy in the world today. We got more to do.\nBut it's—and all of it, he says, all of it is, just should be, if he's elected, he's gonna get rid of. And it's not even—we haven't talked about foreign policy. And I know that's not on top of most people's minds. But, he wants to get out of NATO, he wants to yield to Putin. He wants, I mean, he has a very different view of the world than I do.\nAnd so if I have some medical condition that emerged. If somebody, if the doctors came to me and said you got this problem that problem.\nBut, I made a serious mistake. I'm in the, in the whole debate. And, uh, and look, when I originally ran you may remember it, I said I was gonna be a transitional candidate. And I thought that I'd be able to move from this, just pass it on to someone else.\nBut I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided. And quite frankly, and I think, the only thing uh age brings a little bit of wisdom. And I think I've demonstrated that I know how to get things done for the country, in spite of the fact we told we couldn't get it done. But there's more to do and I'd be reluctant to walk away from that.\nWell look only if I was told that there was some medical condition that I ah—and that's not the case. So—but I understand what people say. Look, look, I'm only three years older than Trump, OK? [laughs] And I'm at—I think I'm a little better physical shape than he is. The point is, though, that it's not unreasonable for people to say, wait a minute, you're 81 years old. And so I, I think it's a legitimate thing for ‘em to raise, and as long as I can demonstrate that it's not affecting my ability to com—compete, my ability to get things done, my ability to literally lead the world. Lead the world.\nWell’s a practical matter, yes, but there's no reason to believe that’s likely to happen.\nWell, I tell ‘em what's happening is inflation is comin’ down. And it is comin’ down. You have 16 Nobel laureates in economics saying that it's comin’ down. I think you're gonna see—I, I have not spoken to the Fed. My guess is they're gonna reduce rates.\nBut what we have to do is deal with the corporate greed. What's happened here is, since the pandemic, corporate profits have doubled. For example, I wanna make sure that you can't have corporations that own apartment complexes, cannot raise rent beyond 5—25, five percent in any one year. Period. Period.\nI wanna see to it that they have—we're gonna build 20, uh, 20 million new homes that are affordable. That's why I'm moving to make sure that we provide first time home buyers, particularly in African American communities and minority communities down payments of $10,000 to get started. That's why I've forgiven student debt—people who have met the requirement of paying off for 10 years and still have extreme debt, but they're, when they're involved in an enterprise that is where they’re a teacher or firefighter, police officer, et cetera, that debt is forgiven. And it's changing people's lives. It's changing people's lives!\nWell, uh, I think it's resonated for those who have been affected. There's about 4 million people so far, and, uh because the Republican Party and the MAGA Republicans have been opposed to it. And they've been beating up, beating up on it. I think that there's a, look, a lot of what we've done, Ed, for example, the infrastructure bill. Fancy words for making sure we have better roads, highways, bridges—take all the lead pipes out of our, out of our how-hobes [sic] and make sure there's access to affordable internet just like in, in Roosevelt’s time, you know, back in, er-earlier than that. Making sure there was electricity and agriculture in the rural areas.\nThat's all—it takes time for it to happen. And, and so it, it, it's just taking time for people to see it. And the other thing is, ah, there's not been a very good job done about saying this new billion dollar bridge going over the, is brought to you by Joe Biden. This billion dollar tunnel is gonna increase and reduce—blah blah blah, and plus —so we're working on that and I think, uh, bit I think it's just time.\nWell, let me put it this way. They may play the long game, but they don't do much. Look what they've done. Last Administration had us in a recession when they left. Last Administration, Black unemployment was down, and last Administration because of the failure to deal with COVID in an hon-honest way, a million people died. Last Administration we, we had the largest deficit of anyone in history—any, any one-term President. You know, there's only two presidents in American history who’ve come to office and left with fewer jobs than they came to office, and the other was a guy who we all know very well. Uh, So I, uh I call—anyway. Trump is one of ‘em.\nThe Supreme Court did it. Trump appointed the Supreme Court with the express purpose of doing it. So, that's the way it works.\nWell, there're gonna probably be two more appointments—to the Court. There's probably two people gonna resign or resign. Retire. Just imagine if court—if he has two more appointments on that, what that means forever.\nAnd look, one of the things that's happening is—in almost, in the majority of the states, even conservative states where it's been left to the public to determine whether or not they wanna have no exceptions, they wanna have a hard call like, like Mance [sic. Vance] wants on “no abortion under any circumstance,” that there's, you have states saying no, no, no, that's not what we want to do. We want exceptions. So I think there is a—an ability—and the way we're gonna change it, if we get a Democratic Congress, all we gotta do is get 51 of those members of the House and Senate—a lot of the Senate—and say “this is it.” And then I'll sign that bill. What, what's gonna happen? Trump's gonna sign a bill if he gets elected, if we don't do well, that's gonna say we wipe it all on, no exceptions, nothing. None.\nAnd so it's uh, it’s about—it's a little bit like George Floyd, what happened. You know, I hadda take independent action that wasn't as uh, as strong as you, what I wanted the George Floyd legislation to be. And with the legis—I couldn't get Republican votes. So we got to ca—point out what's the stake and what the MAGA Republicans are trying to do.\nI stand in the breach by making it clear we’re not gonna let that happen. For example, if you look at what happened with George Floyd. We didn't get the legislation, so I took executive action, made sure these guys gotta wear cameras and everybody has a comp—they, they—everything's on, it's it's changed. It's changed the way things have not, what we should have, as far as it should change, but it's changed things. We're also in a situation where if you take a look at what we've done in terms of the number of police officers, or, you know, most, most cops are, are killed, reports are responding to domestic violence and that. So we don't need more cops. What we need is more social workers. We need more people who are in communities building coalitions that's growing across the country. That's growing in neighborhoods. That's growing.\nAnd we have to keep doing it. aAs we, after—we need another 100,000 community police officers working with communities and bringing people in who are social workers, so people who are people who know how to put neighbors to neighbors together. Or we're doing things like what we're changing in, in, in the environmental stuff, so many, so many Black neighbors are ripped apart by highninty, by high, by interstate highways running through the middle of their community, spilling [sic] them up. But we're, we're providing the money to be able to pave over that now, not pave over, but bill, build, turn ‘em inna tunnels, ta, ta bring their neighbors together again.\nBut the other thing we've, ah [coughs] done is making clear that when I got elected, I said I was gonna have an administration look like America. I had more African Americans with high positions in my admi—not just the Vice-President, not just Supreme Court Justice, but across the board—than any administration in history. It's important that that kid in 10th grade looks up and says I can do that. I can do that. It's important that people know that they're respected. Know that they're taken care of. Know that they're engaged. That's why I appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson. She's, by the way, the brightest of the Court, I think. I mean, in terms of pure, pure gray matter. But, so, we're gonna change this, but it's gonna take time. We got to stay at it.\nLook, take a look at what's your, your bottom line is in your economy now. Take a look how those unemployment’s the lowest it’s been there. Take a look at how many of you, you, the new jobs are created. Take a look at how many people are been able to get to college education and get the debt wiped out. Take a look at what's actually happening on the ground. Take a look at the fight that's going on.\nI mean, for example, I got a lotta heat because you have our friends in the Republican Party trying to erase Black history. Well, guess what, I, I've set up a new Juneteenth, a new federal holiday. They can't erase it anymore. Everybody now knows what happened, then—\n—they are, and that's why we gotta make sure that he doesn't get elected. Trump's project 2025 says do away with the Department of Education. Leave it up to local schools. What's he talking about? What's he talking about? He's talking about trying to erase it.\nNot just affirmative action, but all efforts to right the ships for people, give people a chance.\nLook—my dad used to say that, uh, my job’s about a lot more than your paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about your integrity. It's about being a look your kid in the eye, “Honey, everything gonna be OK,” and meaning there's a shot of it. We're moving there. And by the way, the way you get equity, you build equity by home ownership, that's how all middle class white guys did it. That's how my Dad was able to do it. You buy a home, you build an equity in the home, you're able to move from there. That's happening. That's happening, but we're gonna focus on housing, significantly focus on affordable housing.\nNo, no, no, I, I do, but, what I also—you appreciate—my Dad was a working class guy. We lived in a three bedroom home, 4 kids, and uh, grandpop lived with us. We weren't poor, but we, there wasn't any money left at the end of the day. And so, it's all about, it's all about treating people with dignity, and it's about making sure that, look, I mean, for example, look at the heat I'm getting it because I, I named a, the Secretary of Defense, a Black man. I named Ketanji Brown. I mean, because of the people I've named.\nIt's about making it clear that American history is Black history. Black history is American history, and it's being built by it. That's why we're strong.\nBecause you know where my heart is. You know where my head is. By the way, if you notice, whether it's young blacks or young whites or white Hispanics or young Asian Americans, they've never focused until after Labor Day. I mean, the idea they'd focus intently on election right now—is, it's, it's not there. And by the way, if take a look at the uh, presidents who have won. At this stage of the game in the last seven or eight presidents, five of them were losing at this time, by significant margins.\nThe point is we're just gettin’ down to game time now. We, we've put together the largest volunteer organization, I think, in America. There were 2 million 2 hundred thousand individual contributors, small contributors, raising 10s of millions of dollars for me to be able to compete. So I think you're gonna be surprised at the reg— by the way, for example, I was, was in South Carolina. Went to a, a goin’ to a Black home where a dad and his son were sittin’ at the kitchen table with ‘em and they talked about it. And, after was all over, his father said “No, no one's talked to my son like this before. No one said—you really mean it.” I do mean it. I mean it.\nIt's about why he got involved in the first place, Ed. Look—I got out of school, high school, and my state was segregated by law, to it's great shame, in Delaware. And we got involved in the civil rights movement, no great shakes, just sit-ins, and, you know. And things like that. And the end result of this was, all the friends I made, for example, one of the guys who, ah, my mom talks about, when Barack would call me, and sayin’ he wanted to do a background check on me, so wanted to think of me as Vice President. I said “I don't wanna be Vice President.” And he said, “No, no, there's only you and three others, uh two others,” [I] Said Barack, “I can help you more as a Senator, I really believe that.” He said, “No, no.” He said, “Well damn it, it is only you.” And I said, “Barack, I don't want to be Vice President.” And he said, “Well go home. Go home and talk about it. He knows my paren—my mom. My dad's dead. So we had a meeting. I was on the train and then going back to Wilmington.\nAnd when I got home, we sat on the back porch, called the family together. My son was alive then—my two sons, my daughter. The only outside fam—other than a family member—who was there, was Ted Kaufman who was my best friend and my assis as a Sen— stepped into the Senate when I got elected Vice President. And, uh, so we went around the room. “What do you want—”on the porch—“what do you wanna do?”\nMy Mom—and my wife said “You oughta do it because if you don't, he's gonna ask you to be Secretary of State and you’ll be away all the time. And then my son Beau, who was Attorney General, should be sitting here, not me. Said, “Dad, you have an obligation,” went through it. And so everybody made their case, and I still didn't want to do it. My mom was sitting against the railing, and—over on the porch, it’s like a story up from the ground. And I said, “Honey, you haven't said anything.” She said, “Joey.” She said, “Remember when you were a kid? Remember when I called you when you got out of the race—with Barack. And you asked about him, saying he's really brave. He's an honorable man. He'll make a good president.”\nAnd I said, “Yeah, Mom, I remember that.” “Remember when you were a kid and they're desegregating Mayfield, the neighborhood we live. I mean, they, the neighboring neighborhood, called Lynnfield. You were 14 or 15 years old. I told you not to go down there because there were people protesting, but you went down and you got arrested for being on the porch with a Black family. And they brought you back home.”\nI said, “Yeah, I remember that, Mom.” She said, “Remember, you had that job as a lifeguard in a Country Club setting, but you wanted to be the only white guy to work in East Side of the projects as a liveguard?” Said, “Yeah Ma.” “So let me get this straight, honey. The first Black man in history has a chance to be President, you told him No?”\nThat's how it’s always been with me, in the Black community. It's the same community—by the way, one of the guys said, when I was a lifeguard back then, is uh, and I helped represent as a young public defender, is out here now. He's a major labor leader. Ah, these are, they're, they're, they're my friends, are still my friends. And they're still the ones that encouraged me to move.\nAnd, so I think that—and one thing does change, and it’s it's not an excuse, an explanation. I would ordinarily be going through Black neighborhoods on on ground, on the foot. Working through the neighborhoods. I have a tradition every, I close every campaign, no matter what campaign, going into the projects and going down the East Side. And, you know, “Hey, Joe, well how you doin’?” You know? Well, well—just because there my friends, let ‘em know I'm still there.\nWe can't do that now. Not because of the Black community, because it's too dangerous for me to be out walking unaccompanied.\nSo what I'm doing though is trying to keep in touch with as many of my Black constituents and letting people know that I'm available. I'm available. I really—it's the reason why I got involved in politics in the first place. Not a joke. Not a joke.\nEverybody deserves a shot. Everybody deserves a shot. And we've demonstrated, you give ‘em a shot, they step up. They step up in every community. That's why the Black community is doing as well as it is now, and it's gonna do better. We got to focus on making sure that this MAGA 25 deal that Trump has out there, does not succeed. They wanna wipe it all out.\nLook what's happening. All the folks in the Black community have prescription drug problems. They’re a lot of money. You have diabetes, you have, you know you need insulin. Four hundred bucks. It's now 35 bucks.\nThe Black community Black and East Side where I’m from ,where I was. You’re in a situation where no Black Americans, no any American over the age of 65 will have to pay more than $2000 year for all the prescriptions for the entire year, including cancer drugs that’re two to twelve, fifteen thousand bucks.\nAnd so it's about giving healthcare. It's about making sure there's opportunity for people to have a good education. We should be—I've been pushing and we're going to get it done—early education. You know—you know all the studies better than I, as well as I do, that you come out of a neighborhood or a sc—a house where there's no books, where there's a, a dysfunctional family, where there's a problem—and you start off school, you hear million fewer words haven't been spoken because not, there's not conversation. Well, guess what? The studies show now, if you have three, four and five year olds going to early education, not, not daycare—education, you increase by 56% their ability to go through 12 years of school and on to Community College. And I'm gonna make Community College free. There's so many opportunities we have, and I think the community is beginning to see it. At least I hope so.\nHope you’ll have me back. I really mean it.\nIt's up to me.\nIf you call them, and if they say “No”, you call me.\nThanks pal.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-ed-gordon-bet-television-las-vegas-nevada"}
