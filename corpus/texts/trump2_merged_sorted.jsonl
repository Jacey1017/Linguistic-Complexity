{"Title": "Inaugural Address", "Date": "2025-01-20", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. [Applause] Wow. Thank you very, very much.\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now.\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end.\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.\nI return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\nAs we gather today, our Government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\nWe now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\nWe have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina—who have been treated so badly—and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. But we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\nOur liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's Government.\nOver the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\nFor American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day. It is my hope that our recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing States—[applause]—and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\nToday is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor—this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. [Applause] Can't do that.\nToday I will sign a series of historic Executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.\nI will end the practice of catch-and-release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government to use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\nNext, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it. We'll use it.\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\nWith my actions today, we will end the \"green new deal,\" and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice.\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my administration will establish the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency.\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an Executive order to immediately stop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about. [Laughter] We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\nThis week, I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: male and female.\nThis week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full backpay.\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [Applause] Thank you.\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great President, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent—he was a natural businessman—and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States—the United States—I mean, think of this—spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.\nAnd above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization.\nSo, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our Nation.\nAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best.\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4 greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We're going to win like never before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nIn recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and good will. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\nThank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/inaugural-address-54"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel", "Date": "2025-02-04", "Text": "Thank you very much.\nThat's a lot of press. Congratulations. You bring them out. [Laughter]\nYou really bring them out.\nToday, I'm delighted to welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to the White House. It's a wonderful feeling and a wonderful event. We had fantastic talks—and thank you very much—with your staff.\nHe's the first foreign head of state to visit during our administration. And, Bibi, I want to say, it's an honor to have you with us. Over the past 4 years, the U.S. and the Israeli alliance has been tested more than any time in history, but the bonds of friendship and affection between the American and Israeli people have endured for generations, and they are absolutely unbreakable. They are unbreakable.\nI'm confident that, under our leadership, the cherished alliance between our two countries will soon be stronger than ever. We had a great relationship. We had great victories together four years ago. Not so many victories over the past four years, however.\nIn my first term, Prime Minister and I forged a tremendously successful partnership that brought peace and stability to the Middle East like it hadn't seen in decades.\nTogether, we defeated ISIS, we ended the disastrous Iran nuclear deal—one of the worst deals ever made, by the way—and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. We starved Hamas and Iran's other terrorist proxies, and we starved them like they had never seen before—resources and support disappeared for them.\nI recognized Israel's capital; opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and got it built, by the way—built it too, just—not only designated it but got it built at a price that nobody has seen for 40 years. We got it built. It's beautiful, all Jerusalem stone, right from nearby, and it was—it's something that's very special. And recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something that they talked about for 70 years and they weren't able to get it. And I got it.\nAnd with the historic Abraham Accords—something that was really an achievement that was, I think, going to become more and more important, because we achieved the most significant Middle East peace agreements in half a century—but the Abraham Accords, in particular. And I really believe that many countries will soon be joining this amazing peace and economic development transaction. It really is a big economic development transaction. I think we're going to have a lot of people signing up very quickly.\nUnfortunately, for 4 years, nobody signed up. Nobody did anything for 4 years, except in the negative—unfortunately, the weakness and incompetence of those years, those past 4 years—the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East—grave damage all over the globe.\nThe horrors of October 7 would never have happened if I were President. The Ukraine and Russia disaster would never have happened if I were President.\nOver the past 16 months, Israel has endured a sustained, aggressive, and murderous assault on every front, but they've fought back bravely. You see that, and you know that. What we have witnessed is an all-out attack on the very existence of a Jewish state in the Jewish homeland.\nThe Israelis have stood strong and united in the face of an enemy that has kidnapped, tortured, raped, and slaughtered innocent men, women, children, and even little babies. I want to salute the Israeli people for meeting this trial with courage and determination and unflinching resolve. They have been strong.\nIn our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I focused on the future, discussing how we can work together to ensure Hamas is eliminated and ultimately restore peace to a very troubled region. It's been troubled, but what's happened in the last four years has not been good.\nI want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for working closely with my transition team; the Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff, who is here somewhere. Steve. Stand up, Steve, please. What a job you have done. What a good job you've done. Proud of you. Done a fantastic job. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Thank you, Mike, for working so well with us. Thank you.\nWe have, in addition, Marco Rubio, who is on the phone right now, listening to every single word that we say—[laughter]—and he's going to be great. And, Pete, congratulations. And, Scott, congratulations. I see you're here. And Karoline has been doing a great job. She's, really, probably talked about more than anybody here. [Laughter] She's done a fantastic job. And thank you very much, Karoline. We're proud of you.\nBut we'll only be satisfied when all of these problems are solved. And we have the team to solve them, and that's going to happen, and it's going to happen, I think, very quickly.\nI also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who live there—and frankly, who's been really very unlucky—it's been very unlucky; it's been an unlucky place for a long time—being in its presence just has not been good, and it should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there.\nInstead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts—and there are many of them that want to do this—and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and, frankly, bad luck.\nThis could be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. It could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace, and we'll get sure—we'll make sure something really spectacular is done. They're going to have peace. They're not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilization of wonderful people has had to endure.\nThe only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is, they have no alternative. It's right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually, every building is down. They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious.\nThey instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety, and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony, instead of having to go back and do it again.\nThe U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings. Level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\nJust can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for a hundred years. I'm hopeful that this cease-fire could be the beginning of a larger and more enduring peace that will end the bloodshed and killing once and for all.\nWith the same goal in mind, my administration has been moving quickly to restore trust in the alliance and rebuild American strength throughout the region, and we've really done that. We're a respected nation again. A lot has happened in the last couple of weeks. We are actually a—we're very respected nation again.\nI ended the last administration's de facto arms embargo on over $1 billion in military assistance for Israel. And I'm also pleased to announce that this afternoon, the United States withdrew from the anti-Semitic U.N. Human Rights Council and ended all of the support for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which funneled money to Hamas and which was very disloyal to humanity.\nToday I also took action to restore a maximum-pressure policy on the Iranian regime. And we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports to zero, and diminish the regime's capacity to fund terror throughout the region and throughout the world.\nWe had no threat when I left office. Iran was not able to sell oil. Nobody was buying oil because I said: \"Don't buy it. If you buy it, you're not doing any business with the United States.\" And Hamas was not being funded. Hizballah was not being funded. Nobody was being funded. There would never have been an October 7.\nTwo weeks ago, I once again designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization. They're trying to destroy world shipping lanes, and that's not going to happen. And over the weekend, I ordered air strikes against senior ISIS leaders hiding in the caves of Somalia and took them out.\nHere in America, we've begun the process of deporting foreign terrorists, jihadists, and Hamas sympathizers from our soil, just as we have people that are extremely evil, and we're sending them out of our country. They came from jails, they came from mental institutions and insane asylums, and they were dumped into our country. They're gang members. We're getting them out at numbers that nobody can actually believe.\nAnd every single country is taking those people back. They said they would never take them back, and they're all taking them back. And they're taking them back very gladly.\nAnd I recently signed an executive order combating the vile wave of anti-Semitism that we've seen in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks.\nTogether, America and Israel will renew the optimism that shined so brightly just four years ago. It was really a bright, beautiful light. We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, and hope to our nations and for all people of the Middle East, including the Arab and Muslim nations. Very important. We want the Arab and Muslim nations to have peace and have tranquility and have great lives.\nI'd like to now invite Prime Minister Netanyahu to say a few words, and we'll take some questions afterwards.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much, Bibi. Very nice. Thank you.\nAnd J.D. Vance, everybody. J.D., please. Vice President, stand up. He's been doing a good job. He's been working very hard on all things, but this in particular.\nWe'll take some questions, please.\n[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead, please. Go ahead.\nYes, go ahead.\nSo Saudi Arabia is going to be very helpful, and they have been very helpful. They want peace in the Middle East. It's very simple. We know their leader and their leaders very well. They're wonderful people, and they want peace in the Middle East.\nAs far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that. We're going to take over that piece, and we're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.\nBut everybody feels that continuing the same process that's gone on forever, over and over again, and then it starts, and then the killing starts, and all of the other problems start, and you end up in the same place, and we don't want to see that happen.\nSo, by the United States, with its stability and strength, owning it—especially the strength that we're developing and developed over the last fairly short period of time—I would say, really since the election—I think we'll be a great keeper of something that is very, very strong, very powerful, and very, very good for the area—not just for Israel, for the entire Middle East—very important.\nAnd we'll, again, have thousands of jobs. And there will be jobs for everyone, not for a specific group of people, but for everybody.\nOkay, please.\nIt's true—many, many more. I agree, many more nations.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nWell, I can't tell you whether or not the cease-fire will hold. We've done, I think, a very masterful job. And we weren't helped very much by the Biden administration, I can tell you that.\nBut we've gotten quite a few hostages out. We're going to get more out. But we're dealing with very complex people, and we are going to see whether or not it holds. We certainly want to have more come out. They've come out damaged—in many ways, damaged—very damaged people, but they're going to get better, and they're going to be strong, and they're going to have a good life. And we hope to get as many as possible out.\nWhether or not it holds, I don't know. We hope it holds. We hope it holds.\nKelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. Kelly, go ahead, please.\nI do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East. And everybody I've spoken to—this was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in a really magnificent area that nobody would know. Nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over. It's just a terrible sight.\nI've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different angle. And it's a very, very dangerous place to be, and it's only going to get worse.\nAnd I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous—and I'm talking about from the highest level of leadership—gotten tremendous praise. And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that.\nYes, please, go ahead. Go ahead.\nYes.\nWe're working very hard to get all the hostages. The word is \"all,\" and we are working very hard. So far, it's been moving along fairly rapidly, pretty much on schedule. It's—I'd love to have them all out at one time, but we're taking them out.\nAnd tomorrow, more are being released, and over the days more, and then we'll go into a phase two. But we'd like to get all of the hostages.\nAnd if we don't, it will just make us somewhat more violent, I will tell you that, because they would have broken their word.\nWell, we're discussing that with many of your representatives. You're represented very well, and people do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet, but we will be—we'll be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next 4 weeks.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please. Please.\nIt doesn't mean anything about a two-state or a one-state or any other state. It means that we want to have—we want to give people a chance at life. They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It's been horrible. The Hamas has made it so bad—so bad, so dangerous, so unfair to people.\nAnd by doing what I'm recommending that we do, it's a recommendation—a very strong recommendation—but it is a strong recommendation—by doing that, we think we're going to bring perhaps great peace to long beyond this area.\nAnd I have to stress, this is not for Israel. This is for everybody in the Middle East—Arabs, Muslims. This is for everybody. This would be where they can partake in terms of jobs and living and all of the other benefits. And I think it's very important.\nIt just doesn't work the other way. You know, you can't keep trying. They just—has been going along for so many decades, you can't even count. You just can't keep doing—you have to learn from history. You can't keep doing the same mistake over and over again.\nGaza is a hellhole right now. It was before the bombing started, frankly, and we're going to give people a chance to live in a beautiful community that's safe and secure. And I think you're going to see tremendous—a tremendous outflowing of support.\nI can tell you, I spoke to other leaders of countries in the Middle East, and they love the idea. They say it would really bring stability, and what we need is stability.\nYes, sir, please.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead, Bibi.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead.\nI have a little hard time understanding you. Where are you from?\nOh, actually, it's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. The only problem is, I can't understand a word you're saying. [Laughter]\nBut—but I just say this: Good luck. Live in peace.\nGo ahead, please.\nIran/U.S. Sanctions\nThat's okay. Yes, please.\nYes.\nI hated doing it. I want Iran to be peaceful and successful. I hated doing it. I did it once before, and we brought them down to a level where they were unable to give any money. They had to survive themselves, and they had no money. They were essentially broke, and they had no money for, as I said, Hizballah. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for any form of terror—the 28—if you call it, the 28 sites of terror. They had no money for any of it.\nThey had to do their own and focus on their own well-being. And I hated to do it then, and I hate it—I hate to do it just as much now.\nAnd I say this, and I say this to Iran, who is listening very intently: I would love to be able to make a great deal, a deal where you can get on with your lives, and you'll do wonderfully. You'll do wonderfully.\nIncredible people—industrious, beautiful, just an unbelievable group of people in Iran. And I know them well. I have many friends from Iran and many friends that are Americans from Iran, and they're very proud of Iran.\nBut I hated to do it, just so you understand. And I hope we're going to be able to do something so that it doesn't end up in a very catastrophic situation. I don't want to see that happen. I want to see——\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nI really want to see peace, and I hope that we're able to do that.\nThey cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. I'm not putting restrictions. I'm not—they cannot have—one thing: They cannot have a nuclear weapon.\nAnd if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, that—I think that's going to be very unfortunate for them.\nIf, on the other hand, they can convince us that they won't, and I hope they can—it's very easy to do; it's actually very easy to do—I think they're going to have an unbelievable future.\nYes, please. Sir, go ahead.\nYes.\nFor Ukraine?\nSo we're dealing right now on the subject—I don't want to spend a lot of time because we're here for another reason—but we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. And we're talking to the Russians. We're talking to the Ukrainian leadership.\nIt would have never happened. That would have never happened—it should have never happened. I get reports every week: the number of soldiers—mostly soldiers now. The cities have been largely demolished. You talk about a very sad sight to see.\nWe talk Gaza. Well, many of these cities look as bad as Gaza and worse—what's happened to them—and I want to see that end.\nAnd I want to see it end for one simple reason: the life of young people being absolutely obliterated on both sides. You probably have 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, 800,000—maybe more—Russian soldiers dead. It's very flat land, and the only thing that's going to stop a bullet is a human body—in this case, usually soldiers.\nAnd the numbers are staggering, when you hear the real numbers in Ukraine, what the numbers are, and this doesn't include the cities that have been demolished and all of the people that were killed. So I want to see it stopped.\nWe're having very good talks, and I think we're going to get it. I think something will be, hopefully, dramatically—it will—it will rise above everything. You have to. You can't let this continue. You can't—this is an absolute slaughter that's taking place on the beautiful farmlands of Ukraine, and we have to stop it. We can't let this continue.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nIt's a human—it's a human—it is a human tragedy, and we're going to try very hard to stop it.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nYes, please. Go ahead, sir. Go ahead.\nGo ahead, Bibi. Go ahead.\nWell, I said it, and he said it very well. It's a—it's a campaign of pressure to see if we can get something done. He doesn't want to do what some people think will automatically happen, because they're very difficult people to deal with, as you know.\nBut if we could solve this problem without warfare, without all of the things that you've been witnessing over the last number of years, it would be—I think it would be a tremendous thing.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please.\nTo visit where?\nOh, well, I love—I love Israel. I will visit there and I'll visit Gaza and I'll visit Saudi Arabia, and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East. The Middle East is an incredible place—so vibrant, so—it's just one of the really beautiful places and the—with great people.\nAnd I think a lot of bad leadership has taken place in the Middle East that's allowed this to happen. It's just terrible—and that includes on the American side, by the way. We should have never gone in there a long time ago, spent trillions of dollars, and created so much death, so—and that includes Americans.\nBut yes, I'll be visiting a lot of different places in the Middle East. I've been invited everywhere, but I will be visiting some. Yes.\nKaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN], go ahead. Kaitlan.\nKaitlan, go ahead.\nSay it? Go ahead, please.\nI envision world people living there—the world's people. I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. And I think the entire world—representatives from all over the world will be there, and they'll——\n——and they'll live there. Palestinians, also. Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there.\nBut they've tried the other, and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. It's not going to work. It didn't work. It will never work. And you have to learn from history. History has—you know, you just can't let it keep repeating itself.\nWe have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal—and I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy—but the Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so——\n——this could be so magnificent.\nBut more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed—that live there now—can live in peace in a much better situation, because they are living in hell. And those people will now be able to live in peace. We'll make sure that it's done world class. It will be wonderful for the people—Palestinians——\n——Palestinians, mostly, we're talking about. And I have a feeling that—despite them saying no, I have a feeling that the King in Jordan and the general, President—but that the general in Egypt will open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done, and people can live in harmony and in peace.\nThank you all very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan", "Date": "2025-02-07", "Text": "Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. It's a great honor to be with the Prime Minister. We had a picture taken a little while ago. And it was so nice, I thought I'd present it to you on stage, and here's the picture.\nAudience member.Ahh.\nI wish I was as handsome as him, but I'm not. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President gave the Prime Minister a photograph.]\nWe remember that day.\nThank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\nI'm delighted to welcome Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru to the White House for the first time. And, Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us, a great honor. Japan is a great country. Thank you very much.\nJapan is strong and proud. It's a nation that is home to one of the great civilizations in the history of the world. For nearly 80 years, the American-Japanese people have enjoyed a friendship like few others—we've had a great friendship—across a vast ocean. And we found ourselves united by bonds of history, commerce, culture, mutual admiration, and great respect.\nAfter our meeting today, I'm confident that the cherished alliances between our two countries—and others, also—will continue to flourish long and into the future.\nThe military cooperation between the United States and Japan is one of our closest security partnerships, and it's one of the closest we have anywhere in the world. Our servicemembers work together every day to defend our common interests.\nJapan has committed to double its defense spending by 2027, compared to my first term. They've invested a lot of money because of my first term. We worked on that very hard with Shinzo—you know, the great Shinzo Abe. And we look forward to seeing even more so. Shinzo and I worked very, very long and hard, and those numbers are very reflective, after my first term. And now they're going up very substantially based on our conversations today.\nIn addition to being vital for our shared security, Japan is one of the top purchasers of U.S. military exports and equipment. And I'm pleased to say that, this week, my administration approved nearly a billion dollars in foreign military sales to Tokyo.\nThe United States is totally committed to the security of Japan. We will extend the full strength of American deterrence capabilities in defense of our friend and ally, hundred percent.\nIn the years to come, the Prime Minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security—and I also say peace through strength—and all over the Indo-Pacific. And to that end, we also remain committed to the effort I began in my first term to ensure safety and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\nPrime Minister Ishiba and I spoke long and hard about a vital economic relationship between our two countries and the continuance of that relationship. The United States and Japan trade over $300 billion in goods and services each year. Japan has invested nearly $800 billion—and that's going to go up very, very substantially in the coming months—more than any other country.\nAnd they're going to have some competition. We have a lot of people coming in and investing in the United States. I think our—the feeling throughout the world has never been stronger about this country.\nAs a result of our victory in 2024, the Presidential election, the Japanese investment and technology giant SoftBank announced plans to invest between $100 and $200 billion. We have many other companies investing that number, higher than that number. Some, a little bit less. But we have trillions of dollars of investment pouring into our country now that you didn't have just a short while ago.\nToday our teams discussed how our two Nations can do even more to stay on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, along with the quantum computing, semiconductors, and other critical technologies—and they're coming out. The problem with technology, that kind: It's obsolete in about 2 days, so we have to start all over again. Doesn't last long.\nWe agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive.\nI'm also pleased to announce that Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas in record numbers. It will be record numbers.\nWith our Secretary of the Interior, we were talking—I think Doug is here. Hello, Doug. Please stand up, Doug. Doug Burgum, everybody.\nWe're talking about the pipeline in Alaska, which is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far, less than half the distance of any other location. We're talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and us, having to do with Alaska oil and gas, and that's very exciting. They're very excited about it. So are we.\nAs we deepen our economic relationship, I made clear that the United States will be conducting trade with all countries based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. Chronic trade deficits not only undermine our economy—they really do, and we're going to get rid of the trade—we have a trade deficit with Japan of over $100 billion. But we're going to work that out, and I think very quickly. Frankly, we can do it just on oil and gas. We can work it out. So we intend to do it very quickly. We both understand that.\nAnd as America welcomes new foreign investment, we also want to ensure that companies build their products and factories here in America, not simply by the assets that we have.\nAnd Japan is going to be opening up auto plants. New auto plants are being built, currently as we speak. They've just been started. Toyota is one, and Nissan is going to be doing something very exciting about—about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase.\nWe didn't like the idea. U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years many years ago—80 years ago—and we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave, but the concept—psychologically, not good.\nSo they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel, as opposed to own it. And that sounds very exciting. And we're going to meet with Nissan next week, the head of Nissan—a very great company—and they'll work out the details. I'll help. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate.\nAnd I had the privilege of working closely with the great Prime Minister—as you know, and you knew him very well—Shinzo Abe, the longest serving Prime Minister in Japan's history. Likewise, I expect that this Prime Minister is going to be a great one.\nI really believe that. He's going to be a great one. I've gotten to know him for not long, but I can see what they have. He's got—he's got the qualities of greatness. He's going to do a fantastic job for Japan and for the Japanese people.\nAnd I'd like now to invite the Prime Minister to say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nAny questions, please? Peter [Peter Doocy, Fox News].\nWhite House Senior Adviser Elon R. Musk\nOh, I think she'll be okay with it somehow. [Laughter]\nWell, it doesn't, but they get it very easily. I mean, we don't have very good security in our country, and they get it very easily. And what we're doing, if you look at what has just taken place with respect to some of the investments that have been made on another agency that people have been talking about for years, but nobody did anything about it, it's absolutely obscene—dangerous, bad, very costly.\nI mean, virtually every investment made is a con job. There's nothing of value to anybody, unless there's a kickback scheme going on, which is possible.\nAnd we're going to be doing more and more and more of that. We're going to be looking at Department of Education. We're going to be looking at even our military. We're going to be looking at tremendous amounts of money, Peter, being spent on things that bear no relationship to anything and have no value.\nWe're talking about trillions of dollars. It will be, in the end, trillions of dollars being absolutely wasted and perhaps illegally—I would say, certainly, in many cases, illegally—but perhaps illegally overall.\nAnd I'm very proud of the job that this group of young people—generally, young people, but very smart people—they're doing. They're doing it at my insistence. It would be a lot easier not to do it, but we have to take some of these things apart to find the corruption. And we've found tremendous corruption.\nOh, I see the same ones. I see Maxine Waters, a lowlife. I see, you know, all these people. They don't—they don't love our country. They don't love our country. We want great education.\nSo they rank 40 countries in education. We're ranked dead last—dead last. But the good news is we're number one in one category. You know what that is? Cost per pupil. We spend more per pupil than on—any other country in the world. You look at Norway, Denmark, Sweden, various countries all up and down—Finland—China does very well in education—and then you look at us. We spend much more money than they do per pupil—or any other way, but we spend much more money than they do. And yet we're ranked, this year, last—Biden's last year—congratulations, Joe—we're ranked dead last.\nSo what I want to see is education. Number one, I like choice. We all like choice. But beyond choice—long beyond choice, I want to see it go back to the States, where great States that do so well—have no debt, they're operated brilliantly—they'll be as good as Norway or Denmark or Sweden or any of the other highly ranked countries. They'll be—you'll probably have 30—I figure 35 to 38 States will be right at the top, and the rest will come along. They'll have to come along, competitively.\nAnd by the way, we'll be spending a lot less money, and we'll have great education.\nWell, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the Vice President said that—did you say that?\nVice President James D. \"J.D.\" Vance. I did say that.\nI'm with the Vice President. [Laughter]\nThank you, Peter.\n[Several reporters began speaking at once.]\nWell, I want our military to be the strongest. I also don't mind spending so much money on the military, because we build it here. It's made in the U.S.A. All made in the U.S.A.\nWe have—you know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. Did a great job. We left some of it behind in Afghanistan, stupidly. There was no reason for that. But it was still—as much as it was—it was billions and billions of dollars, but it was a small part of it.\nBut we're going to have the strongest military by far. We have great people. I want to congratulate Pete Hegseth for having gone through the gauntlet. He went through a lot, but he got through, and he's going to be a tremendous—I have no doubt he's going to be a tremendous leader. And other of the leaders sitting here, they're—in their own fields, they're going to—we're going to do something very—very great, and we expect great things.\nBut I expect the strongest military, by far, in the world—far stronger than China, far stronger than anybody, and that's the way it is.\nThank you very much.\nWould you like to ask a question? Please. Go ahead.\nThank you.\nSure.\nJapan-U.S. Relations/U.S. Trade Policy\nI think that he is going to be a great Prime Minister. I think he's a very strong man—very, very strong. I have great respect for him. I've known him for a long time, through a reputation. Shinzo Abe thought the world of him, and I think he's going to do a fantastic job as Prime Minister.\nA very strong person. I wish he wasn't so strong. [Laughter] I wish he was a little bit weaker than that, but that's what I got. [Laughter] I have to get strong guys all the time. He's going to be a great Prime Minister.\nI also—in terms of tariffs, I mean, we're going to have tariffs. Mostly reciprocal tariffs, where we go with—and I'm going to be probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday—have an announcement, probably a news conference. But probably reciprocal tariffs, where a country pays so much or charges us so much, and we do the same.\nSo very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. That way, nobody is hurt. They charge us. We charge them. It's the same thing. And I seem to be going in that line, as opposed to a flat fee tariff.\nYes, go. Please. Please, go ahead. Why don't you go ahead?\nThank you very much.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes.\nThey're doing it as an investment, no longer a purchase.\nI didn't want it purchased, but investment I love.\nAnd they're going to do a big investment, subject to getting the deal done. And they'll be doing a big——\nI'm okay with that, sure.\nWell, we didn't discuss tariffs too much. We really discussed many other things, including the pipeline in Alaska, which I think is going to be maybe the most exciting thing—with Doug and Chris. We discussed that at length, the pipeline. I mean, it seemed to be of great interest to them.\nIt's—we have potentially more oil and gas than in Saudi Arabia, just in Alaska. We have the most of any country in the world. It's a big asset for the United States, but we haven't used it.\nWe go to Venezuela, we go to other places to take oil and gas, and we have more than anybody. It's an amazing phenomenon that took place over the last 4 years. Nobody understands it, including the people that were in charge of it. They had no clue what they were doing. So it was a big problem.\nThey were surprised, actually, too. They were saying, \"Why? Why didn't they\"—They—they wouldn't sell them LNG. They wouldn't sell. Japan wanted to buy LNG, and Biden wouldn't sell it. And I'm trying to figure that one out. Maybe it was the environment.\nYou might answer that question. He's curious about that himself, I think.\nThank you very much.\nIf you want to answer that, you may—about LNG, that the United States wouldn't sell you LNG.\nI want to just say that, on the ethanol, Iowa is going to be very happy. All of the—Nebraska, all of our farm States are going to be very happy. They want ethanol, and we'll be able to provide it. So our farmers—who I like, and they like me—I think they're going to be very, very happy.\nWe've opened the sale of LNG immediately. Actually, we did it a few days ago. And China—and right now, not only China, everybody wants to buy it. We have more than anybody, and they're all buying it. But Japan, in particular, we're very happy that they're going to start immediately, and we can supply it to the world, but we're supplying it to Japan, and they're going to always be right up in the front of the line.\nYes, go ahead. Please. Go ahead.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nYes, I have.\nPentagon, Education, just about everything. We're going to go through everything, just as it was so bad with what we just went through with this horrible situation we just went through, and I guess 97 percent of the people have been dismissed. It was very, very unfortunate.\nYou're not going to find anything like that, but you're going to find a lot. And I've instructed him to go check out Education, to check out the Pentagon, which is the military. And you know, sadly, you'll find some things that are pretty bad. But I don't think, proportionally, you're going to see anything like we just saw.\nNo, but I'll fire some of them because some of them were corrupt. I have no doubt about that. I got to know a lot about that business, that world.\nI got to know a lot about that world, and we had some corrupt agents, and those people are gone, or they will be gone, and it will be done quickly and very surgically.\nDid you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nTalk up.\nI don't know. I don't know. I know we have some that are very corrupt, and we don't like it. We're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI. Kash Patel is going to do a great job, and we're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI, which has been hurt very badly. It's been devastated over the last 4 years.\nIt's actually a good question, and we will have relations with North Korea and with Kim Jong Un. I got along with him very well, as you know. I think I stopped a war. I think if I wouldn't have won that particular election, you would have ended up in that——\n——a very bad—a very bad situation, but I did. And we had a good relationship, and I think it's a very big asset for everybody that I do get along with him. I like—I mean, I get along with him. He gets along with me. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\nAnd I can tell you that Japan likes the idea, because their relationship is not very good with him. And if I can have a relationship with not only him but other people throughout the world where there seem to be difficulties, I think that's a tremendous asset for the world, not just the United States.\nGo ahead, Garrett [Garrett Haake, NBC News].\nWhite House Senior Adviser Elon R. Musk\nWell, we haven't discussed that much. I'll tell him to go here, go there. He does it. He's got a very capable group of people, very, very, very capable. They know what they're doing. They'll ask questions, and they'll see immediately, as somebody gets tongue tied, that they're either crooked or don't know what they're doing.\nWe have very smart people going in. So I've instructed him, \"Go into Education, go into military, go into other things as we go along.\" And they're finding massive amounts of fraud, abuse, waste, all of these things.\nSo—but I will pick out a target, and I say, \"Go in.\" There could be areas that we won't, but I can—I think everything's fertile. You know, we're a Government. We have to be open, and as an open Government—I don't know, I guess you could say maybe some high intelligence or something. And I'll do that myself, if I have to.\nBut generally speaking, I'll just say, \"Go.\" But he will be looking at Education pretty quickly, and he will be looking at military too.\nSure.\nWell, they don't really have to be looked at by him. They can be looked at by us. Social Security will not be touched. It will only be strengthened.\nWe have illegal immigrants on Social Security, and we're going to find out who they are and take them out. We have illegal immigrants in other—Medicare. We have—we found a lot of bad people, a lot of people that shouldn't be on that were put on when—through California. They come—a lot of them come out of California. We're not going to stand for that.\nSo we're going to strengthen our Social Security, et cetera. We're not going to touch it, other than to make it stronger. But we have people that shouldn't be on, and those people we have to weed out. Most of them or many of them, so far, have been illegal immigrants. They shouldn't even be in the country.\nDo you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nThat's a very good answer. [Laughter] Very good answer. Wow. That's very good. He knows what he's doing.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba-japan"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India", "Date": "2025-02-13", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please. Great honor.\nI'm thrilled to welcome the Prime Minister of India, my friend, Narendra Modi back to the White House. We spent a lot of time here and a lot of time in India, and he's a very special man.\nPrime Minister, it is a pleasure to extend to you the same hospitality that you showed Melania and myself when we traveled to your beautiful country 5 years ago. It's hard to believe so long ago, and it seemed like yesterday. It was beautiful. We opened the cricket stadium—129,000 seats, I think the largest stadium in the world, and it was an incredible period of time.\nThere is truly a special bond between the United States and India and the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy and, I believe, the world's largest country, in terms of the numbers of people. And today the Prime Minister and I are announcing a framework to strengthen those ties even further economically, and the U.S.-India compact for the 21st century is a historic initiative that will deepen every aspect of our partnership and our friendship.\nStarting this year, we'll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters.\nIn 2017, my administration revived and reinvigorated the Quad security partnership. In our meeting today, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it's crucial really to maintaining peace and prosperity, tranquility even, in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn addition, the United States and India will be working together like never before to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, a threat all over the world actually.\nToday I'm pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and one of the very evil people of the world and having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India. So he's going to be going back to India to face justice.\nAs we deepen our defense partnership, we'll also strengthen our economic ties and bring greater fairness and reciprocity to our trading relationship.\nAs a signal of good faith, Prime Minister Modi recently announced the reductions to India's unfair, very strong tariffs that limit U.S. access into the Indian market very strongly. And really, it's big problem, I must say. India imposes a 30- to 40- to 60- and even 70-percent tariff on so many of the goods and, in some cases, far more than that.\nAs an example, a 70-percent tariff on U.S. cars going into India, which makes it pretty much impossible to sell those cars.\nToday, the U.S. trade deficit with India is almost $100 billion, and Prime Minister Modi and I have agreed that we'll begin negotiations to address the long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last 4 years—but they didn't do that—in the U.S.-India trading relationship, with the goal of a—signing an agreement. And we want—really, we want a certain level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we're going to work on that very hard. And we can make up the difference very easily with the deficit with the sale of oil and gas and LNG, of which we have more than anybody in the world.\nThe Prime Minister and I also reached an important agreement on energy that will restore the United States as a leading supplier of oil and gas to India. It will be, hopefully, their number-one supplier in the groundbreaking development for U.S. nuclear industry. India is also reforming its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology, which is at the highest level, into the Indian market. This will bring safe, clean, and affordable electricity to millions of Indians and tens of billions of dollars to the U.S.-civilian nuclear industry in India.\nAnd under the framework we are announcing today, the United States and India are also joining forces to ensure that artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies are developed by the two of the most—really, two of the most advanced nations, intellectually and otherwise technologically, anywhere in the world. There's nobody very much closer. We have an incredible relationship there. And those are—this is where it seems to be heading.\nAnd artificial intelligence—complex—a very complex subject, but it seems to be where people want to be and they want to go, and we're leading right now by a lot, but other people will try to catch us. I don't know if they're going to be able to. We're going to make it available. We're going to make tremendous amounts of electricity available, and we're going to let the people that are buying the electricity make their own electric plants—electric generation plants, and we've never done this in our country, but we're going to get it done very quickly.\nLee Zeldin and his group are going to get the approvals in very rapid form. And we're calling it a \"national emergency,\" and that's exactly what it is. So we're going to be—we're going to remain at the top of the AI or artificial intelligence, I think, for a long time to come, and we're going to be working very closely with India and other countries on that. But right now we're the leader by quite a bit.\nFinally, we agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history. It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States, connecting our partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables—many, many undersea cables. It's a big development. It's a lot of money going to be spent, and we've already spent some, but we're going to be spending a lot more in order to stay advanced and stay the leader.\nI'm pleased to report that with today's announcements, the friendship between the United States and India is the strongest I believe it's ever been. I think our relationship is the best it's ever been between two leaders of the two countries, and it's an honor to say that.\nI'd like to now invite the Prime Minister to say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And we appreciate you all being here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.\nThank you. Thank you very much. Great job.\nBeautiful.\nOkay, thank you very much. That was excellent.\nWe'll do a few questions, please.\nPlease, go ahead. Please, go ahead. Yes. Yes, blue shirt.\nYou're going to have to go louder.\n——a word he's saying. It's not the—it's the accent. It's a little bit tough for me.\nHow about—how about you. Please. Go ahead, back there.\nThat's your question, but I'll answer it. I agree with you. [Laughter] Yes, gross incompetence.\nWe're going to have a fantastic relationship. And it has been like the whole world has been set back over the last 4 years by the weakness of the United States, the weak leadership of the United States, but I think we've taken care of it in just 3 weeks. It seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn't prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it—not only our country, but the whole world.\nThe Prime Minister told me that before too. Even over India, the world has a light. They need the United States to be strong and powerful but good, and I think that's happened. And I think it's happened in a very short period of time.\nBut I will tell you, we're going to have a fantastic relationship, and it will make both countries much stronger.\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nAll right?\nYes, go ahead, please.\nOkay. Fine.\nIndia-U.S. Relations\nWell, I don't think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration. Biden—they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe, because, you know, it's a good thing to do. And a lot of things happened that weren't very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration—the Biden administration.\nBut as you said, we're giving a very violent man—it seems to me—I mean, I don't know that he's been convicted yet or will be, but let's assume he's a pretty violent person—we're giving him back to India immediately. And there are more to follow, because we have quite a few requests.\nSo we work with India on crime, and we want to make it good for India, and it's very important. So that kind of a relationship is very important to us.\nOkay?\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please.\nGo ahead.\nIndia-U.S. Trade Relations/European Union/China/Tariffs\nSure.\nWell, India has been, to us, just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world. They've been very strong on tariffs, and I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.\nWe are right now a reciprocal nation. We are going to—if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them. Whatever another country charges, we're charging them. So it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. We didn't have that.\nWe—I was going to do that in my other term, and we had the greatest economy ever in the world. We've never—there's never been an economy like we had, and then we got hit with COVID. We had a focus on that, and I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare.\nBut we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know, and we didn't do the tariffs. We would have done the reciprocal tariffs, but we decided—and I decided, I think, on a human basis—on a humane basis not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems.\nBut now we do—we're doing—we see a tremendous future for our country. But we felt that now it's finally time, after 45 or 50 years of abuse, that we will do—and this isn't India, this is among a lot of nations.\nThe European Union is very difficult for us—very, very difficult. They tax our companies at levels that nobody's ever seen before. They take advantage of a lot of things. So we're not happy about that.\nChina, of course, is terrible, and we've never taken in 10 cents until I was President. We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been President—in first term and now—and we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness, and that's what I've done.\nAnd so, we are being reciprocal with India. Whatever India charges, we charge them. So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge—I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high, and I was unable to get a concession. So we're just going to do it the easy way, and we're just going to say, \"Whatever you charge, we charge.\" And I think that's fair for the people of the United States, and I think it's actually fair for India.\nOkay?\nGo ahead, please. Ask to the Prime Minister, please.\nAsk to the Prime Minister, please.\nYes.\nWell, I—maybe I'll just go and—first on this one. We had some talks, and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people—largely, they overlap—\"You have to pay more money because it's unfair what we're doing. We're doing a tremendous amount more.\" We're probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight, and Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money. It's not equitable, and we want to see a counterbalance. We want to have them put up more money. They have to do that.\nAt the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day—yesterday. And we also had a very good conversation—I did, both—in both cases—with President Zelenskyy. And I think we're going to be able to do something. I think we're going to be able to make a deal, and I hope so, because it's a horrible war. It's a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least, already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like—nobody has ever seen anything like it since—certainly since the Second World War.\nAnd so I think we're going to be able to do something. We're working with President Zelenskyy and with President Putin, and my impression is that they—I know that President Zelenskyy wants to make a deal, and I also feel that—I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions.\nBut the meeting and the conversation—also, the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one, and my phone call with him was a very successful one.\nThank you. That was very nice.\nGo ahead, please.\nGo ahead. Please. Yes. Please.\nSir, go ahead, please.\nRussia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. If I were President, it would not have happened—absolutely would not have happened, and it didn't happen for 4 years.\nIf you look at what has taken place, under President Bush, they lost a lot. Under President Obama, they lost Crimea. Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing. Under Trump, they lost nothing—Ukraine lost nothing. They didn't give up anything. And you take a look at the other three Presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot.\nI think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they're in, it's got to be ended, and it's got to be stopped.\nNow, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory, and they also have said from day one—long before President Putin, they've said they cannot have Ukraine be in NATO. They said that very strongly.\nI actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. And Biden said it, and Zelenskyy said it, and I think that was one of the reasons—one of the starts of the war.\nBut from long before Putin, they said you cannot have—you cannot have Ukraine going in, in any way, into NATO. And I start from that standpoint. I think everybody knew that.\nNow, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they were able to make a deal where they can do that, that's fine with me. I really don't care. I want that bloodshed to stop. I don't want to see—you know, we have an ocean between us and the site we're talking about—the site of death. We're calling it the fields of death. We have a big ocean in between us. This is more important for Europe. We shouldn't be in—they have to equalize, and they're going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize.\nBut as far as the negotiation, it's too early to say what's going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won't, and it's all dependent on what is going to happen. The negotiation really hasn't started.\nBut I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that, and I think Ukraine knew that, because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until more recently. So that's the way it is, and I think that's the way it's going to have to be.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please. All right. Go ahead, please, with the tie.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nWith the tie, yes.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nIndia-U.S. Trade Relations\nOh, he's a much tougher negotiator than me, and he's a much better negotiator than me. There's not even a contest. Okay? [Laughter]\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nYes, go ahead. Please go ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, I think we are going to have a very good relationship with China. I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. That was a bridge too far. But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. We were very close, as leaders go. I don't want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close.\nAnd I think that China is a very important player in the world. I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia.\nAnd I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped. That's been going on for a long time, and it's quite violent. It's quite violent.\nBut I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along. It's very important.\nYou know, the power of weaponry today is—and not only nuclear, but nuclear, in particular—the power of weaponry is very important. I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries. And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal, and we had the confines of a deal. We—we were—I thought we—he really wanted to do it and so did I—denuclearize. And it's so—it's such a beautiful term, when you think about it. In other words, to bring it down, because the power of those weapons is—is too great.\nAnd I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response. He's building a very strong nuclear power. He's not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon. I mean, he'll catch up over the period of 4 or 5 years, they say.\nBut it would be a great thing if we could—on a military basis, we're going to spend this year 900—let's say $915 billion on military. Russia, without the war, was spending close to a hundred, but with the war, I can't tell you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot. And China is spending $400- and $450 billion. We're over $900 billion. And I said, \"You know, it doesn't really make sense.\" I said, \"We're spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose if we got along.\" And I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen.\nFirst, when I left, as you know, 4 years ago, we didn't have Israel and the Middle East. We didn't have October 7—what a disaster—the disaster. Nothing was happening. Iran was not in—going to do anything, because Iran did not have much money at that point. They were broke. They were totally broke. They didn't have money for Hamas or for Hizballah. And you didn't have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened.\nBut now I come back, and I have—the whole world is on fire, so I have to put out the fires. But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China, and I'm going to meet with Russia, and we're going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down—military—especially as it pertains to nuclear.\nEverybody, thank you very much. Thank you very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nAnd I very much appreciate the Prime Minister visiting our great country, and I do really appreciate it. We have so much in common, and all we want to do is have peace, and we want to have strength, and we want to have lots of different things together, but the relationship with India and with the Prime Minister has never been better.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much.\nA great honor. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-india-0"}
{"Title": "Interview With Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel's \"Sean Hannity Show\"", "Date": "2025-02-14", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.\nThat's right. That's right.\nWell, I sued—I sued from long before he had it.\nAnd, I mean, they really did a number on me, you know. And I sued, and they had to pay. You know, they paid $10 million settlement.\n——it's a very low—I was looking to get much more money than that.\nHe got—oh, he got a big discount. I don't think he even knows about it.\nThat's the way he said that. You know, there's something nice about. [Laughter]\nIt is.\nDid I have a choice? [Laughter]\nI didn't have a choice.\nThat's the only thing I can say.\nThat speeded it up a little bit?\nNice. I didn't know that.\nSure.\nIt's true.\nOh, I see it all the time. They tried it, then they stopped. That wasn't—they have many different things of hatred. Actually, Elon called me. He said, \"You know they're trying to drive us apart.\" I said, \"Absolutely.\"\nYou know, they said: \"We have breaking news: Donald Trump has ceded control of the Presidency to Elon Musk. President Musk will be attending a Cabinet meeting tonight at 8 o'clock.\" [Laughter] And I say—it's just so obvious. They're so bad at it.\nI used to think they were good at it. They're actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, I'd never be President because I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me.\nI could do the greatest things; I get 98-percent bad publicity. I could do—outside of you and a few of your very good friends. It's, like, the craziest thing.\nBut you know what I have learned, Elon? The people are smart. They get it.\nThey get it. They really see what's happening.\nWell, I respect him. I've always respected him. I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I'm usually pretty good at this stuff. He did Starlink. He did things that were so advanced, and nobody knew what the hell they were.\nI can tell you, in North Carolina, they had no communication. They were wiped out. Those people were—you know, they had rivers in between—land that never saw water, all of a sudden, there was a river and a vicious—like, rapids. People were dying all over. They had no communication.\nThey said, \"Do you know Elon Musk?\" And they didn't really know I knew him. I said, \"Yeah.\" They said, \"Could you get Starlink?\" It's, like, the first time I ever heard of it. I said, \"What's Starlink?\" \"A communication system that's unbelievable.\"\nAnd he—yes. And he said—I called him, and I said, \"Listen, they really need it.\" And he got, like, thousands of units of this communication, and it saved a lot of lives. He got it immediately. And you can't get it. I mean, you have to wait a long time to get it. But he got it to him immediately.\nAnd I said, \"That's pretty amazing.\" And I didn't even know he had it.\nWe watch the rocket ships, and we watch Tesla. I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby. You grab your baby. It just——\nYes. No, but—and he said: \"You know, you can't really have a rocket program if you're going to dump a billion dollars into the ocean every time you fly. You have to save it.\" And he saved it. First time——\n——I've ever seen that done. Now nobody else can do it.\nIf you look at the U.S., Russia, or China, they can't do it, and they won't be able to do it for a long time. He has the technology. So you learn—I wanted somebody really smart to work with me, in terms of the country—a very important aspect. Because, I mean, he doesn't talk about it. He's actually a very good businessman. And when he talks about the Executive orders—and this is probably true for all Presidents: You write an Executive order and you think it's done, you send it out; it doesn't get done. It doesn't get implemented. They don't implement it.\nThey—maybe they're from the last administration—and they are, in some cases. You try and get them out as fast as you can. But I could—as soon as he said that, I said, \"You know, that's interesting.\" You write a beautiful Executive—and you sign it and you assume it's going to be done, but it's not. What he does is he takes it, and with his hundred geniuses—he's got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually——\n——they dress in just t-shirts. [Laughter] You wouldn't know they have 180 IQ.\nNo, no. He is——\nHe's much more than that.\nBut he gets it done. He's a leader. He really is a—he gets it done. You get a lot of tech people, and you have people, they're good with tech, but they—he gets it done.\nYou know, I said, in real estate, you had guys that would draw beautiful renderings of a building, and they'd draw the rendering, it would be great, and you'd say: \"Great. When are you starting?\" But they were never able to get it built. They couldn't get the financing. They couldn't get the approvals. It would never get done. And then you have other guys that are able to get it done. You know, they could just get it done.\nI was in real estate. Same thing in this. He gets it done.\nSo, when he said that—he said, \"You know, when you sign these Executive orders, a lot of them don't get done, and maybe the most important ones,\" and he would take that Executive order that I'd signed, and he would have those people go to whatever agency it was—\"When are you doing it? Get it done. Get it done.\" And some guy that maybe didn't want to do it, all of a sudden, he's signing—he just doesn't want to bother.\nYes, and they will. A lot of them will be. Yes.\nLook, in the meantime, we have 4 years. The beauty is, we have 4 years. That's why I like doing it right at the beginning. Because an Executive order is great. I mean, the one problem—it's both good and bad, because when they did all these Executive orders, I've canceled most of them. They were terrible. I mean, we were going to go radical left, Communist, okay? It was crazy. Their——\n——Executive orders were so bad, if they ever got them codified, you'd never be able to break them. So the damage that Biden has done to this country—and it's not even Biden; it's the people that circled him in the Oval Office, okay?—but the damage they did to this country, in terms of, let's say, open borders—you know, there's so many things, but open borders, where millions of people poured into our country, and hundreds of thousands of those people are criminals. They're murderers. They're drug dealers. They're gang members. They're people from prisons from all over the world.\nAnd we have a great guy, Tom Homan, and he is doing so incredibly. You saw the numbers. They're down like 96 percent.\nHe is a phenomenal guy. And Kristi Noem is doing an unbelievable job. And he wanted her. He said, \"She's so tough.\" And I said: \"I don't think of her as that way. You know, she's very nice.\" He said, \"No, she's so tough.\" And she is. I see her with the horses. She's riding the horse. Let's—[laughter]—she's great.\nBut the team we have is really unbelievable.\nBut those Executive orders, I sign them, and now they get passed on to him and his group and other people, and they're all getting done. We're getting them done.\nHe's going to go into orbit soon.\nNo, he's going to go to Mars. He's going to fly on his——\nAnd you like Bobby, right?\nYes.\nThat's why I became President.\nHe's good. You know, I wanted to find somebody smarter than him. I searched all over. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't. I couldn't.\nI couldn't find anyone smarter, right? So we had to—we had to, for the country.\nSo we settled on—we settled on this guy.\n[Laughter] Yes.\nAnd they're very committed people.\nWhen are you—when are you getting them?\nThey got left in space.\nBiden.\nWhen are they—when are you going to launch?\nAnd you have the go-ahead.\nYou now have the go-ahead.\nThey didn't have the go-ahead with Biden.\nHe was going to leave him in space. I think he was going to leave them in space.\nYes, he didn't want the publicity. Can you believe it?\nHe saved a lot of lives. In North Carolina, he saved a lot of lives.\nCalifornia. But, I mean, in North Carolina, where they were really in trouble, they had no communication, people were dying.\nThey were dying of starvation. He saved a lot of lives in North Carolina.\nYes. And my goal was to get great people. And when you look at what this man has done, I mean, it was something—I knew him a little bit through the White House. Originally, I'd see him around a little bit. I didn't know him before that, and I respected what he did. And he fought hard. You know, he was a—he was maybe questioned for a while. He was having some difficulties. It was not easy doing what he did.\nI mean, how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and made a better car where it's, you know, beating these big companies that that's all they do is cars? I mean, it's really amazing the things that he's done.\nBut I didn't know it as much then as now. I mean, the fruits have sort of taken hold.\nBut I wanted great people, and he's a great person. He's an amazing person. He's also a caring person. You know, he uses the word \"care.\"\nSo they sign a contract in a Government agency, and it has 3 months. And the guy leaves that signed the contract, and nobody else is there, and they pay the contract for 10 years.\nSo the guy is getting checks for years and years and years, and he's telling his family, obviously—maybe he was crooked, maybe he paid to get the contract, or maybe he paid that they didn't terminate him. But, you know, we have contracts that go forever, and they've been going for years, and they're supposed to end in 3 months or 5 months or 2 years or something, and they go forever. So the guy is either crooked—you know, where he knew this was going to happen—or he's crooked because he's getting payments that he knows he shouldn't be getting.\nBut they're finding things like that. They're finding things far worse than that. And they're finding billions—and it will be hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of fraud. I say waste and abuse, but fraud, waste, and abuse. And he's doing an amazing job.\nAnd he attracts a young, very smart type of person. I call them high-IQ individuals, and they are. They're very high Q and—high IQ. And when they go in to see the people and talk to these people—you know, the people think they're going to pull it over. They don't. These guys are smart, and they love the country. You know, there's a certain something.\nBut he uses the word \"care.\" So people have to care. Like, when I bought Air Force One——\n——I negotiated the price. It was $5.7 billion, and I got it—I got them down $1.7 billion. Now they're not building the plane fast enough. I mean, they're actually in default—Boeing. They're supposed to——\nThey've been building this thing forever. I don't know——\n——what's going on.\nWe don't build the way we used to build. You know, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is, like, a big deal, and we're going to get this country back on track. We could do it, but so many things—it takes so long to get things built and get things done.\nAnd a lot of it could be something we've been discussing. The regulators go in and they make it impossible to build. They make it very difficult to build anything, whether it's a ship, a plane, or a building or anything. And some of them do it because they want to show how important they are. Some of them do it maybe because they think they're right. They use the environment to stop progress and to stop things. It's always the environment. \"It's an environmental problem.\" It's not an environmental problem at all. But they do a lot of things.\nAnd by the way, speaking of that, Lee Zeldin is going to be fantastic in the position. So important. He could take 10 years to approve or disapprove something, or he could do it in a month. You know, just as good.\nAnd I think you're going to see some fantastic—a fantastic job done by him. He's a tremendous guy.\nThat's always the first thing they do.\n\"He's in violation of the Constitution.\" They don't even know what they're talking—well, they know.\nIt's just a con job. It's a big con job. And they're so bad for the country, so dangerous and so bad.\nAnd the media is so bad. When I watch MSNBC, which I don't watch much, but you have to watch the enemy on occasion, the level of arrogance and cheating and—they're just horrible people. These are horrible people.\nThese are horrible people.\nThey lie, and they start up with the Constitution. They couldn't care less about the Constitution.\nCNN, likewise. I mean, I watched them asking questions with, you know, the hatred with the—why—I said: \"What are you asking the question with such anger? You're asking me a normal question.\" But you see the bias. The bias is so incredible. Those two are bad.\nPBS is bad. AP is bad. CBS is terrible.\nI mean, CBS now—they changed an answer in Kamala. They asked her some questions. She answered them like, you know, a low-IQ person. The opposite of him—the absolute opposite. But she gave a horrible answer. They took the entire answer out, and they put another answer that she gave 20 minutes later into the—in—as the answer.\nI've never even heard of that before—I thought I heard of it all.\nNo, no. They took the entire—this long, terrible statement that she made and put another.\nNobody's ever seen what's happening. And you know, the people that do all this complaining, they're very dishonest people.\nYes.\nThat's right.\nBut we could take—we were talking about this yesterday. I could take—give me thousands of bills—any—I could pick any one of them, and I could——\n——take all thousand. And let's say it's a bill for $5,000—just $5,000, and it's done by some bureaucrat. And if he would say, \"I'll give you three. I don't want to pay you five. It's too high. I'll give you three.\" But they don't do that. If a guy sends in a bill for $5,000, they pay $5,000. They expect to be cut. Everybody expects to be cut. When you send in a bill, you expect to be cut. They send in the bill higher, for the most part. This is true with lawyers, legal fees. When they send in legal fees, you—I can cut—I wish I had the time, I would save so—but I could cut these bills in half—much better than half.\nBut you offer people a much lower number because you know they—they actually put fat—I'm not even saying it's—it's like a way of business. They put more on because they expect to be negotiated. When you send in a bill to the Government, there's nobody to negotiate.\nYou send it a bill for $10,000, and they send you a check back for $10,000. If you would call them and said, \"We'll give you five.\" \"No, no, no. I need more than five.\" \"We'll give you a five.\" \"I'm not going to pay any more than five.\" \"Make it six.\" \"No, I'm not going to make it six.\" And you'll settle for $5,500. You've just cut the bill almost in half, and it took, like, 2 minutes. When did that stop? But——\n——that's caring. No, it's not even the art of the deal. It's caring. He uses the word—\n——it's caring.\nIt's a certain competence, but I think it's more caring.\nAnd a lot of fraud, Sean. A lot of fraud.\nAnd a lot of kickbacks.\nThey're sending money out. They're not that stupid. These people aren't that stupid. They're sending for transgender—something having to do with the opera, and they're sending out $7 million—\n——$7 million. [Inaudible]\nNo, it's incredible.\nNo, but it's incredible: $7 million.\nNow, you know they—they're not so stupid. They're sending all this money. They expect to get a lot of it back. And that's what happens.\nThe one thing you didn't mention, the media. The media is getting millions of dollars.\n——you know, garbage magazine or program. I guess they have magazine, and they have some—some media of all types. $8 million.\nI hear the New York Times got a lot. I hear they get subscriptions—where they have subscriptions but maybe the paper is not sent. I have no idea if that's true or not, but it's—they call it subscriptions. Lots of subscription—to different media, not just the Times—maybe the Times, and maybe not the Times.\nWell—but millions of dollars going to media that's radical-left, crooked, dishonest media.\nThe FBI has to be rehabbed. The FBI——\nWhat's happened with the FBI and the DOJ is just—their stock has gone way down. I mean, their reputation is shot.\nAnd I think Pam is going to do great. I think Kash is going to do great. I think they have to do great or we have a problem.\nBut when you look at what they did, the raid of Mar-a-Lago—the raid of Mar-a-Lago—you look at what they did, their reputation is shot.\nTwo trillion—yes. We inherited it.\nYes. And inflation is back. I'm only here for 2½ weeks.\nNo, think of it, inflation is back. And they said, \"Oh, Trump inflation\"—I had nothing to do with it. These people have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent. They were given $9 trillion to throw out the window—$9 trillion, and they spent it on the green new scam, I call it. It's the greatest scam in the history of the country. One of them. We have a lot of them, I guess. But one of them.\n——it is.\nYes, yes.\nWell, that's all part of it. Yes.\nYou know, the amazing thing is, when you see, like, the teaching of DEI: $9 million. How do you spend $9 million to teach no matter what it is?\nYou could teach physics.\nYou could go to MIT for a lot less.\n——of DEI.\nNo, it's a kickback. It's got to be a kickback. Nobody is that—nobody could do that. Nobody is——\nNobody is giving—to assess the dialog of an audience coming out of a theater: $4 million.\nOne percent. [Laughter] No, because it's so massive. It's—this is——\n——huge money. Huge money. Look——\nAs good as they are, they're not going to find some contract that was crooked—you know, crooked as hell. And, I mean, there's going to be so much that isn't found. But what is found—I think he's going to find a trillion dollars.\nBut I think it's a very small percentage compared to what it is. I mean, he could tell you about treasuries; he could tell you about a woman that worked for Biden that became a very wealthy woman while she was working for him. Right?\nWhile they were working.\nSean, the saddest thing is they don't talk about the individual lines. I could go on your show right now, I could get a list that I have on the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, and it's got 40 points, and all they are is the heading of what this money is.\nYou don't have to go deep into it, and you see it's, you know, all different things and it's so ridiculous. I mean, normally, when you look for fraud, you're looking for one thing out of a hundred. Here, out of a hundred, 95 are going to be bad. I mean, they're—and they're so obvious just by the heading.\nBut they never mention that. They only mention: \"This is a violation of our Constitution. This is a\"—the word they give, you know, it's like a sound bite—\"constitutional crisis.\" It's a new thing, \"constitution\"—but they never mention about where the money is going.\nAnd when people hear that—I had a very smart man, John Kennedy—he's actually a very smart man. He said, \"Sir, you should just go on television and just read the name of the topic that you're giving all the money—just the topic that you're giving this money to, and don't say anything more,\" and he's right.\nBut they never talk about where the money is going. They just talk about, \"It's a constitutional crisis.\"\nIt's so sad. And honestly, I think they're bad people. I used to give them the benefit of the doubt, but you almost think they hate the country. I think they hate the country. They're sick people.\nThat's right. You know the good news, though? They've lost their confidence. They're not the same people.\nThey're not the same people. This election was brutal for them. We won every swing State. We won by millions and millions of votes. We won everything. We—all 50 States went up—all 50. It's never happened.\nEvery one. All 50 States went up.\nThey've lost their confidence. I see it. And they're just swirling and twirling. They don't know what the hell is happening. They're much different. They're just as mean, but they're not getting to the point.\nWell, the media—you're talking about the media.\nThe media—no, they're—you know, the anger that—they ask questions so angry—a question—a normal question. I give them an answer. They—but they—I say, \"Why are you so angry when you ask a question?\" Just a standard question. And, I don't know, there's something——\nYes.\nYes. Yes.\nI just—[inaudible]—so much and—and then Elon goes. But look, Social Security won't be touched——\n——other than if there's fraud or something—we're going to find it; it's going to be strengthened—but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched. It's just——\n[Inaudible]—don't have to.\nNow, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we're going to get them out of the system, and all of that fraud. But it's not going to be touched.\nSchool—I want to bring school back to the States, so that Iowa, Indiana—all these places—Idaho, New Hampshire—there's so many places, the States. I figure 35 really run well.\nAnd right now, it's Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, China—China, can you imagine?—has top schools. We're last.\nSo they have a list of 40 countries. We're number 40. Usually we're 38, 39, but last time, we were number 40. And what I say is you've got to give it back. So it doesn't work.\nI'll tell you what we're number one in: cost per pupil. We spend more money than any other country by far—it's not even close—per pupil. Okay? So, we know it doesn't work.\nSo we spend the most and we have the worst—right?—the worst result. When we give that—when we give that back to Indiana, when we give that back to Iowa and back to a lot of the States that run well—they run well, a lot of them—35, 37, 38—now, you're going to have 10 laggards, but you're going to have 5 real laggards, but that's going to be okay.\nTake New York—you give it to Westchester County, you give it to Suffolk County, you give it to Upstate New York, and you give it to Manhattan—but you give it to four or five subsections. Same thing in California. Los Angeles is going to be a problem, but you're going to give it to places that run well. We can change education\nNow, school choice is important, but that will get care—taken care of automatically.\nWe want to bring education back to the States. You will spend half the number.\nI'm not even—I'm not even doing this to save, but you will save. It will cost you much less money. You get a much better education.\nIf you go to some of these States, you'll be the equivalent of Norway, Sweden, Denmark—places that really have a good school system. You'll have—those places will be the equivalent, and your overall numbers will get so much better.\n——and arithmetic. Okay?\nOkay. A little science. You know——\n——you're not going to have much of a problem with that, but that's it.\n——the level. For what? To—I mean, for—what do they do?\nWe have really bad education—the teachers—I love teachers. I respect teachers. And, by the way, there's no reason why teachers can't form a union. They can do whatever they want to do, if it's back in the States. So we're not looking to hurt the teacher—I'm going to help the teachers. I think the teachers should be incentivized, because a good teacher is like a good scientist, is like a great doctor.\nIt's a valuable commodity.\nI think they should be incentivized.\nSo I'm totally for the teachers.\nRight.\nRight.\nBy the way, forms of that could be done.\nForms of that could be done.\nWe got hurt when we didn't get the vote on Obamacare. I made Obamacare—I had a choice: I could let it rot and win a point, or I could do the best you could do with it. And that's what I did. We did a great job with it, and we made it sort of work, but it's lousy. We could do so much better.\nAnd when you say—you go to certain areas, they have doctors round the clock. They have great medical care for a fraction of what we're paying right now.\nThere are things we could do. But look, just overall, this man has been so valuable. I hate to see the way they go after him. They go after him. It's so unfair. He doesn't need this. He wants to do this.\nFirst of all, this is bigger than anything he's ever done. He's done great companies and all, but this is much—you know, this is trillion—everything's trillions, right?\nHe'll never do anything bigger.\nYou have some States that operate that way. They operate as well as any corporation. They really operate well.\nThey have surpluses. They have—they don't——\nWhen they—when they look at New York and—and California and some of these places that should have an advantage—I mean, there's a big advantage—or Pritzker does such a bad job in Illinois; it's horrible how bad he is—and they don't have that advantage.\nYou know, New York has stock exchange and a lot of things. And California has the weather and the beautiful water and all the thing-—\nYes. [Laughter] But—but——\nBut some States operate the way he's talking about.\nWhen you go into some of these States, you're going to find very little. You're going to find almost nothing. They really operate well—big surpluses, low taxes. And——\nI—well, I did.\nIt was the right decision—in fact, Reagan tried to do it—because it rewards badly run States.\nBut at the same time, it's a tough—it was—it's tough for the States. I mean, it really is tough for the States. The sad part is, it rewards really badly run States.\nAnd Reagan tried to do it. He was unable to do it. I got it done.\nAnd now we're going to give some back.\nBecause you know what? We've got to help them.\nWe've got to help.\nNobody had any idea it would be that devastating. I did the right thing. I got something that Reagan couldn't do. I got it done, where everybody is—are the same. But you know what? We've got to help them out.\nRight.\nIt was Biden.\nAnd you know Biden wouldn't give him much.\nIt's—it's going to be, by the way. I really believe it's going to be.\nBecause the country is going to do well beside this. This is cutting. We're only talking about cutting.\nWe're also going to make a lot of money. We're going—we're taking in so much money.\nThen we won't let him do it.\nWe're not going to let him do it. He—if——\nHe's in certain areas—I mean, I see this morning—I didn't—I didn't know, but I said, \"Do the right thing\"—where they're cutting way back on the electric vehicle subsidies.\nThey're cutting back.\nYes.\nHe's probably not that happy with it, but that would have been one thing he would have come to me and said: \"Listen, you've got to do me a favor. This is crazy.\" [Laughter] But this was in the tax bill. They're cutting back on the subsidies.\nI didn't—I wasn't involved in it. I said, \"Do what's right, and you get\"—and they're coming up with the tax, but it's just preliminary.\nBut I mean, if he were involved, wouldn't you think he'd probably do that? Now, maybe he does better if you cut back on the subsidies. Who knows. Because he figures—he does think differently. He thinks he has a better product, and as long as he has a level playing field, he doesn't care what you do——\n——which he's very—he's told me that.\nIt's true.\nHe won't be involved.\nIf there's a conflict, he won't be involved.\nI mean, I wouldn't want that, and he won't want it.\nHe's—I know every businessman. I know the—the good ones, the bad ones, the smart ones, the lucky ones. I know them all. This guy is a very—he's a brilliant guy. He's a great guy. He's got tremendous imagination and scientific imagination—far beyond—you know, you keep talking about a technologist and all, but you're much more than a technologist. You are that. But he's also a good person. He's a very good person, and he wants to see the country do well.\nAnd I know a lot of great businesspeople, really great businesspeople, but, you know, they're not really, in some cases, very good people. And I know people that would try and take advantage of the situation.\nThis guy is somebody that really cares for the country, and I saw that very early on. I saw it, really, a long time ago when I got to know him. He's a very different kind of a character.\nThat's why—you know who loves him: young people that are very smart and that love the country. He's got, like, a tremendous following, because that's what he's—he's a good person.\nAnd he doesn't need this. He didn't need this, and he's doing this to help the country. If I didn't win this election, this country was—I don't think it could have made it. I don't—I mean, we're allowing criminals—millions of criminals into our country, where everything is transgender, it's men playing in women's sports.\nI mean, none of this stuff—you could go—I could give you a hundred things. It's almost like they're trying to destroy the fabric of the country, of the world, because the world was following us. Now the world is following us out of this pit.\nWe've done a lot. I'll tell you what, in 3 weeks, we've done more—I think we've done more—in terms of meaningful, not just dollars—than maybe any President ever. And a lot of people are saying that.\nI mean, if we can keep it going at this level, this country is going to be at a level that it's never seen before.\nTariffs/U.S. Trade Policy\nYes, reciprocal.\nEverybody. Everybody. Everybody but us.\nAnd I was doing it—you know, I charged China tariffs. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and I was doing that. But when we got—we had the greatest economy in history. But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it—and now I said, I want to come back and do the reciprocal—because every country in the world almost—we have a deficit with almost every country—not every one, but just about, pretty close.\nAnd—but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes—make it—it's impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don't know if that's true or not, but I think——\n——they don't want to—now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us. It's very unfair.\nAnd I said, \"You know what we do?\" I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday—he was here. I said: \"Here's what you do. We're going to do—be very fair with you.\" They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.\nOh, much—much higher.\nYes, that's peanuts. So much higher. And others too. I said: \"Here's what we're going to do: reciprocal. Whatever you charge, I'm charging.\" He goes, \"No, no, I don't like that.\" \"No, no, whatever you charge, I'm going to charge.\" I'm doing that with every country.\n[Laughter] It does.\nNobody can argue with me. You know, the media can't argue—I said—they said, \"Tariffs—you're going to charge tariffs?\" You know, if I said, like, 25 percent they'd say, \"Oh, that's terrible.\" I don't say that anymore——\n——because I say, \"Whatever they charge, we'll charge.\" And you know what?\nThey—then they say, \"Oh, that sounds fair.\"\nAnd we're going to make a lot of money, and a lot of businesses are going to come pouring in.\nThey do. Everybody needs us.\nAnd you know what?\nWe only have so long left where we're in this position. We're the bank, and the bank is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. We're the bank. We got to do this now. We can't wait another 10 years and have a shell of a country left, because that's what was going to happen.\nThis country—if I didn't win this election and have people like this man right here that really do care, because that's the other word—if you don't care, you could be the smartest guy in the world, it's not going to matter. But if we didn't win this election, I'm telling you, we would not have had a country for very long.\nWell, potentially, very quickly, between what he's doing and with income coming in from tariffs and other things. I mean, I hope we can—I don't want to give a date, because then these people are going to say, \"Oh, well, he didn't make the date.\" But I think we can do it very quickly.\nWe would have never done it if this didn't happen. Never. It would have never been—it would only get worse and worse, and ultimately, it would have exploded.\nThis country was headed down a very bad track. And the whole DEI thing, that was a trap. That was a sick trap.\nAnd you know, we've destroyed that. That's gone—that's pretty much gone.\nRight.\nEurope takes advantage of us.\nThere could be nothing bigger. There's nothing——\nThat's peanuts.\nThat's peanuts compared to what we're talking about.\nYes.\nIncluding his ships.\nIncluding his ships going up.\nNothing. There's nothing left.\nWell, he doesn't do this kind of thing. And the way I figured that you'd get to know him is if I did it with him. I said, \"Come on, let's do it together.\" He doesn't do this.\nI think he's smarter not doing it, overall. Because, you know, I mean, he's done very well without doing it. But he doesn't feel it's really worthwhile. He wants the product to speak for itself, or whatever he does speak for itself. But he views it as—you know, does it matter?\nAnd I'm doing this with you today because I wanted to have people understand him. And I think it's very important—I disagree with him. I think it's very important that they do understand him.\nHe doesn't need this. He doesn't need it. Now, I happen to think it's made him very popular. I think it—he's more popular now because there are so many people—you know, you're talking about the radical left—they have the lowest ratings. MSNBC is dying. CNN is dying. They're all dying. The New York Times is doing lousy. The Washington Post is doing horribly. They're all doing badly because people don't buy it anymore.\nBut I think it was important that he do this one interview. You've been a very fair guy. I think you were the right guy to do it. If we could get some radical left guy—and he'd do just as well, frankly, because it's all about common sense.\n——to me this was a—it was important for people to understand, he's doing a big job. He's doing a very thankless job. He's doing a thankless job, but he's helping us to save our country.\nOur country was in serious trouble, and I had to get the best guy, somebody with credibility, because if he were just a regular, good—very good, solid businessman, he wouldn't have the credibility. He's got the best credibility for this.\nAnd people also know he's an honest guy. He's an honest guy. He's just a very, very smart guy who's done amazing things. And this will be the biggest thing he's ever done, because, you know, his companies are all great. But if this country goes bad—I guess where he is a little selfish is this. He knows one thing and probably doesn't think—but if his—if this country goes bad, his stuff is not going to be worth very much, I can tell you.\nAll good statements.\nYou mean by that all good statements. Look, they respect the President of this country. They respect—they did not respect the last President. They laughed at him, and they laughed at our country, and he's done great damage to our country.\nYes, they have, but I'd rather not say. They have. It's not—it—look—\nHe was not George Washington, let's put it that way.\nNot the greatest.\nHe's done a tremendous disservice.\nActually, you mention John.\nHe's become the best voice in the Democrat party. You know, I had lunch with him, and I thought he was terrific, but he's a much different man than he was before he had this difficulty. He used to be radical left, and I think he became much smarter, actually. He's really—he's really a voice of reason.\nBut the Democrats have to get together. They have to get their act together, because the stuff they—they talk about makes no sense. It makes—none whatsoever. And they must know it. They must know.\nThat's a good question. I mean, I was thinking about that just now. I said, \"I wonder how long he's going to be doing it.\" You can't get somebody like this. He cares, and he's brilliant, and he's got energy.\nYou need energy, also, in addition to those other things.\nYou know, I have a lot of guys that are very smart, but they have no energy. They want to sleep all day long. You need a lot of energy. He's got a lot of energy. He's doing a great job.\nIf there's any conflict, he will stop it. But if he didn't, I'd stop it. I'd see if there's a conflict. I mean, we're talking about big stuff.\nBut he's under a pretty big microscope.\nI mean, everybody is watching him. If there's a conflict, you're going to be reading about it within about 2 minutes after the conflict.\nAnd you're going to ask the other side, when they talk about, \"This is a constitutional crisis,\" you've got to a—what are they paying for? Where are those tax—because when you read off the list of things, it's a big con job. See, when they talk Constitution——\n——it's a total con job.\n——and all the stuff in some country that nobody ever heard of, they don't want to talk about it. They just talk about, \"This is a constitutional crisis.\"\nThe money is being squandered purposely—tremendous theft, tremendous kickbacks, everything—and we're straightening it out. And thank goodness. I look up, and I say, \"Thank you,\" because I think if it went on for 4 more years, it would not be salvageable. You wouldn't be able——\nYou wouldn't be able to save it.\nYes.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-the-fox-news-channels-sean-hannity-show"}

{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France", "Date": "2025-02-24", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, everyone. Great honor to be here with my friend.\nI'm delighted to welcome President Macron back to the White House. We've been together quite often, but not that often in the White House. We honored the President, First Lady of France not so long ago. That was a beautiful evening, and we will not soon forget it. That was a beautiful day and evening and many fond memories.\nI also want to thank Emmanuel for hosting me in Paris last December after a historic election win to witness the reopening of the spectacular Notre Dame Cathedral, where you did an outstanding job in bringing it back together. That was a sad day, watching that burn. And 5 years later, you had it up, and it was, they say, more beautiful than it was before. So I think that's a great achievement. That was not easy.\nFrance is America's oldest ally. Our cherished partnership has been a force for freedom, prosperity, and peace from the very beginning. We're now working on some very interesting developments—one, in particular, as you know, the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nIn the American Revolution, French support helped us to seize our destiny as an independent nation. In the first and second World Wars, our citizens shed blood together on the battlefields of Europe. And I'll never forget joining President Macron 6 years ago on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. That was some day.\nThe purpose of our meeting today is to end another battle, a really horrible one—a war, something that we haven't seen since the Second World War—that is ravaging European soil. The deadliest and most destructive conflict that one can imagine. I've seen the pictures. I've seen the satellite photos and—and lots of other photos, and it's a horrible thing that's happening. Thousands of people are dying a week.\nThis very day is the third anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, which would never have happened if I was President. That was not going to happen. The horrors of this gruesome and bloody war can scarcely be overestimated. Hundreds of thousands of people—Russians and Ukrainians, in particular—have needlessly died. An entire generation of Ukrainians and Russian men has been decimated. One-thousand-year-old cities have been turned into rubble. Those beautiful spires that you used to see there—they were the most beautiful in the world, they say—are lying in heaps of rubble, blasted to smithereens.\nAnd it's time to end this bloodletting and restore peace, and I think we're going to do it. We've had some great conversations, including with Russia. Since my return to the White House, we've made more progress toward that goal in 1 month than occurred in the past 3 years.\nAnd I've spoken with both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. And, again, a lot of—a lot of good things toward peace are happening, moving it, I think, pretty quickly.\nLast week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff conducted successful talks in Saudi Arabia with the delegation from Russia, and I'd like to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the King and Muhammad. Great people. They're really working hard to get this done.\nOur focus is on achieving a cease-fire as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace. My meeting with President Macron today was another important step forward in that—well, that sphere, because he's been very much involved, right from the beginning, on trying to get it over with, and we're going to get it done.\nI believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues. Chief among them is, this is the right time. It may be the only time.\nYou know, that's a very interesting and horrible situation, and that could evolve into a third world war. We're not going to let that happen. It should have never started, but it did, and what a mess. What a horrible, bloody mess.\nI'm also pleased that President Macron agrees that the cost and burden of securing the peace must be borne by the nations of Europe, not alone by the United States. And Europe must take that central role in assuring long-term security of Ukraine, which they want to do. And that's not a very big step. A big step is what's going to happen over the next few weeks.\nThe United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other nation, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've spent more than $300 billion, and Europe has spent about $100 billion. That's a big difference. And at some point, we should equalize. But hopefully, won't—won't have to worry about that. We have other things happening that maybe take that out of the realm of necessity.\nAnd while we've given vast amounts of military aid and money in form of grants, much of Europe's contribution has been economic relief structured as loans, for which they'll be repaid. Like the Europeans, I believe that taxpayers and the United States also deserve to recoup the colossal amounts of money that we've sent. The previous administration never even thought of that. They didn't think of a lot of things, like why did they let it start in the first place.\nThat is why we must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress. I had a report just given to me before walking in that we've made, Emmanuel, a great deal of progress toward getting that.\nI've been elected by the American people to restore common sense to Washington and, indeed, to the world. And I believe strongly that it's in the best interest of the United States, the best interest in Europe, the best interest of Ukraine, and indeed, the best interest of Russia to stop the killing now and bring the world to peace.\nMy administration is making a decisive break with the foreign policy failures of the past administration and, frankly, the past. I ran against a very foolish foreign policy establishment, and their recklessness has led to the death of many, many people.\nUnder our administration, we're forging a new path that promotes peace around the world. And when I left office for the first administration—first term, we had no wars. We had no problems. We didn't have October 7 with Israel. We didn't have Russia and Ukraine going at it. We didn't have the problems in other parts of the Middle East. We didn't have inflation. It was a whole different world.\nAnd you know what else we didn't have? Millions of people pouring through our borders, many of them criminals released from other nations and put right into our land: murderers and drug dealers, gangs. We didn't have any of that. It's a different time.\nBut now we have it, and we're fixing it. We'll fix it all up. We'll get it done as quickly as possible.\nAnd we've made a great deal of progress. People are saying it was the best month for a President in our country's history. I hope that's right, but—I feel it's right. We've—we've done a lot of things in a very short period of time, 4 weeks.\nAs I've said before, it's my hope that my greatest legacy, however, will be as a peacemaker and a unifier. I want to bring peace, not war.\nI thank President Macron for joining us today in this urgent work we're doing. And we have some wonderful people up front right here that have worked so hard. Steve Witkoff, thank you very much. Michael Waltz, thank you. Scott, thank you very much. And, J.D., thank you. They've really done a—they've really done a job. They worked very hard. It's like—it's a real passion to get this war ended.\nAnd I'd like to now invite Emmanuel to say a few words, and then we'll take questions. And, again, Emmanuel, it's a great honor to have you with us at the White House. Thank you very much. Please.\nThank you very much. Thank you, Emmanuel. Thank you very much.\n[President Macron spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nGreat job.\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nBrian [Brian Glenn, America's Real Voice], would you like to ask a question? Go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, I was honored by it. It was a big poll, and it's usually a poll that leans on the other side of things, the other side of the world, so to speak. But the Harvard poll is a respected poll, and it has us not only leading, but leading by a lot and leading on every single issue that we've talked about.\nAnd as I said, we've become the party of common sense, and I think that's a very important element now—common sense—because what's happening in the world and even in this country, some of the things that took place, many of them are now canceled, and the rest are being canceled as we speak. But we've moved very rapidly and, I think, very effectively.\nSo I was honored by that poll. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nGo ahead. Please go ahead.\nRussia/Ukraine/U.S. Diplomatic Efforts in Saudi Arabia\nYes.\nGo ahead.\nYes, I think the meeting in Saudi Arabia was a fantastic one. We met with the Crown Prince, who is just a fantastic young guy. He's young, but with great imagination and tremendously respected all over the world. And he goes right to the King, and the King is incredible. I've gotten to be friends with both of them very much. And they want to see this ended, and they're going all out to make sure that it is ended.\nI think Russia, likewise—I've spoken to President Putin, and my people are dealing with him constantly and his people, in particular. And they want to do something. I mean, that's what I do. I do deals. My whole life is deals. That's all I know is deals. And I know when somebody wants to make it and when somebody doesn't.\nI will say this. Before I came here, there was no communication with Russia whatsoever, and Russia wasn't answering calls. They were not talking to anybody. They wouldn't talk to anybody. And people sort of accepted that as being that they want to go forward and just keep going without stop. But when I got here, one of the first calls I made was to President Putin, and we were treated with great respect.\nAnd they want to end this war. So that's a big thing, because I didn't know if I could say that, but it's a big thing. They want to do it. And the group in the front row that I introduced, they are very—all very active in it. And we're working on deals right now, transactions right now.\nAnd, in particular, the big one is to get the—the war stopped, whether it's ceasefire or direct to an agreement. I'd like to go directly to an agreement, but cease-fire will always happen a little bit quicker. And every day, you're saving thousands or at least hundreds—but thousands, in some cases—lives, so we want to see if we can get that done very quickly.\n[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nYes, for the President, please.\nYes. I think it's very much to the benefit of Russia to make a deal, and I feel that we'll do that. It is what it is.\nAgain, it's a war that should have never been started. It's a war that would not have been started if I were President, but it did start, and it's at a terrible level, where cities are burned down and shot down to the ground. It looks like demolition sites, a whole big pile of demolition sites. And we got to get it stopped. Too many people, too much agony. The whole culture is destroyed, when you rip down some of those ancient—really ancient or near-ancient buildings. It's so sad to see.\nBut I think it's very much to the benefit of—there's tremendous distrust on both sides. That's why it's good that I'm coming in now. But I think it's to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with—go on with leading Russia in a very positive way. That's what you have to do.\nBut I really believe that he wants to make a deal. May be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.\n[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nWe're on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that's moving along very rapidly. We've been mistreated very badly by many countries, not just Canada and Mexico. We've been taken advantage of. We were led by, in some cases, fools, because anybody that would sign documents like they signed, where they were able to take advantage of the American people, like has happened over the last long period of time, except for a little 4-year period that took place 4 years ago—but anybody that would agree to allow this to happen to our country should be ashamed of themselves.\nNo, the tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule. This is an abuse that took place for many, many years. And I'm not even blaming the other countries that did this. I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. I mean, you know, who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States, took advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything? Every aspect that you can imagine, they took advantage of. I look at some of these agreements, I'd read them at night, and I'd say, \"Who would ever sign a thing like this?\"\nSo the tariffs will go forward, yes. And we're going to make up a lot of territory. We're going to—all we want is reciprocal. We want reciprocity. We want to have the same. So, if somebody charges us, we charge them. It's very simple. But it will be very good for our country. Our country will be extremely liquid and rich again.\nPlus, we're doing other things, as you know. We're finding tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse at levels that nobody thought possible. You're seeing what's going on.\nAnd that was also part of the Harvard poll: Do you agree with what President Trump is doing with Elon and others that are looking for the waste, fraud, and abuse? And the numbers were staggering. It was, like, 70 percent to 2 percent. Everybody wants to find out. They don't like it.\nAnd you know, the radical left or whoever it may be starts screaming about the Constitution, but it has nothing to do with the Constitution. It has to do with fairness to this country. It has to do with being ripped off. And when you read the things that all of these billions and—and I mean many billions, hundreds of billions of dollars—has—have been spent on, that's all you have to do is stand up here and read them. I could stand up all day and read the kind of things where we're spending all of this money.\nThe good news is that when you think of how rich a nation we can be when we get rid of this. You know, sometimes you'll buy a company, and you'll see it was really well run. It's—they accounted for every penny. Well, not much you can do there. You've got yourself a bad deal. This one is the exact opposite. Tremendous fraud, tremendous waste. And—when you think of what it is—you know, Elon uses an expression, \"caring.\" If we had people that cared, just cared a little bit when they did contracts, when they negotiated with outside vendors for—on behalf of the United States.\nThat's what I'm doing now. I'm negotiating for the people of the United States. So, we're doing a great job of it, I will say. We've found—it will be hundreds of billions of dollars of—of waste and fraud and abuse.\nThank you. Please.\n[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]\nOkay. Please. Go ahead. To the President, please.\nUkraine/U.S. Security Assistance/Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France\nWell, I guess it's a little strange question, because you ask whether or not we're going to, on behalf of the United States, contribute to Ukraine. I mean, we're in there for about $350 billion. I think that's a pretty big contribution.\nI do appreciate the first part of your question, however, because I think they've done an incredible job with the Cathedral of Notre Dame. I think the President has done—I know he headed it up, and I know he—how hard he worked, and it took a period of time but really not a long period of time, considering what that was. So delicate, so beautiful.\nAnd I was there, and I saw the work. And I'm very good at construction. I know good construction, and I know bad construction. They did a beautiful job, and this man has to be given a lot of credit for that. It's an incredible cathedral. Most people thought it couldn't be saved, and, if it was, it would have to be built in a different form. And we didn't want to see a different form. We wanted to see the same form that you built.\nSo I just want to congratulate you. That was an amazing job. I don't think you've gotten enough credit for it. Someday you will. Someday you will.\nEmmanuel, thank you very much. Great job. And it's been wonderful being with you.\nSay hello to your beautiful wife, and we will see you again soon. We'll be speaking often, and we'll get this thing worked out. We're going to get it done. So important. And great job.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom", "Date": "2025-02-27", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great honor.\nToday, it's my privilege to welcome the Prime Minister of a very special place, the United Kingdom, to the White House. Prime Minister Starmer, you've been terrific in our discussions. You're a very tough negotiator, however. [Laughter] I'm not sure I like that, but that's okay. [Laughter] Very, very special person.\nThe Prime Minister and I have gotten off to an outstanding start. The U.S. and U.K. have a special relationship—very special; really, like no other—passed down through the centuries, and we're going to keep it that way. We're going to keep it very strong, as it is.\nVery importantly, I was just notified by letter from King Charles that he's extended, through the Prime Minister, a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom, and that's a great honor because it's never happened before. One person has never been extended that honor, and I really do call it an honor. But it's not for me. It's for our country. It's respect for our country. So I just want to thank you, and I want to thank King Charles. Thank you very much.\nAnd we accept. [Laughter] I don't know if the media is going to follow us. I have a feeling they might. Okay? Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nI'm pleased to say that the bust of one of the Prime Minister's greatest predecessors, Winston Churchill, is now back in the rightful place in the Oval Office, and we're very proud of it.\nOur meeting today and the various breakout sessions we had were tremendously productive. Most importantly, I provided the Prime Minister with an update on our efforts to end the bloody and horrible war in Ukraine with Russia, which would never have happened if I were President— that was not going to happen. I promise you that.\nAfter 3 years of hellacious conflict, approximately 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been senselessly killed. But the number, I believe, is much higher than that. Countless schools, hospitals, towns, and beautiful ancient churches have been absolutely obliterated.\nTo begin the process of ending this spiral of death, I had historic back-to-back calls with President Putin—very successful calls, I might add—and President Zelenskyy, and my team also spoke with the Secretary General of NATO on numerous occasions, and we're working very hard to get that war brought to an end. I think we've made a lot of progress, and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly.\nAnd I want to thank all of the people that are here that have been working on it, and we'll let you know what's—what happens. It will either be fairly soon, or it won't be at all.\nIn addition, this week, I met with President Macron of France, as you know, and held talks with members of the G-7.\nTomorrow the progress toward peace will continue when President Zelenskyy visits the White House. He'll be here tomorrow in the early part of the day, and we'll be signing a historic agreement that will make the United States a major partner in developing Ukraine's minerals and rare earths and oil and gasses. And we have a great understanding. I think it's going to be great for Ukraine.\nAnd we're going to be at the site, and we'll be digging. We'll be dig, dig, digging. Dig, we must. A big utility in New York, Con Edison, they used to have a saying, \"Dig we must.\" And we will be digging.\nBut much of the European aid to Ukraine has been sent in the form of loans, for which they expect to be paid back, and we didn't have that honor under the Biden administration. He sent money—would just send it, money after money after money—and never had any knowledge of ever seeing it back: maybe 300 to 350 billion dollars.\nBut under the breakthrough agreement, very unusual, which everyone said was difficult to get—but it's really very good for Ukraine and very good for us—the American taxpayers will now effectively be reimbursed for the money and hundreds of billions of dollars poured into helping Ukraine defend itself, which, by and of itself, is a very worthy thing to do.\nWe've paid far more than any other country, and with most of our support, it's been paid in military—the finest weapons anywhere in the world. This includes vast amounts of military hardware, ammunition, and various other things that we now have to start rebuilding our own stockpiles.\nAdditionally, the minerals agreement will provide the basis for a more sustainable future relationship between the United States and Ukraine and thus stimulate the long-term prosperity that will help the Ukrainians rebuild their country. It's been demolished, and the ruined infrastructure—the infrastructure, as you know, is in very bad shape.\nIn just over 1 month, our administration has already achieved more progress toward peace than years in the other administration, where they did nothing toward peace. They didn't understand what was happening.\nOur approach is basically common sense. As I said, so many of the things that we do are based on common sense. If you want peace, you have to talk—both sides.\nAs I discussed with Prime Minister Starmer, the next step we're making is toward a very achievable cease-fire. We hope that that can happen quickly, because thousands of young people—in this case, they—we're not talking about Americans; we're talking about Ukrainians and Russians—are being killed every week. Thousands.\nAnd it's a rough battlefield. It's a flat piece of land, and the bullet only stops when it hits somebody.\nAnd this week, I saw the reports, and it's—I don't even want to say what they are, but thousands of people—young people—young, vibrant people died. And we want to stop that senseless—should have never happened.\nThis will lay the groundwork for a long-term peace agreement that will return stability to Eastern Europe and, hopefully, ensure that such a terrible war will never happen on European soil or, for that matter, anywhere again. It's a horrible thing that's going on.\nThe disaster in Ukraine shows exactly why it's so important for the United Kingdom and other NATO partners to make large investments in their defense capabilities. In many cases, 4 percent or 5 percent of GDP would be appropriate. I know that they're raising it. I just read an article, a great article about the work you're doing in the U.K., as to the military. You're raising it quite a bit, which is a great thing to do for your country.\nIt's great thing to do. It's sad that we need that, but probably need that. So, congratulations on that. I know you got it through.\nAfter years of chronic underfunding, there's an urgent need to catch up for some countries. And I want to thank the Prime Minister once again for traveling here today. Working together, I believe that we'll once again demonstrate the power of our countries' unique friendship. This is indeed a unique friendship. It's been many years, and I think it's only gotten stronger, and we will make sure that it stays that way.\nWe're going to have a great trade agreement. One way or the other, we're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both countries, and we're working on that as we speak. I think we'll have the confines—I think we'll have something maybe even in terms of possibilities agreed to very shortly. J.D. is working on it, our Vice President, and Scott. And I'm just looking at this whole—Mike, you're going to work on it. Everyone's going to work on it. We'll see if we can do something pretty quickly.\nBut we're going to make some great trade agreements with the U.K. and with the Prime Minister, and it'll happen very quickly.\nSo I just want to thank you again. And please thank King Charles for the invite, and I look forward to you giving our acceptance on behalf of the United States of America. Thank you very much, sir.\nThank you very much.\nGreat. Great to see you.\nThank you.\nThat's right.\nThank you very much. What a beautiful accent. [Laughter] I would have been President 20 years ago if I had that accent. [Laughter]\nThank you. Very good to see you.\nWe'll take a couple of questions.\nSo I'll go ahead—the first part. The tariffs are necessary because we've been treated very unfairly by many, many countries, including our friends—friend and foe. But we've been treated very unfairly in trade at levels that nobody has really ever seen before. And especially under the Biden administration, they really took advantage of the United States.\nI put massive tariffs on China during my 4 years. We had the best economy in the history of our country. One—probably the best economy—maybe the best economy in the history of the world. And I had—I used tariffs to even things up. And in particular, with China, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars. And we had no inflation.\nAnd it's a myth. It's a myth that's put out there by foreign countries that really don't like paying tariffs and—especially to even up. So we've been treated badly by a lot. We're using tariffs.\nAnd I find—and you just have to look at the numbers, but I find that it's not about inflation; it's about fairness. And the inflation, for us, has not existed, and I don't think it's going to exist.\nWe're going to bring our car industry back. We're going to bring our chips back. We're going to bring so many things back to our country, including pharmaceuticals and drugs.\nAnd the thing that's going to get us there is tariffs. And I say often it's my favorite word in the dictionary, but I always preface that by saying now—because I got into a lot of trouble with the fake news where they say, \"That's not good.\" So I say, God, love, family, wife, they're all my favorite words—[laughter]—but tariff is about number four or five on the list. [Laughter]\nBut I will tell you, it's going to make our country rich, and it's going to stop us from being a laughing stock all over the world, because we have been taken advantage of like no country has ever been taken advantage of.\nThank you very much. And—[inaudible]—answer.\nThat's enough. Thank you.\nHi.\nWell, they didn't do well with President Obama. He never got a lot of things done, and he didn't get a trade deal done that was of any importance or magnitude. We have—we've had great discussions on trade, and I think we're going to have a deal done rather quickly—as quickly as it can be done. We'll—we're going to have something, I think, rather quickly. We expect to do that. Okay?\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.\nI support it. I don't think we're going to have any reason for it. I think we're going to have a very successful peace, and I think it's going to be a long-lasting peace. And I think it's going to happen, hopefully, quickly. It—if it doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\nAnd we want it for two reasons. Number one, I want to see—on a humane basis, I want to see soldiers stop getting shot, because, largely, it's soldiers now. Towns have been obliterated. But it's largely that.\nAnd I don't want to pay billions and billions and billions of dollars, nor does the Prime Minister or anybody else, on a senseless war that should have never happened. And we're going to get it taken care of. But I think it's going to be a peace that's going to be long-lasting.\nDo you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nOkay. Please, blue.\nWell, we're never going to know that answer but by our being in Ukraine and doing the exploration and also the digging and taking the rare earth, which we need in our country very badly. We'll be doing a substantial amount of work, probably about—at least what we have in there, and we hope to be able to do that.\nYou never know when it comes to that. You know, you dig, and maybe things aren't there like you think they're there. But we'll be spending a lot of time there. It will be great for Ukraine. It's like a huge economic development project. So it will be good for both countries. Okay?\nAnd I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow—11 o'clock. And I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. We're going to get along really well. Okay? We have a lot of respect. I have a lot of respect for him.\nWe've given them a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure. They have really fought. Somebody has to use that equipment, and they have been very brave in that sense.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nSo we're working very hard on the Middle East and Gaza and all of the problems, and it's been going on for years and years and centuries and centuries. It's a— tough neighborhood, but it could be a very beautiful neighborhood, and I think we're going to come up with some pretty good solutions.\nBut phase one is almost complete. We've had some people that have been very seriously injured, very seriously hurt—both physically and mentally. They've come out of there very, very—and some of them in very, very bad shape. It's shocking—many young people. Young people aren't in bad shape. Young people are strong, healthy. They don't die. People have come out dead—young people and old people.\nIt's a rough situation, but I think we're going to make it much better. And I think that we've had a huge impact on that since we've been in just the 4 weeks. I think we've had a huge impact on Gaza, the Middle East, and we have some pretty good talks going on, concerning lots of other people that are going to make it better.\nSo we'll see what happens. Nobody really knows, but we'll see what happens. But I think we've had a very positive impact.\nThank you. Yes, in the red, please.\nPink-red. Flaming red.\nGo ahead.\nYes, thank you very much. We're open to many things, but before I even think about that—that's almost pleasant to think about, because that would mean that peace has been arrived at. We have to arrive at that peace.\nAnd you know, you went 3½ years with an administration that never even really had a meeting—they didn't have a meeting on peace, and there was no prospect of peace.\nI think, frankly, Russia wanted to go through the whole long deal. I don't think they do anymore. I don't think they do. We had a very big impact on that whole situation.\nBut I don't like talking about phase two until I get phase one. Phase one is, I have to make peace. And we have to get Russia to agree. We have to get Ukraine to agree. And I think we will. I think we've come a long way. I believe we're going to get it done. I wouldn't say that if I didn't think so. And I think it will be very important, very historic, and we're going to save a lot of lives.\nAnd think of that, she came home with her fingers and part of her hand blown off.\nYes. How bad does it get? And we had others that came home in much, much worse shape than that.\nIt's a terrible situation.\nHe tried. [Laughter] He was working hard, I'll tell you that. [Laughter] He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there. [Laughter] But he tried.\nWe—I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\nBut he's—he earned whatever they—whatever they pay him, he earned today. He was working hard at lunch. [Laughter] And I'm very receptive to it.\nI think we—in all fairness, in all seriousness, I think we have a very good chance at arriving in a very good deal. J.D. and—Scott and Howard—all the people are working on it, and I think we have a good chance at arriving at a deal that could be terrific—really terrific for both countries.\nOkay? Thank you.\nI think we'll have two deals. I think we'll have a deal on ending the war, and I think we're going to end up with a great trade deal with you.\nAnd it's an honor to be with you.\nAnd I want to thank everybody very much. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-keir-starmer-the-united-kingdom"}
