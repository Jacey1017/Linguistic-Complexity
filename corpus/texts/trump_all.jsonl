{"Title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio", "Date": "2016-07-21", "Text": "Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\nI have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end.\nBeginning on January 20th of 2017, safety will be restored.\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week. Go there.\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\nThese are the facts:\nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration's rollback of criminal enforcement.\nHomicides last year increased by 17 percent in America's fifty largest cities. That's the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation's capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore.\nIn the President's hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone. And almost 4,000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Number one in her class. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\nI've met Sarah's beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn't worth protecting. No more. One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?\nAgain, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are now not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone. We're going to fix that.\nThe budget is no better.\nPresident Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. And yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. One after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.\nThis was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing.\nIn Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America's foreign policy.\nLet's defeat her in November, OK.\nI am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today. Let's review the record.\nIn 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a big, big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control.\nAfter four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos. Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.\nBut Hillary Clinton's legacy does not have to be America's legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place. A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect, the respect we deserve.\nThe American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation's most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit. Believe me, it's for their benefit.\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\nThat is why Hillary Clinton's message is that things will never change...never ever. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\nI have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. And they are forgotten, but they're not going to be forgotten long. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\nI am your voice!\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good.\n[disruption in the audience]\nHow great are our police? And how great is Cleveland?\nI have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\nWhen innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way, and I won't look the other way.\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can't see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country.\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was \"extremely careless\" and \"negligent,\" in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes.\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less, have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers, I know the time for action has come.\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.\nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs, and strip us of our wealth as a country. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana. And a great guy.\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana, which is amazing. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and three were very very badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order to our country. Believe me, believe me.\nI will work with, and appoint, the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done. In this race for the White House, I am the law and order candidate.\nThe irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen.\nThis Administration has failed America's inner cities. Remember: it has failed America's inner cities. It's failed them on education. It's failed them on jobs. It's failed them on crime. It's failed them at every level.\nWhen I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore, in Chicago, in Detroit, in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child.\nTo make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS, and we are going to defeat them fast.\nOnce again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism. Men, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee. And many, many other locations.\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and we're going to stop it.\nAs your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me.\nAnd as a Republican, it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said. Thank you.\nTo protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\nWe must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now, doing it quickly. We're going to win. We're going to win fast.\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel.\nRecently I have said that NATO was obsolete, because it did not properly cover terror, and also, that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share. As usual, the United States has been picking up the cost. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction.\nLastly, and very importantly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place. We don't want them in our country.\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this. Think of this. This is not believable, but this is what's happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there's no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from.\nI only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people. Anyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be.\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and my friend Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border, which we can solve. We have to solve it.\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain, believe me. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, and Sabine, and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh, it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so so horribly?\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate.\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America's Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful, lawful, lawful immigration system. Lawful.\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. We will stop it. It won't be happening very much anymore. Believe me. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say.\nOn January 20th of 2017, the day I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.\nBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens.\nU.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nMy plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.\nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that they're going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class.\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat, of which there are many. It's been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I'm going to make our country rich again. Using the richest people in the world, which our country has, I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or, frankly, any other country.\nNever, ever again.\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences. Not going to happen anymore.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband's colossal mistakes and disasters.\nShe supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. And it's not going to happen. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. I will never, ever sign bad trade deals. America fist, again! America first! Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.\nNo longer will we enter into these massive transactions, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.\nThis includes stopping China's outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we'll walk away if we don't get the deal that we want.\nWe are going to start building and making things again.\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief, and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone, and I mean everyone.\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Believe me, it will happen, and it will happen fast. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it very very quickly. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.\nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President. Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\nThis new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\nMy opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children. And that's what she's doing, and that's what she's done. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!\nThank you. Thank you.\nWe are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives.\nWe will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.\nWe will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support. We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying.\nMy opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I'm going to do it.\nWe are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\nThe replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies. Very important. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because I'll tell you what, the support they have given me, and I'm not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight. So true. They have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits. An amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views. Their voice has been taken away.\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. Start believing. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. And by the way, Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he'd say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight.\nIt's because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. I love those people.\nThen there's my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character. She could pick 'em out from anywhere.\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.\nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It's time to deliver a victory for the American people. We don't win anymore, but we are going to start winning again. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\nRemember: All of the people telling you that you can't have the country you want, are the same people that wouldn't stand -- I mean, they said Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight. Not a chance! The same people. Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we? Love it, love it, love it. No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place. Instead, we must choose to Believe In America.\nHistory is watching us now.\nIt's waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong. I'm asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House.\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: \"I'm With Her\". I choose to recite a different pledge.\nMy pledge reads: \"I'M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.\"\nI am your voice.\nSo to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\nTo all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise:\nWe Will Make America Strong Again.\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\nGod bless you, and good night! I love you!", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-cleveland"}
{"Title": "Inaugural Address", "Date": "2017-01-20", "Text": "Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: Thank you.\nWe, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come. We will face challenges, we will confront hardships, but we will get the job done.\nEvery 4 years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Thank you.\nToday's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people.\nFor too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of Government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\nThat all changes, starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment: It belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country.\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our Government, but whether our Government is controlled by the people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this Nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now.\nYou came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge; and the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\nThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one Nation, and their pain is our pain, their dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.\nThe oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\nFor many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military. We've defended other nations' borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world.\nBut that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.\nWe, assembled here today, are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first.\nEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families.\nWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never, ever let you down.\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\nWe will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful Nation.\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.\nWe will seek friendship and good will with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example—we will shine—for everyone to follow.\nWe will reinforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, \"How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity.\" We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear: We are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement, and most importantly, we will be protected by God.\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.\nWe will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining, but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.\nDo not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\nIt's time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American flag.\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\nSo to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\nTogether, we will make America strong again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again.\nAnd, yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you. God bless America.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/inaugural-address-14"}
{"Title": "Interview with David Muir of ABC News' \"World News Tonight\"", "Date": "2017-01-25", "Text": "Thank you very much, David.\nIt has periodically hit me. And it is a tremendous magnitude. And where you really see it is when you're talking to the generals about problems in the world. And we do have problems in the world. Big problems. The business also hits because the -- the size of it. The size.\nI was with the Ford yesterday. And with General Motors yesterday. The top representatives, great people. And they're gonna do some tremendous work in the United States. They're gonna build plants back in the United States. But when you see the size, even as a businessman, the size of the investment that these big companies are gonna make, it hits you even in that regard. But we're gonna bring jobs back to America, like I promised on the campaign trail.\nGood.\nCorrect.\nUltimately it'll come out of what's happening with Mexico. We're gonna be starting those negotiations relatively soon. And we will be in a form reimbursed by Mexico which I will say --\nYeah, absolutely, 100 percent.\nAll it is, is we'll be reimbursed at a later date from whatever transaction we make from Mexico. Now, I could wait a year and I could hold off the wall. But I wanna build the wall. We have to build the wall. We have to stop drugs from pouring in. We have to stop people from just pouring into our country. We have no idea where they're from. And I campaigned on the wall. And it's very important. But that wall will cost us nothing.\nDavid, he has to say that. He has to say that. But I'm just telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form. And you have to understand what I'm doing is good for the United States. It's also going to be good for Mexico.\nWe wanna have a very stable, very solid Mexico. Even more solid than it is right now. And they need it also. Lots of things are coming across Mexico that they don't want. I think it's going to be a good thing for both countries. And I think the relationship will be better than ever before.\nYou know, when we had a prisoner in Mexico, as you know, two years ago, that we were trying to get out. And Mexico was not helping us, I will tell you, those days are over. I think we're gonna end up with a much better relationship with Mexico. We will have the wall and in a very serious form Mexico will pay for the wall.\nWell, I'd say very simply that they are going to pay for it. I never said they're gonna pay from the start. I said Mexico will pay for the wall. But what I will tell my supporters is, \"Would you like me to wait two years or three years before I make this deal?\" Because we have to make a deal on NAFTA. We have to make a new trade deal with Mexico because we're getting clobbered.\nWe have a $60-billion trade deficit. So, if you want, I can wait two years and then we can do it nice and easily. I wanna start the wall immediately. Every supporter I have -- I have had so many people calling and tweeting and -- and writing letters saying they're so happy about it. I wanna start the wall. We will be reimbursed for the wall.\nAs soon as we can. As soon as we can physically do it. We're --\nI would say in months. Yeah, I would say in months. Certainly planning is starting immediately.\nWe'll be having some really good, really solid plans within a short period of time.\nThey shouldn't be very worried. They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border. We're gonna have a very solid border. Where you have great people that are here that have done a good job, they should be far less worried. We'll be coming out with policy on that over the next period of four weeks.\nI'm gonna tell you over the next four weeks. But I will tell you, we're looking at this, the whole immigration situation, we're looking at it with great heart. Now we have criminals that are here. We have really bad people that are here. Those people have to be worried 'cause they're getting out. We're gonna get them out. We're gonna get 'em out fast. General Kelly is -- I've given that as his number one priority.\nWe're gonna be talking with -- attorney general. He will soon be the attorney general. He's done fantastically well. We're all very proud of him. I thought he was treated very, very unfairly. He's a brilliant man and he's a very good man. He'll do a fantastic job. I'll be speaking to him as soon as he's affirmed.\nWe will be talking to the attorney general.\nSo, let me tell you first of all, it was so misrepresented. That was supposed to be a confidential meeting. And you weren't supposed to go out and talk to the press as soon as you -- but the Democrats viewed it not as a confidential meeting.\nSure. And I do -- and I'm very --\n-- and I mean it. But just so you -- it was supposed to be a confidential meeting. They turned it into not a con -- Number two, the conversation lasted for about a minute. They made it -- somebody said it was, like, 25 percent of the -- It wasn't. It was hardly even discussed.\nI said it. And I said it strongly because what's going on with voter fraud is horrible. That's number one. Number two, I would've won the popular vote if I was campaigning for the popular vote. I would've gone to California where I didn't go at all. I would've gone to New York where I didn't campaign at all.\nI would've gone to a couple of places that I didn't go to. And I would've won that much easier than winning the electoral college. But as you know, the electoral college is all that matters. It doesn't make any difference. So, I would've won very, very easily. But it's a different form of winning. You would campaign much differently. You would have a totally different campaign. So, but --\n-- you're just asking a question. I would've easily won the popular vote, much easier, in my opinion, than winning the electoral college. I ended up going to 19 different states. I went to the state of Maine four times for one. I needed one.\nI went to M-- I got it, by the way. But it turned out I didn't need it because we ended up winning by a massive amount, 306. I needed 270. We got 306. You and everybody said, \"There's no way you get to 270.\" I mean, your network said and almost everybody said, \"There's no way you can get to ...\" So, I went to Maine four times. I went to various places. And that's the beauty of the electoral college. With that being said, if you look at voter registration, you look at the dead people that are registered to vote who vote, you look at people that are registered in two states, you look at all of these different things that are happening with registration. You take a look at those registration for -- you're gonna s-- find -- and we're gonna do an investigation on it.\nWell, we're gonna find out. But it could very well be that much. Absolutely.\nBut we're gonna find out.\nIn fact, I heard one of the other side, they were saying it's not 3 to 5. It's not 3 to 5. I said, \"Well, Mr. Trump is talking about registration, tell--\" He said, \"You know we don't wanna talk about registration.\" They don't wanna talk about registration.\nYou have people that are registered who are dead, who are illegals, who are in two states. You have people registered in two states. They're registered in a New York and a New Jersey. They vote twice. There are millions of votes, in my opinion. Now --\n-- investigation. David, David, David --\nOf course, and I want the voting process to be legitimate.\nSure. Sure. Sure.\nSure, done.\nNo, it hasn't. Take a look at the Pew reports.\nReally? Then why did he write the report?\nExcuse me, then why did he write the report?\nAccording to Pew report, then he's -- then he's groveling again. You know, I always talk about the reporters that grovel when they wanna write something that you wanna hear but not necessarily millions of people wanna hear or have to hear.\nWe're gonna launch an investigation to find out. And then the next time -- and I will say this, of those votes cast, none of 'em come to me. None of 'em come to me. They would all be for the other side. None of 'em come to me. But when you look at the people that are registered: dead, illegal and two states and some cases maybe three states -- we have a lot to look into.\nThere's nothing bigger. There's nothing bigger.\nLet me just tell you, you know what's important, millions of people agree with me when I say that if you would've looked on one of the other networks and all of the people that were calling in they're saying, \"We agree with Mr. Trump. We agree.\" They're very smart people.\nThe people that voted for me -- lots of people are saying they saw things happen. I heard stories also. But you're not talking about millions. But it's a small little segment. I will tell you, it's a good thing that we're doing because at the end we're gonna have an idea as to what's going on. Now, you're telling me Pew report has all of a sudden changed. But you have other reports and you have other statements. You take a look at the registrations, how many dead people are there? Take a look at the registrations as to the other things that I already presented.\nI didn't say there are millions. But I think there could very well be millions of people. That's right.\nDavid, and I also say this, if I was going for the popular vote I would've won easily. But I would've been in California and New York. I wouldn't have been in Maine. I wouldn't have been in Iowa. I wouldn't have been in Nebraska and all of those states that I had to win in order to win this. I would've been in New York, I would've been in California. I never even went there.\nThat's true.\nThat's true.\nYes, very much.\nNo, not at all.\nNot at all because many people feel the same way that I do. And --\nNo, not at all because they didn't come to me. Believe me. Those were Hillary votes. And if you look at it they all voted for Hillary. They all voted for Hillary. They didn't vote for me. I don't believe I got one. Okay, these are people that voted for Hillary Clinton. And if they didn't vote, it would've been different in the popular.\nNow, you have to understand I -- I focused on those four or five states that I had to win. Maybe she didn't. She should've gone to Michigan. She thought she had it in the bag. She should've gone to Wisconsin, she thought she had it because you're talking about 38 years of, you know, Democrat wins. But they didn't. I went to Michigan, I went to Wisconsin. I went to Pennsylvania all the time. I went to all of the states that are -- Florida and North Carolina. That's all I focused on.\nNo, no. We're looking at it for the next time. No, no, you have to understand, I had a tremendous victory, one of the great victories ever. In terms of counties I think the most ever or just about the most ever. When you look at a map it's all red. Red meaning us, Republicans.\nOne of the greatest victories ever. But, again, I ran for the electoral college. I didn't run for the popular vote. What I'm saying is if there are these problems that many people agree with me that there might be. Look, Barack Obama -- if you look back -- eight years ago when he first ran -- he was running for office in Chicago for we needed Chicago vote.\nAnd he was laughing at the system because he knew all of those votes were going to him. You look at Philadelphia, you look at what's going on in Philadelphia. But take a look at the tape of Barack Obama who wrote me, by the way, a very beautiful letter in the drawer of the desk. Very beautiful. And I appreciate it. But look at what he said, it's on tape. Look at what he said about voting in Chicago eight years ago. It's not changed. It hasn't changed, believe me. Chicago, look what's going on in Chicago. It's only gotten worse.\nBut he was smiling and laughing about the vote in Chicago. Now, once he became president he didn't do that. All of a sudden it became this is the foundation of our country. So, here's the point, you have a lot of stuff going on possibly. I say probably. But possibly. We're gonna get to the bottom of it.\nAnd then we're gonna make sure it doesn't happen again. If people are registered wrongly, if illegals are registered to vote, which they are, if dead people are registered to vote and voting, which they do. There are some. I don't know how many. We're gonna try finding that out and the other categories that we talk about, double states where they're -- registered in two states, we're gonna get to the bottom of it because we have to stop it. Because I agree, so important. But the other side is trying to downplay this. Now, I'll say this -- I think that if that didn't happen, first of all, would -- would be a great thing if it didn't happen. But I believe it did happen. And I believe a part of the vote would've been much different.\nWell, we're gonna find out.\nWe're gonna find out. And -- and, by the way, when I say you're gonna find out. You can never really find, you know, there are gonna be -- no matter what numbers we come up with there are gonna be lots of people that did things that we're not going to find out about. But we will find out because we need a better system where that can't happen.\nOK, so I'm glad you asked. So, I went to the CIA, my first step. I have great respect for the people in intelligence and CIA. I'm -- I don't have a lot of respect for, in particular one of the leaders. But that's okay. But I have a lot of respect for the people in the CIA.\nThat speech was a home run. That speech, if you look at Fox, OK, I'll mention you -- we see what Fox said. They said it was one of the great speeches. They showed the people applauding and screaming and -- and they were all CIA. There was -- somebody was asking Sean -- \"Well, were they Trump people that were put--\" we don't have Trump people. They were CIA people.\nThat location was given to me. Mike Pence went up before me, paid great homage to the wall. I then went up, paid great homage to the wall. I then spoke to the crowd. I got a standing ovation. In fact, they said it was the biggest standing ovation since Peyton Manning had won the Super Bowl and they said it was equal. I got a standing ovation. It lasted for a long period of time. What you do is take -- take out your tape -- you probably ran it live. I know when I do good speeches. I know when I do bad speeches. That speech was a total home run. They loved it. I could've --\nAbsolutely.\nPeople loved it. They loved it. They gave me a standing ovation for a long period of time. They never even sat down, most of them, during the speech. There was love in the room. You and other networks covered it very inaccurately. I hate to say this to you and you probably won't put it on but turn on Fox and see how it was covered. And see how people respond to that speech.\nThat speech was a good speech. And you and a couple of other networks tried to downplay that speech. And it was very, very unfortunate that you did. The people of the CIA loved the speech. If I was going to take a vote in that room, there were, like, 300, 350 people, over 1,000 wanted to be there but they couldn't. They were all CIA people. I would say I would've gotten 350 to nothing in that room. That's what the vote would've been. That speech was a big hit, a big success -- success. And then I came back and I watched you on television and a couple of others.\nAnd they tried to demean. Excuse me?\nNot you personally but your network -- and they tried to demean the speech. And I know when things are good or bad. A poll just came out on my inauguration speech which was extraordinary that people loved it. Loved and liked. And it was an extraordinary poll.\nNo, because you bring it up.\nWell, you just brought it up. I didn't bring it up. I didn't wanna -- talk about the inauguration speech. But I think I did a very good job and people really liked it. You saw the poll. Just came out this morning. You bring it up. I didn't bring it up.\nWell, you keep bringing it up. I had a massive amount of people here. They were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering -- from certain angles -- that were taken early and lots of other things. I'll show you a picture later if you'd like of a massive crowd.\nIn terms of a total audience including television and everything else that you have we had supposedly the biggest crowd in history. The audience watching the show. And I think you would even agree to that. They say I had the biggest crowd in the history of inaugural speeches. I'm honored by that. But I didn't bring it up. You just brought it up.\nPart of my whole victory was that the men and women of this country who have been forgotten will never be forgotten again. Part of that is when they try and demean me unfairly 'cause we had a massive crowd of people. We had a crowd -- I looked over that sea of people and I said to myself, \"Wow.\"\nAnd I've seen crowds before. Big, big crowds. That was some crowd. When I looked at the numbers that happened to come in from all of the various sources, we had the biggest audience in the history of inaugural speeches. I said the men and women that I was talking to who came out and voted will never be forgotten again. Therefore I won't allow you or other people like you to demean that crowd and to demean the people that came to Washington, D.C., from faraway places because they like me. But more importantly they like what I'm saying.\nNo, I think you're demeaning by talking the way you're talking. I think you're demeaning. And that's why I think a lot of people turned on you and turned on a lot of other people. And that's why you have a 17 percent approval rating, which is pretty bad.\nRight.\nIt's carnage. You know, in my speech I got tremendous -- from certain people the word carnage. It is carnage. It's horrible carnage. This is Afghanistan -- is not like what's happening in Chicago. People are being shot left and right. Thousands of people over a period -- over a short period of time.\nThis year, which has just started, is worse than last year, which was a catastrophe. They're not doing the job. Now if they want help, I would love to help them. I will send in what we have to send in. Maybe they're not gonna have to be so politically correct. Maybe they're being overly political correct. Maybe there's something going on. But you can't have those killings going on in Chicago. Chicago is like a war zone. Chicago is worse than some of the people that you report in some of the places that you report about every night --\n-- in the Middle East.\nI want them to fix the problem. You can't have thousands of people being shot in a city, in a country that I happen to be president of. Maybe it's okay if somebody else is president. I want them to fix the problem. They have a problem that's very easily fixable.\nThey're gonna have to get tougher and stronger and smarter. But they gotta fix the problem. I don't want to have thousands of people shot in a city where essentially I'm the president. I love Chicago. I know Chicago. And Chicago is a great city, can be a great city.\nIt can't be a great city. Excuse me. It can't be a great city if people are shot walking down the street for a loaf of bread. Can't be a great city.\nWell, so far they have been unable. It's been going on for years. And I wasn't president. So, look, when President Obama was there two weeks ago making a speech, very nice speech. Two people were shot and killed during his speech. You can't have that.\nThey weren't shot at the speech. But they were shot in the city of Chicago during his speech. What -- what's going on? So, all I'm saying is to the mayor who came up to my office recently -- I say, \"You have to smarten up and you have to toughen up because you can't let that happen. That's a war zone.\"\nI want them to straighten out the problem. It's a big problem.\nWell, I'll be talking about that in about two hours. So, you'll be there and you'll be able to see it for yourself.\nYou're gonna see in about two hours.\nWell, I have a general who I have great respect for, General Mattis, who said -- I was a little surprised -- who said he's not a believer in torture. As you know, Mr. Pompeo was just approved, affirmed by the Senate. He's a fantastic guy, he's gonna be the head of the CIA.\nAnd you have somebody fabulous as opposed to the character that just got out who didn't -- was not fabulous at all. And he will I think do a great job. And he is -- you know, I haven't gone into great detail. But I will tell you I have spoken to others in intelligence. And they are big believers in, as an example, waterboarding.\nBecause they say it does work. It does work.\nI would do -- I wanna keep our country safe. I wanna keep our country safe.\nWhen they're shooting -- when they're chopping off the heads of our people and other people, when they're chopping off the heads of people because they happen to be a Christian in the Middle East, when ISIS is doing things that nobody has ever heard of since Medieval times, would I feel strongly about waterboarding?\nAs far as I'm concerned we have to fight fire with fire. Now, with that being said I'm going with General Mattis. I'm going with my secretary because I think Pompeo's gonna be phenomenal. I'm gonna go with what they say. But I have spoken as recently as 24 hours ago with people at the highest level of intelligence. And I asked them the question, \"Does it work? Does torture work?\" And the answer was, \"Yes, absolutely.\"\nI don't want people to chop off the citizens or anybody's heads in the Middle East. Okay? Because they're Christian or Muslim or anything else. I don't want -- look, you are old enough to have seen a time that was much different. You never saw heads chopped off until a few years ago.\nNow they chop 'em off and they put 'em on camera and they send 'em all over the world. So we have that and we're not allowed to do anything. We're not playing on an even field. I will say this, I will rely on Pompeo and Mattis and my group. And if they don't wanna do, that's fine. If they do wanna do, then I will work for that end.\nI wanna do everything within the bounds of what you're allowed to do legally. But do I feel it works? Absolutely I feel it works. Have I spoken to people at the top levels and people that have seen it work? I haven't seen it work. But I think it works. Have I spoken to people that feel strongly about it? Absolutely.\n-- no, I wanna -- I will rely on General Mattis. And I'm gonna rely on those two people and others. And if they don't wanna do it, it's 100 percent okay with me. Do I think it works? Absolutely.\nRight.\nWe're talking about -- no it's not the Muslim ban. But it's countries that have tremendous terror. It's countries that we're going to be spelling out in a little while in the same speech. And it's countries that people are going to come in and cause us tremendous problems. Our country has enough problems without allowing people to come in who, in many cases or in some cases, are looking to do tremendous destruction.\n-- you'll be hearing about it in two hours because I have a whole list. You'll be very thrilled. You're looking at people that come in, in many cases, in some cases with evil intentions. I don't want that. They're ISIS. They're coming under false pretense. I don't want that.\nI'm gonna be the president of a safe country. We have enough problems. Now I'll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people. I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries. And all you have to do is take a look. It's -- it's a disaster what's happening over there.\nI don't want that to happen here. Now with that being said, President Obama and Hillary Clinton have, and Kerry have allowed tens of thousands of people into our country. The FBI is now investigating more people than ever before having to do with terror. They -- and it's from the group of people that came in. So look, look, our country has a lot of problems. Believe me. I know what the problems are even better than you do. They're deep problems, they're serious problems. We don't need more.\nYou're going to see -- you're going to see. We're going to have extreme vetting in all cases. And I mean extreme. And we're not letting people in if we think there's even a little chance of some problem.\nWe are excluding certain countries. But for other countries we're gonna have extreme vetting. It's going to be very hard to come in. Right now it's very easy to come in. It's gonna be very, very hard. I don't want terror in this country. You look at what happened in San Bernardino. You look at what happened all over. You look at what happened in the World Trade Center. Okay, I mean, take that as an example.\nAnger?\nThere's plenty of anger right now. How can you have more?\n-- David, I mean, I know you're a sophisticated guy. The world is a mess. The world is as angry as it gets. What? You think this is gonna cause a little more anger? The world is an angry place. All of this has happened. We went into Iraq. We shouldn't have gone into Iraq. We shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out.\nThe world is a total mess. Take a look at what's happening with Aleppo. Take a look what's happening in Mosul. Take a look what's going on in the Middle East. And people are fleeing and they're going into Europe and all over the place. The world is a mess, David.\nWell, we should've kept the oil when we got out. And, you know, it's very interesting, had we taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS because they fuel themselves with the oil. That's where they got the money. They got the money from leaving -- when we left, we left Iraq, which wasn't a government. It's not a government now.\nAnd by the way, and I said something else, if we go in and do this. You have two nations, Iraq and Iran. And they were essentially the same military strength. And they'd fight for decades and decades. They'd fight forever. And they'd keep fighting and it would go -- it was just a way of life. We got in, we decapitated one of those nations, Iraq. I said, \"Iran is taking over Iraq.\" That's essentially what happened.\nWe should have taken the oil. You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil. Now I wasn't talking about it from the standpoint of ISIS because the way we got out was horrible. We created a vacuum and ISIS formed. But had we taken the oil something else would've very good happened. They would not have been able to fuel their rather unbelievable drive to destroy large portions of the world.\nWait, wait, can you believe that? Who are the critics who say that? Fools.\nI don't call them critics. I call them fools.\nWe should've kept -- excuse me. We should've taken the oil. And if we took the oil you wouldn't have ISIS. And we would have had wealth. We have spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East. And our country is falling apart.\nOur roads -- excuse me. Our roads, our bridges, our schools, it's falling apart. We have spent as of one month ago $6 trillion in the Middle East. And in our country we can't afford to build a school in Brooklyn or we can't afford to build a school in Los Angeles. And we can't afford to fix up our inner cities. We can't afford to do anything. Look, it's time. It's been our longest war. We've been in there for 15, 16 years. Nobody even knows what the date is because they don't really know when did we start. But it's time. It's time.\nWell, don't let it get your attention too much because we'll see what happens. I mean, we're gonna see what happens. You know, I told you and I told everybody else that wants to talk when it comes to the military I don't wanna discuss things.\nI wanna let -- I wanna let the action take place before the talk takes place. I watched in Mosul when a number of months ago generals and politicians would get up and say, \"We're going into Mosul in four months.\" Then they'd say, \"We're going in in three months, two months, one month. We're going in next week.\"\nOkay, and I kept saying to myself, \"Gee, why do they have to keep talking about going in?\" All right, so now they go in and it is tough because they're giving the enemy all this time to prepare. I don't wanna do a lot of talking on the military. I wanna talk after it's finished, not before it starts.\nIt's going to be -- what my plan is is that I wanna take care of everybody. I'm not gonna leave the lower 20 percent that can't afford insurance. Just so you understand people talk about Obamacare. And I told the Republicans this, the best thing we could do is nothing for two years, let it explode. And then we'll go in and we'll do a new plan and -- and the Democrats will vote for it. Believe me.\nBecause this year you'll have 150 percent increases. Last year in Arizona 116 perecent increase, Minnesota 60 some-odd percent increase. And I told them, except for one problem, I wanna get it fixed. The best thing I could do as the leader of this country-- but as wanting to get something approved with support of the Democrats, if I didn't do anything for two years they'd be begging me to do something. But I don't wanna do that. So just so you unders-- Obamacare is a disaster.\nIt's too expensive. It's horrible health care. It doesn't cover what you have to cover. It's a disaster. You know it and I know it. And I said to the Republican folks-- and they're terrific folks, Mitch and Paul Ryan, I said, \"Look, if you go fast -- and I'm okay in doing it because it's the right thing to do. We wanna get good coverage at much less cost.\" I said, \"If you go fast we then own Obamacare. They're gonna put it on us. And Obamacare is a disaster waiting to explode. If you sit back and let it explode it's gonna be much easier.\" That's the thing to do. But the right thing to do is to get something done now.\nSo I wanna make sure that nobody's dying on the streets when I'm president. Nobody's gonna be dying on the streets. We will unleash something that's gonna be terrific. And remember this, before Obamacare you had a lot of people that were very, very happy with their health care.\nAnd now those people in many cases don't even have health care. They don't even have anything that's acceptable to them. Remember this, keep your doctor, keep your plan, 100 percent. Remember the $5 billion website? Remember the website fiasco. I mean, you do admit that I think, right? The website fiasco.\nObamacare is a disaster. We are going to come up with a new plan ideally not an amended plan because right now if you look at the pages they're this high. We're gonna come up with a new plan that's going to be better health care for more people at a lesser cost.\nSo nobody ever deducts all the people that have already lost their health insurance that liked it. You had millions of people that liked their health insurance and their health care and their doctor and where they went. You had millions of people that now aren't insured anymore.\nNo, no.\n-- here's what I can assure you, we are going to have a better plan, much better health care, much better service treatment, a plan where you can have access to the doctor that you want and the plan that you want. We're gonna have a much better health care plan at much less money.\nAnd remember Obamacare is ready to explode. And you interviewed me a couple of years ago. I said '17 -- right now, this year, \"'17 is going to be a disaster.\" I'm very good at this stuff. \"'17 is going to be a disaster cost-wise for Obamacare. It's going to explode in '17.\"\nAnd why not? Obama's a smart guy. So let it all come do because that's what's happening. It's all coming do in '17. We're gonna have an explosion. And to do it right, sit back, let it explode and let the Democrats come begging us to help them because it's on them. But I don't wanna do that. I wanna give great health care at a much lower cost.\n-- say no one I think no one. Ideally, in the real world, you're talking about millions of people. Will no one. And then, you know, knowing ABC, you'll have this one person on television saying how they were hurt. Okay. We want no one. We want the answer to be no one.\nBut I will say millions of people will be happy. Right now you have millions and millions and millions of people that are unhappy. It's too expensive and it's no good. And the governor of Minnesota who unfortunately had a very, very sad incident yesterday 'cause he's a very nice guy but -- a couple of months ago he said that the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable.\nHe's a staunch Democrat. Very strong Democrat. He said it's no longer affordable. He made that statement. And Bill Clinton on the campaign trail -- and he probably had a bad night that night when he went home -- but he said, \"Obamacare is crazy. It's crazy.\" And you know what, they were both right.\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-david-muir-abc-news-world-news-tonight-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom", "Date": "2017-01-27", "Text": "Thank you very much. I am honored to have Prime Minister Theresa May here for our first official visit from a foreign leader. This is our first visit, so—great honor.\nThe special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace. And by the way, my mother was born in Scotland—Stornoway—which is serious Scotland. [Laughter]\nToday the United States renews our deep bond with Britain: military, financial, cultural, and political. We have one of the great bonds. We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship. Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law. That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination. A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.\nBoth America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.\nMadam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business, and foreign affairs. Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.\nOn behalf of our Nation, I thank you for joining us here today. It's a really great honor. Thank you very much.\nThank you.\nThank you very much. That's very nicely stated. Steve Holland [Reuters]. Where's Steve? Steve—yes.\nRussia-U.S. Relations\nWell, I hear a call was set up, Steve, and we'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. That won't necessarily happen, unfortunately, it probably won't happen with many countries, but if we can have, as we do with Prime Minister May and the relationship that we've all developed, and even in the short relationship that we've just developed just by being with each other—we're going to have lunch, and we've really had some very interesting talks and very productive talks—but if we can have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I'm all for that. That would be a tremendous asset. No guarantees, but if we can, that would be a positive, not a negative. Okay?\nAbsolutely. [Laughter]\nThis was your choice of a question? [Laughter]\nThere goes that relationship. [Laughter]\nVery good. We have a great general who has just been appointed Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, and he has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. Enhanced interrogation, I guess, would be a word that a lot of—words that a lot of people would like to use. I don't necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override, because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert. He's highly respected. He's the general's general—got through the Senate very, very quickly, which in this country is not easy, I will tell you. [Laughter] And so I'm going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. I've been open about that for a long period of time, but I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win with or without, but I do disagree.\nAs far as, again, Putin and Russia, I don't say good, bad, or indifferent. I don't know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully. And if we have a great relationship with Russia and other countries, and if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped—that's an evil that has to be stopped—I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.\nHow the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people, and I don't like them at all. [Laughter] And I've had some where I didn't think I was going to have much of a relationship, and it turned out to be a great relationship. So, Theresa, we never know about those things, do we? [Laughter] But I will tell you one thing, I'll be representing the American people very strongly. Thank you.\nHow about John Roberts, Fox.\nThe President's Phone Conversation With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico/Mexico-U.S. Relations\nThank you.\nWell, I think the Prime Minister, first of all, has other things that she's much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship. But I will say that we had a very good call. I have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I work with the Mexican people all the time, great relationships. But as you know, Mexico—with the United States—has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I'm not going to let that happen. And General Kelly is going to do a fantastic job at Homeland Security. As you know, we swore him in yesterday.\nWe have a really, I think, a very good relationship, the President and I, and we had a talk that lasted for about an hour this morning. And we are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship. But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies, and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won't happen with me. We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing. And so we are going to renegotiate our trade deals, and we are going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico. And in the end, I think it will be good for both countries.\nBut it was a very, very friendly call. I think you'll hear that from the President, and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico that really represent him and represent him very well. And I look forward to—over the coming months we'll be negotiating, and we'll see what happens. But I'm representing the people of the United States, and I'm going to represent them as somebody should represent them, not how they've been represented in the past, where we lose to every single country.\nActually, I'm not as brash as you might think. [Laughter] And I can tell you that I think we're going to get along very well. You know, I've—interesting because I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa. And I can often tell how I get along with somebody very early, and I believe we're going to have a fantastic relationship.\nBrexit—and I really don't change my position very much. If you go back and you look, my position on trade has been solid for many, many years, since I was a very young person talking about how we were getting ripped off by the rest of the world. Now, I never knew I'd be in this position where we can actually do something about it. But we will be talking to your folks about Brexit. Brexit was an example of what was to come, and I happened to be in Scotland at Turnberry cutting a ribbon when Brexit happened. And we had a vast amount of press there. And I said Brexit—this was the day before, you probably remember—I said Brexit is going to happen. And I was scorned in the press for making that prediction. I was scorned. And I said I believe it's going to happen, because people want to know who's coming into their country, and they want to control their own trade and various other things. And lo and behold, the following day, it happened. And the odds weren't looking good for me when I made that statement, because as you know, everybody thought it was not going to happen.\nI think Brexit's going to be a wonderful thing for your country. I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you're going to have the people that you want in your country, and you're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you're doing. And I had a very bad experience. I have—I had something when I was in my other world. I have something in another country, and getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. Getting the approvals from the country was fast, easy, and efficient. Getting the approvals from the group—I call them the consortium—was very, very tough. But I thought Brexit—I think and I think it'll go down that it will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom. I think in the end it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability. Okay.Prime Minister.And just on the question you asked me, Tom. I mean, I think as the President himself has said, I think we have already struck up a good relationship. But you asked what we had in common. I think if you look at the approach that we're both taking, I think one of the things that we have in common is that we want to put the interests of ordinary working people right up there, center stage. Those people who, you know, they're working all the hours, they're doing their best for their families, and sometimes, they just feel the odds are stacked against them. And it's that interest in ensuring that what we do, that the economies—our economies and our governments actually work for ordinary working people—work for everyone in our countries. I think we both share that.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-theresa-may-the-united-kingdom"}
{"Title": "Interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News", "Date": "2017-02-03", "Text": "Yes it did, yes it did.\nO'Reilly:But the refugee deal, not so much.\nI think it was very smooth. We had 109 people out of hundreds of thousands of travelers and all we did was vet those people very, very carefully.\nO'Reilly:You wouldn't do anything differently if you had to do it over again? Some of your people didn't really know what the order was.\nWell, that's not what General Kelly said. General Kelly — who's now Secretary Kelly — he said he totally knew, he was aware of it, and it was very smooth. It was 109 people.\nO'Reilly:Let's talk about Iran, your assessment. Do you think we're on a collision course — we being the United States — with that country?\nI think it was the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated. I think it was a deal that never should have been negotiated —\nO'Reilly:The nuclear deal?\nAbsolutely. The deal that was made by the Obama administration. I think it's a shame that we've had a deal like that and that we had to sign a deal like that and there was no reason to do it and if you're going to do it, have a good deal.\nWe gave them $1.7 billion in cash, which is unheard of, and we put the money up and we have really nothing to show for it.\nO'Reilly:Possible you'll tear it up?\nWe'll see what happens. We're going to see what happens I can say this: They have total disregard for our country. They are the number one terrorist state, they are sending money all over the place, and weapons, and you can't do that.\nO'Reilly:Sanctions, that's how you're gonna start with them. But you're moving a carrier right?\nI never talk about military moves. I always criticized President Obama with having an announcement that they're going into Mosul. They give the name, the date the time. I don't believe in that.\nO'Reilly:So you're not real bullish on Iran at this point.\nI'm not bullish. I think they have total disrespect for our country and I understand that deal. I would have lived with it if they said \"OK, were all together now,\" but it's just the opposite. It's like they're emboldened. They follow our planes, they circle our ships with their little boats and they lost respect because they can't believe anybody could be so stupid as to make a deal like that.\nO'Reilly:You talked to Putin last week. You had a busy week last week.\nBusy week and a half.\nO'Reilly:Do you respect Putin?\nO'Reilly:Do you? Why?\nWell, I respect a lot of people but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with him. He's a leader of his country. I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world — that's a good thing. Will I get along with him? I have no idea.\nO'Reilly:But he's a killer though. Putin's a killer.\nThere are a lot of killers. We've got a lot of killers. What do you think — our country's so innocent. You think our country's so innocent?\nO'Reilly:I don't know of any government leaders that are killers.\nWell — take a look at what we've done too. We made a lot of mistakes. I've been against the war in Iraq from the beginning.\nA lot of mistakes, but a lot of people were killed. A lot of killers around, believe me.\nO'Reilly:Let's talk about Mexico. There's a report that you talked to President Nieto and you told him — this was the report, I want to know if it's true or not — that if his army couldn't handle the drug cartels, that U.S. army soldiers would. Did you say that?\nWe have to do something about the cartels. I did talk to him about it. I want to help him with it. I think he's a very good man. We have a very good relationship, as you probably know. He seemed very willing to get help from us because he has got a problem, and it's a real problem for us. Don't forget those cartels are operating in our country. And they're poisoning the youth of our country.\nO'Reilly:At this point, do you consider Mexico a corrupt country? Because this stuff has been going on for decades.\nI love the people. I really like this administration. I think he's a good man. We get along very well. But they have problems controlling aspects of their country. There's no question about it, and I would say the drugs and the drug cartels, No. 1.\nO'Reilly:Have you figured out what kind of a tariff you're gonna levy on Mexico to pay for the wall?\nWell, right now it's very unfavorable. Right now, we're losing our jobs to Mexico. You look at the plants, these massive plants. Now I have to tell you, I've turned it around already, I've turned it around. You see that. Ford has been phenomenal. They cancelled a plant. They're building tremendous ...\nO'Reilly:Yeah, you intimidated them. They're afraid of you.\nI don't know if they're afraid of me. They wanna do what's right.\nO'Reilly:They wanna do what's right? Why didn't they do what was right in the past? They're afraid of you.\nBecause the wrong people spoke to them. But they're gonna do what's right, and they're bringing jobs back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and all the places that have lost their jobs. That's already happening. I think you're gonna see tremendous job growth in this country.\nO'Reilly:Let's turn to domestic policy. I just spent the week in California. As you know, they are now voting on whether they should become a sanctuary state. So California, and the USA, are on a collision course. How do you see it?\nWell, I think it's ridiculous. Sanctuary cities, as you know, I'm very much opposed to sanctuary cities. They breed crime, there's a lot of problems. If we have to, we'll defund. We give tremendous amounts of money to California — California in many ways is out of control, as you know. Obviously the voters agree, otherwise they wouldn't have voted for me.\nO'Reilly:So defunding is your weapon of choice?\nWell it's a weapon. I don't want to defund a state, a city.\nO'Reilly:But you're willing to do it?\nI don't want to defund anyone. I want to give them the money they need to properly operate as a city or state. If they're going to have sanctuary cities, we may have to do that. Certainly that would be a weapon.\nO'Reilly:Is there any validity to the criticism of you that you say things you can't back up factually, and as the president, if you say, for example, that there are 3 million illegal aliens who voted and then you don't have the data to back it up, some people are gonna say that it's irresponsible for a president to say that. Is there any validity to that?\nMany people have come out and said I'm right. You know that.\nO'Reilly:I know, but you've gotta have data to back that up.\nLet me just tell you. And it doesn't have to do with the vote, although that's the end result. It has to do with the registration. And when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted, when you see people that are registered in two states that voted in two states, when you see other things, when you see illegals, people that are not citizens, and they're on the registration rolls. Look, Bill, we can be babies, but you take a look at the registration, you have illegals, you have dead people, you have this. It's really a bad situation. It's really bad.\nO'Reilly:So you think you're gonna be proven correct in that statement?\nWell, I think I already have. A lot of people have come out and said that I am correct.\nO'Reilly:But the data has to show that 3 million illegals voted.\nForget that. Forget all of that. Just take a look at the registration, and we're gonna do it, and I'm gonna set up a commission, to be headed by Vice President Mike Pence, and we're gonna look at it very, very carefully.\nO'Reilly:Well, that's good. Let's get to the bottom of this. 2017, can Americans expect a tax cut?\nI think so, yes, and I think before the end of the year. I would like to say yes.\nO'Reilly:Can Americans in 2017 expect a new healthcare plan rolled out by the Trump administration, this year?\nIn the process, and maybe it'll take until sometime into next year, but we are certainly gonna be in the process. Very complicated. Obamacare is a disaster. You have to remember, Obamacare doesn't work. So we are putting in a wonderful plan. It statutorily takes a while to get. We're gonna be putting it in fairly soon. I think that, yes, I would like to say, by the end of the year, at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year.\nO'Reilly. Last question. You get four hours of sleep or some crazy thing like that. When your head hits the pillow, do you ever say to yourself, \"I can't believe I'm here. I cannot believe that I'm the president of the United States when I wasn't a politician, I didn't start out this way, that wasn't my life goal?\" Does that ever come into your mind?\nWell, I must tell you, the other day, I walked into the main entrance of the White House, and I said to myself, \"This is sort of amazing.\" Or you walk into Air Force One. It's like a surreal experience, in a certain way, but you have to get over it, because there's so much work to be done, whether it's jobs or other nations that truly hate us. You have to get over it.\nO'Reilly:Football. How do you see this game?\nWell, I like Bob Kraft. I like Coach Belichick, and Tom Brady is my friend.\nO'Reilly:They're all taking gas because of that, you know.\nI know, they're talking a lot of heat. But you know what? They're also getting a lot of popularity out of it. I think they're gonna do very well. Tom's a winner.\nO'Reilly:So you're rooting for the Patriots?\nI think the other team is fantastic, though. No, I think it's a fantastic team. Turned out to be a good quarterback. But you know, there's less pressure on the Patriots, because they've been there. Once you've won, once you've done it, and they've done it, once you've done it, there's a lot less pressure. So we'll see what happens. But you know, you have to stick up for your friends, right?\nO'Reilly:Sure. Now, Fox Sports is demanding I ask you to make a prediction.\nI hate to make predictions.\nO'Reilly:But you have to.\nI hate to do it. I don't even know what are the odds. I guess it's pretty even, two great teams, pretty even, so I'll say the Patriots will win.\nO'Reilly:By how many points?\nBy eight points.\nO'Reilly:All right. That's a good presidential prediction, and we'll see.\nShouldn't be doing those things, but that's OK.\nO'Reilly:You don't need data on that.\nI need no data on that.\nO'Reilly:Mr. President, thanks very much for taking the time.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-bill-oreilly-fox-news-0"}
{"Title": "Interview With Jim Gray of Westwood One Sports Radio Network", "Date": "2017-02-05", "Text": "I'm very good, thank you, Jim.\nWell, I guess you have to say that. They've been great friends of mine for a long period of time, and they're terrific people. And I have to tell you, the Falcons have terrific people also. But I've known them a long time, so I guess we're allowed to do that every once in a while. They are really wonderful. I think it's going to be a wonderful game, actually.\nWell, I don't have to give them advice. These are champions. These are winners; they know how to win. And I speak to them on occasion, but I don't have to really speak very much about winning. They know how to do it. And it's a lot of pressure on them, but probably less so because they've been there and they've done it before. So more pressure always on the ones that haven't done it.\nWell, I haven't seen it. I mean, honestly, I've been so busy doing other things I haven't seen that. I haven't noticed it. But I can tell you that, generally speaking, that's a two-way street. There may be some people that aren't liking the fact that he may feel good about me, but there are a lot of other people that like him a lot better because of it.\nSo that really has proven to be a two-way street. There have been many instances of that, where people have sort of said—a little bit negative about whatever it may be, even a store or a chain, and the chain's business goes through the roof. I mean, we've had cases like that too. So it really is a two-way street, Jim.\nWell, I think Tom Brady is a great guy. And it's over with, and we don't have to discuss it, but it was a rough period of time, and it was very sad. I thought it was very sad. And look at the season he's had—missing four games, and look at the great season he's had. So I just think it was an unfortunate experience, and I think it was bad for probably everybody involved. And that's all behind us, so that's a good thing.\nWell, I'd just say good luck, just do a good job with the NFL. I mean, he handled the various situations—this was prior to me running for office—and he handled the various situations in his way, and I hope he's happy with it. I think it's good if he is. But people can disagree on everything. I may not have disagreed—I may really have looked upon the way he handled it a little bit differently than others, but you know what, it's the NFL. It's going to do well. The game is going to be very interesting. We'll see what happens.\nWell, Tom is always pardoned, you know that. Tom doesn't need a pardon. Tom—his game pardons him, and his talent. He's a great champion. So I think his game really pardons him. And frankly, I don't think he's somebody that has to be pardoned.\nIf they wanted, I would allow them to play, but I will say that they have to be very careful, because that would be the big risk to the NFL if it gets to a point where people are afraid to let their children play. That would not be a good thing for the NFL, certainly. But it depends on the level. I mean, I know—I played football at a certain level, and I will tell you, it's a rough game, it's a tough game. And there's something really good about that in terms of competition and learning how to compete and win. But it's a rough game, and a lot of people are deciding the other way.\nBut regardless, I would also leave it up to the young person in the family. I think I would have to do that.\nWell, I have no opinion on it. They're going to have to take a look at that. They're going to talk with the league; they're going to be talking to, obviously, government officials wherever it may be. And when it comes up to the level of the Presidency, I'll have an opinion.\nWell, what I'd do is I'd sit down with the commissioners. I would be talking to them, and we'll see how they feel about it. Some would not want it, and probably others—and I've read where others maybe do. But I would certainly want to get their input and get the input from the various leagues, and we'll see how they feel about it. I'd also get the input from lots of law enforcement officials, because obviously, that's a big step. So we wouldn't do it lightly, I can tell you. It will be studied very carefully. But I would want to have a lot of input from a lot of different people.\nWell, I've been asked to support it, and I've actually spoken to the Olympic Committee in Europe. And they are—I think, were very happy when they spoke to me. They wanted to have an endorsement from me, and I gave it to them very loud and clear. I would love to see the Olympics go to Los Angeles. I think that it will be terrific. The United States Committee's members have asked me to speak up about it, and I have. And I think I've helped them. And let's see what happens.\nBut I'd be very happy and honored if they would choose Los Angeles, and we'd stand behind it.\nWell, I don't know, but we have to have—regardless, we have to have security in our country. We have to know who's coming into our country. We have to have people that are coming in with good intentions, Jim. If people are coming in with bad intentions, I want to be able to find out before they get here.\nYou see what's happened in other countries, you see what's happened in our country. Take a look at so many different events, including the World Trade Center. So if people want to come into our country, they have to come in with good intentions. And we want to have strong borders. And we want to have extreme vetting, and we want to know what we're doing, frankly. And right now it's tied up in the courts. And I think it's a bad situation for the country. I think it's very, very bad. We have to know exactly who's coming into our country. And I think most people agree with me on that. And they may not express it, but you're seeing it more and more, people are agreeing with me. I want security for the United States.\nWell, I think that's going to be really up to the various Olympic committees. They've taken a very strong stand, and that's going to be up to them, much more so than me. So we'll see what they have to say, Jim.\nI don't know. I think—I know he loves the game, and we're going to have a lot of fun. It won't matter. I'll just make sure he's my partner. [Laughter]\nWell, I think it's great that they come together. But I will say, we were a very divided country before I came along. And one of the reasons I won the election is because of the fact that we were such a divided country. And we had a tremendous group of people that—you look at issues and you look at what's going on, and there was such division in our country. And I think a lot of people think that I'm going to be able to bring it together, and I think I will be able to do that.\nBut we have been a very, very divided country for a very long period of time. And you know, I guess they consider me to be very much of an outsider, but it's an outsider that can bring us together. And I think I'll be able to do that.\nWell, boxing is an interesting—I've had many, many fights, as you know. I've been involved with just about everybody in that business, and I really enjoy the boxing, and I enjoy what they've done with the UFC, Dana White and all of the folks, the families that have done such a great job with that. And I enjoy sports at any kind. I enjoy virtually every sport. And sports—nothing is easy. Sports isn't easy. And—but I have great respect for what they're doing and what they're doing with the—I think today's game is terrific, and I think it's going to be terrific.\nWell, I think I've done well. I think polls are showing that I've done well. It's been tough on a lot of people because we're breaking the glass a little bit. We're doing what has to be done. We're being strong on vetting; we're being strong on coming into the country. It's very easy if you just let it be the way it was, but the FBI has over a thousand investigations going on right now on terror and terrorism. They've never had anything like that before. And that's been reported all over the place.\nAnd frankly, we have to have a safe country. But I think I've done very well. We have plants coming back and going into Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio; and the car companies are pouring back into our country. I've saved hundreds of millions of dollars in negotiation on the F-35 fighter jet and various military elements that I've gotten involved in the negotiation. I've saved hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. That will end up being many, many billions of dollars.\nI think I'm getting very high marks by a lot of people.\nThank you very much, Jim. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jim-gray-westwood-one-sports-radio-network"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan", "Date": "2017-02-10", "Text": "Thank you very much. Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the American people, I welcome you to the very famous White House. You honor us with your presence. This is one of our earliest visits from a foreign leader, and I am truly glad that it could be from such an important and steadfast ally.\nThe bond between our two nations—and the friendship between our two peoples—runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer. We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance.\nThank you very much. We'll take a few questions, unless you don't want to ask any questions, if that's possible. [Laughter] Maybe we'll start—where is Daniel Halper, New York Post? Daniel.\nWell, your question was unrelated to what we're here for today, but I'll answer it. We are going to keep our country safe; we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we'll be very successful with. It shouldn't have taken this much time, because safety is a primary reason. One of the reasons I'm standing here today is the security of our country. The voters felt that I would give it the best security. So we'll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country. You'll be seeing that sometime next week.\nIn addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately, I have no doubt that we'll win that particular case.\nOkay. Blake Berman, Fox. Blake Berman.\nI feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States. We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign because I saw what was happening. And while I've been President, which is just for a very short period of time, I've learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely, President. And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen.\nSo we'll be going forward. We'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe. It will happen rapidly. And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people. We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country. It's always going to be that way, at least during my administration, I can tell you that.\nThank you. I will say that—and you've seen it—ever since I won the election and became President-elect, I've been telling companies—car companies and other companies—many companies: Come back into the United States. And they've been coming back in. And big announcements are going to be made over the next short period of time. Some of you already know what those announcements are.\nWe've lost a lot of our factories, a lot of our plants. And those factories and those plants will be coming back. And jobs will be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and so many other places where we've lost so many jobs. And those are the people that were so good to me, and now I'm being good to them.\nAnd so we've had a tremendous number of announcements. We've had Ford and General Motors and many, many others—Intel yesterday made a major announcement. And they did that because of what is happening with our tax structure, which is going along very well. And we'll be having some very big news over the next short period of time.\nBut we are a nation of tremendous potential. And the expression \"Make America Great Again,\" I will tell you—and I will add very strongly and with great assurety—it will be greater than ever before.\nAnd I just want to thank the Prime Minister for a friendship. We developed a great friendship when we met in New York City at Trump Tower. We spoke for a long, long period of time. And when I greeted him today at the car, I was saying—I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond, very, very good chemistry. I'll let you know if it changes, but I don't think it will. [Laughter]\nSo I just want to thank the Prime Minister for being here. We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time, and I look very much forward to that.\nAnd I want to thank everybody in the room. We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.\nYes, certainly. Okay, go ahead.China-U.S. Relations/Trade/Health Care Reform\nI had a very, very good conversation, as most of you know, yesterday with the President of China. It was a very, very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan. So we had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk. And we are working on that as we speak. We have conversations with various representatives of China. I believe that that will all work out very well for everybody: China, Japan, the United States, and everybody in the region.\nAs far as the currency devaluations, I've been complaining about that for a long time. And I believe that we will all eventually—and probably, very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think—we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way it's fair. That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things. And we will be on that field, and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country. But it has to be fair. And we will make it fair.\nI think the United States is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now, by a lot, when it comes to trade. A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which you'll be seeing in the not-too-distant future. We'll have an incentive based policy much more so than we have right now. Right now we don't even know—nobody knows what policy we have. But we're going to have a very much incentive-based policy. We're working with Congress, working with Paul Ryan, working with Mitch McConnell. And I think people are going to be very, very impressed.\nWe're also working very much—and this has a lot to do with business—on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much-reduced price, both to the people receiving the health care and to our country. Because our country is paying so much, and Obamacare, as you know, is a total and complete disaster. So we're going to end up with tremendous health care at a lower price. And I think people are going to be extremely happy. Difficult process, but once we get going—and as you know, Tom Price was just approved a few hours ago. So we finally have our Secretary, and now we get down to the final strokes.\nAgain, I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank Mr. Prime Minister. What an honor, what a great honor it is. And let's go to Florida.

{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada", "Date": "2017-02-13", "Text": "Prime Minister Trudeau, on behalf of all Americans, I thank you for being with us today. It is my honor to host such a great friend, neighbor, and ally at the White House, a very special place. This year, Canada celebrates the 150th year of Confederation. For Americans, this is one of the many milestones in our friendship, and we look forward—very much forward, I must say—to many more to come.\nOur two nations share much more than a border. We share the same values. We share the love—and a truly great love—of freedom. And we share a collective defense. American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together, which we have.\nIn these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance. The United States is deeply grateful for Canada's contribution to the counter-ISIS effort. Thank you. And we continue to work in common—and in common cause—against terrorism and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth.\nWe understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce. Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada. We should coordinate closely—and we will coordinate closely—to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe.\nPrime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.\nAmerica is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada. We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce. Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people.\nWe just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else. We know that. I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused—and you're focused—on the important role women play in our economies. We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and very importantly, access to networks.\nIn our discussion today, we will focus on improving the ways our Government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world.\nOkay, we'll take a couple of questions. Scott Thuman [WJLA, Sinclair Broadcasting Group]. Scott.\nCanada-U.S. Relations\nThank you.\nWell, we just began discussions. We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before. We have some wonderful ideas on immigration. We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism. And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly—we have a group of very talented people—we will see some very, very obvious results. We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade.\nWe have—through technology, we have some really great ideas, and they'll be implemented fairly quickly.\nKaitlan Collins [Daily Caller], please.\nOkay. Thank you. Many, many problems. When I was campaigning, I said it's not a good situation. Now that I see it—including with our intelligence briefings—we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here. Well, I mean, obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly. We have problems all over the Middle East. We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look. I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well—extended weekend, really. We were with each other for long periods of time and our staffs and representatives.\nBut on the home front, we have to create borders. We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that. We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country. But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration. And people—citizens of our country—want that, and that's their attitude too, I will tell you.\nWe are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense—maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense—and we are going to pursue it vigorously. And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here, but all over the world. We won't stand for it. We won't put up for—with it. We're just not going to let it happen. We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States. And they will go well. Thank you.\nOkay.\nI agree with that a hundred percent. We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We'll be tweaking it. We'll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries. It's a much less severe situation than what's taken place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States. It was an extremely unfair transaction. We're going to work with Mexico; we're going to make it a fair deal for both parties. I think that we're going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand, and we understand.\nYou probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation—lowering taxes, et cetera—they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands of thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same. Jack Ma—we have so many people that want to come into the United States. It's actually very exciting.\nI think it's going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women. It's not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me.\nSo our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we're going to work together to make it even better. And as far as the southern border is concerned, we're going to get that worked\nout. We're going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy. It's very important to me.\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-justin-pj-trudeau-canada"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel", "Date": "2017-02-15", "Text": "Thank you. Today I have the honor of welcoming my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House. With this visit, the United States again reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our cherished ally, Israel. The partnership between our two countries built on our shared values has advanced the cause of human freedom, dignity, and peace. These are the building blocks of democracy.\nThe State of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression—I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone—and of survival in the face of genocide. We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured.\nYour perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds, is truly inspirational. The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about. One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal. My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing—I mean ever—a nuclear weapon.\nOur security assistance to Israel is currently at an alltime high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many. Both of our countries will continue and grow. We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life. America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life.\nThis is one more reason why we reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations—just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly—or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel. Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability. That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal. We'll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also, something we want to do. But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement. We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them.\nAs with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises. You know that, right? [Laughter]\nI want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism. As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts. Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten.\nThose are the ideals to which we all—and will always—aspire and commit. This will be the first of many productive meetings. And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today.\nThank you. Again, thank you.\nWe'll take a couple of questions. David Brody, that's Christian Broadcasting. David.\nMichael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media, in many cases. And I think it's really a sad thing that he was treated so badly. I think, in addition to that, from intelligence—papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. It's criminal action, criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time, before me. But now it's really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.\nI think it's very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally—I stress that—illegally leaked. Very, very unfair.\nAs far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out. But I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every President would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn't possible, because they didn't do it.\nBut Bibi and I have known each other a long time, a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So let's see what we do.\nDoesn't sound too optimistic, but that's—[laughter]. He's a good negotiator.\nI also want to thank—I also want to thank—Sara, could you please stand up? You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania. I appreciate it very much. Thank you.\nYour turn.\nSo I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. [Laughter] I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians—if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.\nAs far as the Embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with great care—great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens. Okay?\nAnd we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before. And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense. It would take in many, many countries, and it would cover a very large territory. So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's—now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing, and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this. So we'll see how that works out.\nKatie from Townhall [Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com]. Where's Katie? Right there. Katie.\nArab-Israeli Peace ProcessQ.Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal. You've mentioned a halt on settlements. Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians?\nAnd, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months, but the past couple of years as well?\nIt's actually an interesting question. I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard; it's hard to do. They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal. I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with. And I think they'll do that.\nI think they very much would like to make a deal, or I wouldn't be happy, and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am. I really think they—I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal.\nI think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age. They're taught tremendous hate. I've seen what they're taught. And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age, and it starts in the school room. And they have to acknowledge Israel; they're going to have to do that. There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country. And I think they're going to be willing to do that also. But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done.\nOkay? Thank you. Very interesting question. Thank you.\nGreat. Do you have somebody?\nWell, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had—306 electoral college votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there's no way to 270. And there's tremendous enthusiasm out there.\nI will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that's going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time.\nI think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation. Very divided. And hopefully, I'll be able to do something about that. And I—you know, it was something that was very important to me.\nAs far as people—Jewish people—so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next 3, 4, or 8 years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and you're going to see a lot of love. You're going to see a lot of love. Okay? Thank you.\nThank you very much. Very nice. I appreciate that very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-israel"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2017-02-16", "Text": "Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student. Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation—three times, confirmed—did very, very well. And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be—I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.\nAnd also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, a former Congressman, has just been approved—weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, \"Never Trump.\" And Paul just left, and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party, and hopefully, we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.\nI think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time, we were—we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic, in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.\nAnd then, right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions. Unless you have no questions; that's always a possibility.\nI'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last 4 weeks since my Inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.\nA new Rasmussen poll, in fact—because the people get it; much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is—to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that's good. Now it means that's good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league: Ford, General Motors, so many of them.\nI'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present—which is an honor to have you this morning—because many of our Nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward, we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, DC, along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people—tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press, honestly, is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\nI ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is, we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort—not all the time—and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic. But much of it is not, they—the distortion. And we'll talk about it; you'll be able to ask me questions about it.\nBut we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here, again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across Government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess—it's a mess—at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places: low pay, low wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look: the Middle East, a disaster; North Korea. We'll take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know: I inherited a mess.\nBeginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders—much of it you've covered—to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, of which there are many.\nWe've had great conversations with the United Kingdom—and meetings—Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. Very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.\nI have directed our defense community, headed by our great General, now Secretary Mattis—he's over there now, working very hard—to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group; now it's in large sections of the world. They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer, another mess I inherited.\nAnd we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who's totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism. And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now. It's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.\nI've ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I've had great support from the Senate. I've had great support from Congress, generally. We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you, that is my—I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it—I talked about it at every stop. Depleted—it's depleted. It won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it's peace through strength.\nAt home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the Government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders. Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised—\"Oh, he—having strong borders.\" Well, that's what I've been talking about to the press and everybody else.\nOne promise after another, after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons. And then, coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.\nI'm here, following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before. So that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.\nIn other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason. And—but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida, 5 o'clock on Saturday, and I heard—just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.\nI turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos—chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved, and they're outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coats who's there—one of the most respected men of the Senate—he can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague, highly respected, brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval.\nSo we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about, and we can't let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have—all you have to do is look at where they are right now—the only thing they can do is delay, because they've screwed things up royally, believe me.\nLet me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we'll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.\nWe've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals, but we're going to have one-on-one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one-on-one deals.\nWe've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit—it's many, many years—and then, at the end of the process—they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense—and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it's going to be a quick rejection, not going to take years. But mostly, it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries.\nWe've imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential Federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new Federal regulations. We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries, and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental—all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.\nWe've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing Federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a Task Force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation—take a look at Chicago and others—taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we're not going to let it happen any longer.\nWe've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our Nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary Kelly yesterday, and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the Government. And we're going to have a wall that works. We're not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.\nWe've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with Federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we've ordered an end to the policy of catch-and-release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are—release. We've begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day—court system has not made it easy for us—and are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.\nWe've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge's, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe—including reporters safe—and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that.\nExtreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a Circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I've heard 80 percent—I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard—that they're overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that Circuit is—that Circuit is in chaos, and that Circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.\nWe're issuing a new executive XE \"Subject: Immigration and naturalization : Foreign nationals and refugees, U.S. admission policy\" action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and, hopefully, winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.\nWe've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines—thousands and thousands of jobs—and put new \"buy American\" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of Government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn't say that. And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea. We put it in.\nTo drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, DC, I've started by imposing a 5-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It's a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare—I mean, they fill up our rallies with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our Representatives are representing. So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. Going to bring our jobs back to this country, big league. It's already happening, but big league.\nI've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson—is out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.\nAmong their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade—not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore. Now, every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.\nJobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know. You were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.\nIntel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. And there will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we're naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades—decades and decades and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.\nAnd one more thing: I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution. Highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that, but he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.\nThis last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it: There has never been a Presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven't even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Got some very big things are going to be announced next week.\nSo we're just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.\nMara [Mara Liasson, NPR]. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.\nMike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who—there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.\nHe didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this—they know nothing about it. They weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It's all fake news. It's all fake news.\nThe nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara—and I think it's very important—the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that's nice. Spoke to the President of Mexico. I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place.\nThe same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I'm saying—the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed. Yes, go ahead.\nBecause when I looked at the information, I said, I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that's fine; that's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be—and he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways—I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.\nYou know, he was just doing his job. But the thing is, he didn't tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.\nBut he didn't tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.\nYes, well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long, front page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was—it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story—I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really—I mean, they were such a minor part, they—I hadn't spoken to them. I think the one person, I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.\nThe other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call, look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he'd represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia—but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way—who's, by the way, a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine Government, or somebody. But everybody—people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people—and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it, because that's not good for their stories.\nSo the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the Inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that's the extent.\nRussia is fake news. Russia, this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration, because they're there—because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now—taken control of the CIA; James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a Senator, and a highly respected one. And he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.\nAnd just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: \"Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community\"—this was just given to us—\"is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.\"\nSo they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal—top—and they just wrote the story, that it's not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I've never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in the New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me: front page, big massive story. And it was nasty.\nAnd then, they called. They said, \"We never said that. We like Mr. Trump.\" They called up my office—we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally—they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you—totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And frankly, I then went on to other things.\nOkay, go ahead.\nYou okay?\nWell, I'm talking about Republican. Yes.\nYes.\nWell, no, I was told—I was given that information. I don't know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin.\nWell, I don't know. I was given that information. I was given—I've, actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?\nOkay, thank you. [Laughter] I—that's, good answer. Yes.\nGood, sure.\nWe are.\nWell, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats—hopefully, soon—Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position. So I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we'll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.\nAs far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came—Don McGahn, White House Counsel—and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong. Really didn't think—it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either, because I waited a period of time, and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don't see—to me, he was doing the job.\nThe information was provided by—who I don't know, Sally Yates—and I was a little surprised, because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call—in fact, I've watched various programs, and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out, he was just doing his job.\nSo—and I do—and by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.\nYes, Jon.\nYes, go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.\nWell, the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said; you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake, because so much of the news is fake.\nSo one thing that I felt it was very important to do—and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for—well, maybe a little bit, but—than reporters, than good reporters. It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true. And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes, and you'll write badly, and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN—it's so much anger and hatred, and just the hatred. I don't watch it anymore because it's very good—he's saying no. It's okay, Jim. It's okay, Jim. You'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one, so don't feel badly.\nBut I think it should be straight. I think it should be—I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now, but I think they'd actually be—I think they'd actually be better. People—I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter [Alexander, NBC News], is that one right? Because, you know, I think they have lower—I heard, lower than Congress.\nBut honestly, the public would appreciate it. I'd appreciate it. Again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we're setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking—some of them had them approved immediately. I'm going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for.\nAnd that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they'd be better served by approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean—I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that's okay. That's fine.\nBut I think it would—I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it.\nYes, go ahead, Jim.\nWell, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.\nNow, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give—they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff—what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates—which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.\nCan you imagine—seriously—can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair—[laughter]—okay? \"He should be put in the electric\"—you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, Jon.\nYes, we'll do you next, Jim. I'll do you next. Yes, yes?\nSure.\nNo, I didn't. No, I didn't.\nNo, I didn't. But Mike——\nExcuse me. No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it. I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.\nAnd it came out that way—and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job. And I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.\nNo, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it, okay?\nJim [Jim Acosta, CNN].\nOkay.\nAsk Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?\nWell, not too many. We do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.\nOkay. Go ahead, Jim.\nI was okay with it.\nWell, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that's okay.\nNo, no, but I did say 30, but it was actually higher than that.\nOkay, fair question. Ready?\nNo, no, but are you—let me do one at a time.\nDo you mind?\nNo, the reporting is fake.\nJim, you know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't—they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false, because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.\nI just see many, many untruthful things. And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word \"tone.\" The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such—I do get good ratings, you have to admit that. The tone is such hatred.\nI watched this morning, a couple of the networks, and I have to say \"Fox & Friends\" in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very—not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look—the hatred. The—I mean, sometimes——\nNo, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure. [Laughter]\nBut I am having a good time. Tomorrow they will say, \"Donald Trump rants and raves at the press.\" I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you, you're dishonest people. But I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: \"Donald Trump Rants and Raves.\" I'm not ranting and raving.\nGo ahead.\nShould I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter?\nPeter, should I have let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down.\nWe'll get it.\nI'm changing it from fake news though.\nVery fake news now. [Laughter]\nOkay, go ahead.\nI looked—you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. [Laughter]\nNo, I checked it. I said—they said, no, sir. I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. [Laughter]\nI do that. No, I do that.\nNo, no, I do it.\nHere's the thing.\nOkay, I understand—and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes, I'll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I'll get killed. I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad.\nAnd when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive. Sometimes, something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it, so—because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who is saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.\nLook, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press—the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know. But they don't believe you.\nIf you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster; I would be your biggest fan in the world—including bad stories about me. But if you go—as an example, you're CNN—I mean, it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing: chaos. There's zero chaos. We are running—this is a fine-tuned machine. And Reince happens to be doing a good job. But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.\nI said to him yesterday, they—you know, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks. But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying, here's my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, we won the election, right? We won the Presidency. We got some Senators. We got some—all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know—and I said to somebody that was in the room—I said, you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care. He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. Now, I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody, for whatever reason. But—and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair. And that's why the public sees it—they see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows, and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart. They understand it.\nOkay, yes, go ahead. Go ahead.\nRussia-U.S. Relations\nI think they don't believe it. I don't think the public believes. That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now, tomorrow you'll say, \"Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia; this is terrible.\" It's not terrible, it's good.\nWe had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons and other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton—that was a reset. Remember? It said \"reset.\"\nNow, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me. Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great. That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.\nNow, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So if I can—now, I love to negotiate things. I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people—the false, horrible, fake reporting—makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably, Putin said, you know—he's sitting behind his desk, and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story. Okay? And that's a shame. Because if we could get along with Russia—and by the way, China and Japan and everyone—if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.Tax Reform/Health Care Reform\nTax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare; we're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like—frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March. And after that, we're going to come up—and we're doing very well on tax reform.\nOkay.\nNot good.\nNot good, not good.\nNot good.\n——excuse me, when did it happen? It happened when—if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States. There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the public—you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say—you would say—oh, isn't that wonderful. But I know you well enough. Then, you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that. Look, all of the things——\nWait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.\nAll of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people. Go ahead.\nJust the way I said it.\nI have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.\nNo, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.\nNow, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might; we might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough—the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.\nIf Russia and the United States actually got together and got along—and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. I've been briefed. And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say, because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are we.\nIf we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\nWho did I say is not good?\nNo, it's not good, but they happened.\nThey all happened recently.\nThey all happened recently, and I understand what they're doing, because they're doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay.\nBut I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia.\nI gave—you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.\nYes, I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in 4 months. \"We are going to attack Mosul in 4 months.\" Then, 3 months later: \"We are going to attack Mosul in 1 month.\" \"Next week, we are going to attack Mosul.\" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because—I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things. You're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.\nI don't want to be one of these guys that say, \"Yes, here's what we're going to do.\" I don't have to do that.\nWait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship—the Russian ship, as an example—I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything. But I'm not going to tell you. Okay.\nWhere are you from?\nOkay. Here's another beauty. [Laughter]\nYes, sure.\nJust like CNN, right?\nWait, wait, wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned—again, maybe wrong, but I think it's 80 percent of the time. A lot. We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new Executive order next week sometime. But we had a bad decision. That's the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.\nYou had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that, the only problem that we had is, we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us, what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.\nNow, what I wanted to do was do the exact same Executive order, but said one thing—and I said this to my people: Give them a 1-month period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month—the bad ones. You do agree, there are bad people out there, right? They're not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.\nSo Kelly said, you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it. I said, how about 1 week? He said, no good. You've got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don't have time to come in. Now, nobody ever reports that, but that's why we did it quickly.\nNow, if I would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problem is, we would have wasted a lot of time and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.\nNow, in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help, and we need help by getting that Executive order passed.\nYes, go ahead.\nWell, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been——\nNo, no, nobody that I know of. Nobody——\nLook, look, how many times do I have to answer this question?\nRussia is a ruse. Yes, I know you have to get up and ask a question—so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't, I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election—I told you this—and he called me on the Inauguration a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one—lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it, because it was classified, so I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.\nNow, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine or people that—whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.\nI have—you know what, he said no. I can only tell you what he—now, he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also, by the way—Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.\nHow much longer should we stay here, folks? Five more minutes, is that okay? Five?\nWait, let's see, who's—I want to find a friendly reporter. Used to say it was Joe—are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait, wait—watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nThank you.\nYou see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not. It's not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question. So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism—the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.\nQuiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about—he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something—that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question, because people that know me—and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday—did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.\nSo you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.\nYes, go ahead. Go ahead.\nSee, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.\nGood.\nGood.\nYes.\nIt's a very fair question.\nRight.\nWe're going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases—not in all cases. In some of the cases, they're having DACA, and they're gang members, and they're drug dealers too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids—I would say mostly—they were brought here in such a way—it's a very, very tough subject.\nWe are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.\nBut the DACA situation is a very, very—it's a very difficult thing for me. Because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know, the law is rough. I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law is very rough. It's very, very rough.\nAs far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the—what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new Executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay?\nYes.\nNow, that's what I call a nice question. [Laughter] That is very nice. Who are you with?\nGood. I'm going to start watching, all right. Thank you very much.\nMelania is terrific. She was here last night. We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba, because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans. And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding. That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center, in other words, touring of the White House.\nShe, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties—very, very strongly. And she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets so unfairly maligned. The things they say—I've known her for a long time. She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say—and I've known her for a long time—the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.\nI'd just tell you this: I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money. They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because they feel it, both of them. And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school—because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left—she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Okay, thank you. That's a very nice question. Go ahead.\nYes. Hi—oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's okay.\nGood, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.\nThe President's Urban Policy Agenda/Congressional Black Caucus/Representative Elijah E. Cummings\nFix the inner cities, right?\nThat was very professional and very good.\nYes, well, we'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it will be something, I think, that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.\nAs far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did much higher than people thought I was going to get, and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.\nSo we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities: having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible—you know it takes a long time. It's taken a hundred years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved, many of them, very badly.\nBut we're going to be working very hard on health and health care, very, very hard on education. And also, we're going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people—and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it. In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So we're going to be very, very strong.\nIt's a great question, and it's a very difficult situation, because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there—Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they're living in hell.\nI mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all, and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about and that you talk about every night on the newscasts. So we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.\nAm I going include who?\nWell, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?\nDo you want to set up the meeting?\nAre they friends of yours?\nNo, go ahead, set up the meeting.\nLet's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great—the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can't—move it—might be bad for me politically, I can't have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone. Very nice guy.\nHe wanted it. But we called, called, called—they can't make a meeting with him. Every day, I walk in, I said, I would like to meet with him. Because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that—some other lightweight—[laughter]—he was probably told—he was probably told, don't meet with Trump, it's bad politics. And that's part of the problem in this country.\nOkay, one more. Go ahead.\nNo, no. One question. Two, we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.\nAnd some of it—and can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump; they're put up by the other side, and you think it's, like, playing it straight. No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs, and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay.\nGo ahead.\nPolitical Tensions in the U. S.\nWho is that? Where is that? Oh, stand up. You can——\nOh, I'm working on it. No, I'm working on it very hard.\nNo, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for 8 years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama. Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided—I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.\nWe're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked—I thought it was a very good question—was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education. We're going to work on lack—you know, we're going to stop—we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials. We're going to try and stop crime. We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime.\nBut it's very important to me. But this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went 8 years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try—I will do everything within my power—to fix that.\nI want to thank everybody very much. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1138"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany", "Date": "2017-03-17", "Text": "Thank you very much. Chancellor Merkel, it is a great honor to welcome you to the people's house, the White House. Our two nations share much in common, including our desire for security, prosperity, and peace.\nWe just concluded a productive meeting with the German and American companies to discuss workforce development and vocational training. Very important words. Germany has done an incredible job training the employees and future employees and employing its manufacturing and industrial workforce. It's crucial that we provide our American workers with a really great employment outlook, and that includes making sure that we harness the full potential of women in our economy.\nMy administration is in the process of rebuilding the American industrial base. A stronger America is in the interests, believe me, of the world as a whole. I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO, as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States. These nations must pay what they owe.\nDuring our meeting, I thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German Government's commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing at least 2 percent of GDP. I want to thank the Chancellor for her leadership in supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan. This has come at significant cost, including the lives of over 50 German soldiers, whose sacrifice we greatly honor.\nI also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership, along with the French President, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.\nMost importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS. I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member.\nWe also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.\nOver lunch, the Chancellor and I will talk about our economic partnership. We must work together towards fair and reciprocal trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. Millions of hard-working U.S. citizens have been left behind by international commerce, and together, we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial security.\nThe United States will respect historic institutions, and we will also recognize the right of free people to manage their own destiny.\nThe close friendship between America and Germany is built on our shared values. We cherish individual rights, we uphold the rule of law, and we seek peace among nations. Our alliance is a symbol of strength and cooperation to the world. It is the foundation of a very, very hopeful future. Thank you.\nThank you very much. We'll do a couple of questions.\nMark Halperin [NBC News].\nThank you, Mark. We just have a really wonderful group of people meeting later. We met with 12 pretty much \"noes\" in Congress—you saw that a little while ago—and they went from all \"noes\" to all \"yeses.\" And we have a lot of \"yeses\" coming in. It's all coming together. We're going to have great health care. It's going to be passed, I believe, I think substantially and pretty quickly. It's coming together beautifully. You have conservative groups; you have other groups. Everybody wants certain things. In the end, we're going to have a great health care plan.\nNow, I have to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster. It's failing. I was in Tennessee—we had a tremendous crowd the other night—and they have half of the State is uncovered. The insurance companies have left, and the other half has one insurance company, and that will probably be bailing out pretty soon also. They'll have nobody. You have many States where they have one. You have a lot of places now where they'll have none. Obamacare will fail. It will fold. It will close up very, very soon if something isn't done.\nI've often said politically, the best thing I can do is absolutely nothing. Wait 1 year and then even the Democrats will come say, please, please, you got to help us. But it's not the right thing to do for the people. We have a great plan. We have a plan that's getting more and more popular with the Republican base, with the conservative base, and with people generally. The press has covered it very inaccurately. People are truly covered well, and I think it's going to be something that's going to be a model to be looked upon.\nI'll tell you after we're finished. [Laughter]\nShould I go first? [Laughter] Nice, friendly reporter. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy, but I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy. And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years. And that's going to stop.\nBut I'm not an isolationist. I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader. And our free trade has led to a lot of bad things happening; you look at the deficits that we have, and you look at all of the accumulation of debt. We're a very powerful company—country. We're a very strong, very strong country. We'll soon be at a level that we perhaps have never been before. Our military is going to be strengthened; it's been depleted. But I am a trader. I am a fair trader. I am a trader that wants to see good for everybody, worldwide. But I am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination. So I don't know what newspaper you're reading, but I guess that would be another example of, as you say, fake news. Okay.\nI might add that we have many plants and factories coming back into the United States. Many jobs are coming back to Michigan, to Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to a lot of places where they were losing jobs. And we will have a different policy, but it's going to be a great policy for not only the United States, but a great policy worldwide, and I look very much forward to it.\nKevin Cirilli [Bloomberg].\nWell, Kevin, I think we have a very unified Republican Party. After all, we have the Presidency, we have the House, we have the Senate. And we're getting along very well, I will tell you. And if you were at the meeting that I just attended where we took 12 \"noes\" or semi-\"noes,\" no \"yeses,\" and within a short period of time, everybody was very much on board, and a commitment to vote \"yes\".\nI think we have a very unified party. I think we're actually more unified than even the election. You see—when they talk about me, I seem to be very popular, at least this week, within the party, because we have our highest numbers—the highest numbers that I've ever had in the party. So I think there's a great unification.\nNow, health care is a very, very difficult subject; it's a very complex subject. And it's a subject that goes both ways. You do something for one side, and the other side doesn't like it. But it's really something that's come together very well, and I think it's going to be very, very popular, extremely popular.\nOn trade with Germany, I think we're going to do fantastically well. Right now I would say that the negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the United States. But hopefully, we can even it out. We don't want victory; we want fairness. All I want is fairness.\nGermany has done very well in its trade deals with the United States, and I give them credit for it, but—and I can speak to many other countries. I mean, you look at China; you look at virtually any country that we do business with. It's not exactly what you call good for our workers.\nI mean, you look at the horrible NAFTA transaction; NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States. It's been a disaster for companies, and in particular, it's been a disaster for the workers. A lot of the companies just moved, but the workers are screwed. And it's probably the reason I'm standing here, maybe number one; that and maybe the military, building up our military, which we will do, and we will be stronger than ever before and, hopefully, not have to use it. But we will be stronger, and perhaps far stronger than ever before. But it's probably the reason I'm here, is when you talk about trade.\nSo I think that we are going to be a very different country. I think we're going to be—we're going to have great values. But in terms of our military, it's going to be much stronger. And our trade deals are going to be good, solid deals. Not deals that lead to closing plants and tremendous unemployment.\nOkay? Thank you. Yes, ma'am.\nVery seldom.\nVery seldom. Probably wouldn't be here right now—but very seldom. We have a tremendous group of people that listen, and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that.\nAs far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common perhaps. [Laughter] And just to finish your question, we said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. And so you shouldn't be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox, okay?\nThank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-chancellor-angela-merkel-germany-5"}

I would not be at all surprised if we did something that would be very dramatic and good for both countries and I hope so.\nYes, we will talk about North Korea. And China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone.\nI think trade is the incentive. It is all about trade.\nBy telling China that we cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now. This is an unfair deal.\nI don't want to talk about tariffs yet, perhaps the next time we meet. So I don't want to talk about tariffs yet. But you used the word equalise. That is a very good word because they are not equalised. If you used a word other than tariff, it is not an equal. You know when you talk about, when you talk about currency manipulation, when you talk about devaluations, they are world champions. And our country hasn't had a clue, they haven't had a clue. The past administration hasn't had and many administrations — I don't want to say only Obama; this has gone on for many years — they haven't had a clue. But I do.\nWell, if China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you.\nTotally.\nI don't have to say any more. Totally.\nI'm not going to tell you. You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East. Where they say — I used it in the speeches — 'We will be attacking Mosul in four months'. A month later, 'We will be attacking Mosul in three months, in two months, in one month'. And why are they talking? There is no reason to talk.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lionel-barber-demetri-sevastopulo-and-gillian-tett-the-financial-times"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With King Abdullah II of Jordan", "Date": "2017-04-05", "Text": "Thank you very much. Your Majesty, thank you for being with us today. Very much appreciate it. This is our second meeting since my Inauguration, but our first at the White House. A very special place, I can tell you that. I've gotten to know it well. Long hours. Very special.\nIt's really an honor to welcome you here today. But before we begin, let me say a few words about recent events.\nYesterday chemical attack—a chemical attack that was so horrific, in Syria, against innocent people, including women, small children, and even beautiful little babies. Their deaths was an affront to humanity. These heinous actions by the Asad regime cannot be tolerated. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this horrific attack and all other horrific attacks, for that matter.\nJordan-U.S. Relations\nYour Majesty, Jordanians are known for their legendary hospitality, and we will do our very best to be equally gracious hosts. They're also known, however—I have to say this—for their fighting ability. And you are a great warrior, and we appreciate it. Thank you.\nThe historical ties and close friendship between our two countries dates back three-quarters of a century. In that time, the Middle East has faced many periods of crisis and unrest, perhaps never like it is today, however. Through them all, America has looked to Jordan as a valued partner, an advocate for the values of civilization, and a source of stability and hope.\nI am deeply committed to preserving our strong relationship—which I will—and to strengthening America's longstanding support for Jordan. And you do have tremendous support within our country, I can tell you that.\nAs we know, the Middle East—and the entire world—is faced with one of its gravest threats in many, many years. Since the earliest days of the campaign against ISIS, Jordan has been a staunch ally and partner, and we thank you for that. Jordanian servicemembers have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilization, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage. So many have been lost, and we pay homage. So many.\nIn King Abdullah, America is blessed with a thoughtful and determined partner. He is a man who has spent years commanding his country's special forces. He really knows what being a soldier is, that I can tell you. And he knows how to fight. The King has been a leader in calling for a plan to defeat ISIS once and for all. And I'm with you on that. We're both leaders on that, believe me. That's what we speak about today, and that is what we are going to do. And it will be a shorter fight than a lot of people are thinking about, believe me. We've made tremendous strides, as we discussed. As you know, we had a very, very fine delegation come over from Egypt and also from Iraq, and they said more has been done in the last 6 weeks than has been done in years with the previous administration. And believe me, we're going to keep it that way.\nWe will destroy ISIS, and we will protect civilization. We have no choice. We will protect civilization. King Abdullah and I also discussed measures to combat the evil and ideology that inspires ISIS and plagues our planet. In addition, we also acknowledged the vital role that Jordan has played in hosting refugees from the conflict in Syria. We have just announced that the United States will contribute additional funds to Jordan for humanitarian assistance. This aid will help countries like Jordan host refugees until it is safe for them to return home. The refugees want to return home. I know that from so many other instances. They want to return back to their home. And that's a goal of any responsible refugee policy.\nFinally, as we discussed, to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. And I'm working very, very hard on trying to finally create peace between the Palestinians and Israel, and I think we'll be successful. I hope to be successful, I can tell you that.\nThe King has been an entire—a really tireless advocate for a solution, and he's going to help me with that and help me at the highest level. And we will be consulting with him very closely in the days ahead.\nKing Abdullah, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your partnership. Working together, the United States and Jordan can help bring peace and stability to the Middle East and, in fact, the entire world. And we will do that.\nThank you very, very much for being with us. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you very much.\nWell, I think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand. And when he didn't cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world, because it was a blank threat. I think it was something that was not one of our better days as a country.\nSo I do feel that, Julie. I feel it very strongly.\nI now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly, I will tell you that. It is now my responsibility. It was a great opportunity missed. As you know, I'll be meeting with the President of China very soon, in Florida. And that's another responsibility we have, and that's called the country of North Korea. We have a big problem. We have somebody that is not doing the right thing. And that's going to be my responsibility. But I'll tell you, that responsibility could have made—been made a lot easier if it was handled years ago.\nIt crossed a lot of lines for me. When you kill innocent children, innocent babies—babies, little babies—with a chemical gas that is so lethal—people were shocked to hear what gas it was—that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines.\nThank you very much.\nThank you. John Yang [PBS NewsHour].\nI like to think of myself as a very flexible person. I don't have to have one specific way, and if the world changes, I go the same way, I don't change. Well, I do change, and I am flexible, and I'm proud of that flexibility. And I will tell you, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me—big impact. That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I've been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn't get any worse than that.\nAnd I have that flexibility, and it's very, very possible—and I will tell you, it's already happened—that my attitude toward Syria and Asad has changed very much. And if you look back over the last few weeks, there were other attacks using gas. You're now talking about a whole different level.\nSo, as you know, I would love to have never been in the Middle East. I would love to have never seen that whole big situation start. But once it started, we got out the wrong way, and ISIS formed in the vacuum, and lots of bad things happened. I will tell you, what happened yesterday is unacceptable to me.\nWell, one of the things I think you've noticed about me is, militarily, I don't like to say where I'm going and what I'm doing. And I watched past administrations say, we will attack at such and such a day at such and such an hour. And you, being a warrior—you would say, why are they saying that? And I'm sure you sat back in Jordan, and you said, why are they saying that?\nI watched Mosul, where the past administration was saying, we will be attacking in 4 months. And I said, why are they doing that? Then, a month goes by, and they say, we will be attacking in 3 months, and then 2 months, and then we will be attacking next week. And I'm\nsaying, why are they doing that? And as you know, Mosul turned out to be a much harder fight than anyone thought, and a lot of people have been lost in that fight.\nI'm not saying I'm doing anything one way or the other, but I'm certainly not going to be telling you, as much as I respect you, John. [Laughter] Thank you.\nAnd I have to just say that the world is a mess. I inherited a mess. Whether it's the Middle East, whether it's North Korea, whether it's so many other things, whether it's in our country—horrible trade deals—I inherited a mess. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix it.\nThe Iran deal made by the previous administration is one of the worst deals I have ever witnessed, and I've witnessed some beauties. It's one of the worst deals I've ever witnessed. It should never have been made. It was totally one-sided against the United States and, frankly, against much of the Middle East.\nI will do whatever I have to do. They have a deal. It was, some people say, not done properly even in the form of its finalization. There was no vote from Congress. There was no real ratification. But I will do what I have to do with respect to the Iran deal.\nAs far as ISIS is concerned, the United States will work with whoever it's appropriate to work with to totally eradicate ISIS and other terrorists. And by the way, ISIS is one group, but others have formed. Frankly, they're all over the place. We will do what we have to do to eradicate terrorism.\nYes.\nYou will see. They will have a message. You will see what the message will be. Okay? Thank you.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-king-abdullah-ii-jordan-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network", "Date": "2017-04-11", "Text": "For them, at some point very soon, I think we're doing very well on health care. It's been very much miss reported that we failed with health care. We haven't failed, we're negotiating and we continue to negotiate and we will save perhaps nine hundred billion dollars. You know if you look at, if you look at the kind of numbers that we're talking about, that's all going back into the taxes. We have to do healthcare first to pick up additional money so that we get great tax reform. So, we're going to have a phenomenal tax reform. But, I have to do healthcare first. I want to do it first, to really do it right. Health care has been going along you know it's a negotiation so I do. And it's just a negotiation. And it's going to take a little while longer but as you probably hear in Congress is coming along with some great people at congress. They want it to happen. We will have no Democrats. Zero. That means we have to get close to a hundred percent of the Republicans. Not an easy way to run a government. You saw that with Justice Gossage which is we're very proud of but he had no almost no democrat support even though he was central casting like the perfect Supreme Court Judge. So, we'll see what happens. I think we're doing very well with health care which surprises us like breaking news but they all know it they just don't tend to write it and after that we're going to start on tax reform and infrastructure.\nThey're all right but because I'm saving a tremendous amount hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars we're saving on health care so we're going to have a much better plan than Obamacare, which is failing. Even now, as I came in here, they're saying payments have to be made that weren't scheduled to be made on Obamacare. If you don't make them, it fails. I mean you know it's just a mess. Obamacare is a total mess so we're saving tremendous amounts of money on health care when we get this done, number one. And most importantly actually, we're going to have great health care. And all of that saving goes into the tax. If you don't do that, you can't put any of these savings into the tax cuts and the tax reform\nI think tax reform will be easier but it's going to be tough. You have a lot of people out there that what you know they have their own agendas including a lot of supporters of different people that are in Congress. They have their own agendas. They want certain things. Tax reform is going to be tough but it won't be as tough as healthcare. Healthcare is very very difficult. You look at that. Look at Hilary Clinton, that failed. And you look at so many of the others. Obamacare failed. Obamacare was just, you know, they just in the end just gave up just to get the vote. You look at what they had to do in Nebraska where they essentially gave it away for Nebraska to get that final vote\nMany many of the and this is going to be much worse year than last year for Obamacare. So Obamacare is a disaster. It's really gone, essentially it's gone. If Obamacare isn't bailed out almost on a monthly basis, it fails. It immediately fails. We have a great health care plan that I think will happen and if it happens then I go immediately to tax reform and that will happen. That will be easier than healthcare.\nI haven't really wanted to talk about it. I have my own feelings. I don't like the word adjustment because our country gets taken advantage of, to use a nice term, by every other country in the world. So when I hear border adjustment, adjustment means we lose, we lose so I don't like to turn border adjustment.\n[crosstalk] Countries, where they charge our companies a hundred percent tax. If they sell a motorcycle or if they sell they make it in America. They make it in the United States. They sell it to various countries. They sell very little because the tax is a hundred percent in some countries. The tax is fifty percent thirty percent forty percent. But if they make a motorcycle and they sell it back into the United States, they have no tax. Now do you think that's fair? And you think that's smart? So I love the idea of reciprocal. You can call it a reciprocal or a matching tax or a mere tax or numerous terms but the reciprocal tax is very important. And you know, the funny thing is that nobody gets angry when you say reciprocal tax. When you say we're going to charge your border tax. We'd be a rich nation if we did it by the way. But you know but when you say reciprocal nobody fights you. When you say I'm going to charge a ten percent or a 20-percent border tax everyone goes crazy because they like free trade. Well they don't say that the other countries are charging you much more than that. But when you say a reciprocal tax, and I'm not saying that's what I'm doing, but there has to be a certain reciprocal nature to it. But when you say reciprocal tax nobody can get angry. Even the other countries if like they're charging you a fifty percent tax you say okay whatever you charge we will charge\nYeah, we can keep trade and we can keep certain things separate. We may put it in the tax bill or we may make it separate. We have a lot of different things. Don't forget, we're going to be bringing back as part of this I think the number is closer to five trillion dollars. You know you've been hearing, you've been using, and you keep using two and a half trillion right? But the money the corporate inversions and the money over there is two and a half trillion dollars. So I think that money because we've been saying that number for what five years\nnow, would you say? So I know it's much more. It's probably five trillion dollars or four trillion dollars. That money is coming back. We're going to charge a very small tax on that money and the companies are going to bring that money back into the United States and do lots of good things with it. Right now they can't bring it back and it's not only the high-techs it's also because the bureaucracy is so horrible. I have friends that want to bring money back, even if they were willing to pay the tax which very few people are willing, the bureaucracy the paperwork the the work to get it in it's not worth it\nBoth. Both. I almost think individual from my standpoint because you know the middle class has just been taken advantage of in this country for so many years. But in terms of jobs I mean, I think, both. But I think probably corporate. But they gonna both go hand in hand. It's not going to matter.\nWell you know, I put a deadline on health care and the fake news immediately went crazy because when I didn't make the deadline don't forget I said withdraw I didn't even say take a vote I say withdraw. Well that same thing is being negotiated and great points are being won and lost. The great points are being won that are going to lower premiums and make our health care incredible. But by putting a deadline they say \"Trump didn't make it he didn't make it.\" So I don't want to put deadlines. Health care is going to happen at some point. Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do healthcare first\nVery soon. I see it as part perhaps of the health care plan because phase two of the health care plan, in order to get the votes, I need sixty percent for that and if I put that in the Democrats are actually going to love the infrastructure plan. So we're going to actually, I believe, despite their tremendous hostility for years this isn't just for Trump this is for years. It's been so hostile. You know, when I used to come to Washington, because I've been a very political person all my life even though I'm not on this side of the equation. But I've been very very political. I used to see Democrats and Republicans, they were best friends and they'd fight a little bit during the day and then they'd have dinner with their families at night you'd see them at restaurants. They used to joke look at this look at this and you know a Republican\nYeah, they'd be together. Have breakfast together, then they go and fight and then they have lunch. Today you don't see that. The level of hatred is incredible and I'm not just saying in the last 90 days, I'm saying this has been for the last few years. It's incredibly divisive\nWell, an example on health care, I won't get one Democrat vote even though many of them think it's an incredible plan. Take a look at Justice Gorsuch. You can't get better. Top of the line in every aspect and he got three votes from the Democrats. Should have gotten all of them. Got three votes and those three people, you know, are to be respected for doing it. But it's there's a great level of hostility and they're putting their putting their hatred way way above way above the country and the benefit to the country. You know, things that they do can have such benefit so I probably I always assume no Democrat votes. Now, the good thing is we have the house, we have the Senate, and we have the White House. So, we're all set. But within there, you have certain factions. You have the conservative Republicans. You have the modern Republican. Soon you have to get them together, but we need close to a hundred percent. That's a pretty hard thing to get but we get it.\nI'm going to build the wall one hundred percent. In fact, we had hundreds of bidders. We have many many designs. I've seen 10 of the top but I want to see more. And what I'm doing is I said to very great secretaries who are doing a great job General Kelly because you see the numbers where they're down sixty-eight percent. Nobody's ever seen numbers it's like on a record in fact people aren't even trying to get through anymore because they know they can't. It's incredible what's happened but on the wall we're looking at designs and we're going to be making a decision very shortly.\nWe've done an amazing job on regulations. We've freed it up, we freed up this country so much. The miners and energy and the banking system is now coming to with dodd-frank which is a disaster.\nWe freed up so much and we're getting great great credit for we have done so much for so many people. I don't think that there is a presidential period of time in the first 100 days where anyone's done merely what we've been able to do.\nOn top of it, we just had during the first 100 days a Supreme Court justice approved. Not just nominated, but approved to a very very hostile environment. I am waiting right now for so many people.\nHundreds and hundreds of people, and then they'll say why isn't Trump doing this faster? You can't do it faster because they are obstructing their obstructionists.\nSo I have people, hundreds of people, that we're trying to get through. I mean you have to see the backlog okay. Get them through and then the newspapers will say \"Trump doesn't get them through.\" Well, nothing to do with me statutorily.\nYou have to go through this process. So it's been a lousy process. It has taken a long time to get my cabinet done and as you know it's not even done now.\nThis is record stuff. You know we're talking about records in terms of time and it's it's very sad. Well, you see, even again with the Supreme Court judge that everybody agrees is outstanding and you see what that process is.\nI think they know. I think they get it. I wish it would be explained better. The obstruction is nature though because a lot of times I'll say why doesn't so and so have people under him or her. The reason is because we can't get them approved.\nNo, it's not too late. But you know I have confidence and we'll see what happen. You know it's, it's going to be interesting. But you know we have to just look. I have so many people that want to come into this administration. They're so excited about this administration and what's happening. Bankers, law enforcement, everybody wants to come into this administration. Don't forget when Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton. People don't realize that he saved her life because I call it Comey one, and I joke about it a little bit.\nWhen he was reading those charges, she was guilty on every charge and then he said she was essentially okay. Well,\nNo, I'm just saying well because I want to give everybody a good fair chance. Director Comey was very very good to Hillary Clinton that I can tell you. If he weren't, she would be right now going to trial\nI don't want to talk about that right now. All I want to talk about, I want to talk about positive\nWell, I'm going to let you figure that one out but it's so obvious, when you look at Susan Rice, of what's going on. And so many people are coming up to me and apologizing. Now they say, \"you know you were right when you said that.\" Perhaps I didn't know how right I was because nobody knew the extent of it\nWell, sure we're talking about surveillance. It was wiretapped. In quotes New York Times had the word wiretapped in the headline of the first edition. Then, they took it out of there fast when they realized I put wiretapped in quotes. Meaning, because look wiretapping is old fashioned. Again, that's too many wires. Any room will have a lot of wires. Look at this room. This room, you just have a lot of wires. Now it doesn't have to have so many wires but we talked about surveillance or whatever, and you look at the extent of the surveillance me and so many other people it's, it's terrible\nDoes anybody really believe that? Nobody believes that. Even the people that try to protect her in the news media. It's such a big story and I'm sure it will continue forward, but what they did is horrible.\nThat I don't know. I can't tell you. But I can tell you that I think aligning yourself with the Sun is a big mistake because he's a butcher. And I think it's very bad for Russia and I think they ought to get peace fast.\nWe're not going into Syria because you know there were some questions Nikki Haley's doing a great job Rex is doing a fantastic job our Secretary of State a general McMaster fantastic but if you add it all up and if they take every little word they'll say oh they were different. Just so you understand. We're not going into Syria. But when I see people using horrible horrible chemical weapons which they agreed not to use under the Obama administration but they violated it.\nWhen I looked he we didn't do it. I don't know what happened, but he didn't do it. In fact, they had a big attack right after he drew the red line in the sand. Had a very big attack and everybody waited. What's going on and nothing happened. And even the Obama people admitted he was wrong for not doing it. I will tell you that when I looked at the pictures on any show or any newspaper but especially when you see them on television and you see these beautiful kids that are dead in their father's arms or you see kids gasping for life, you know, it's over it's over for them. They're hosing them down. Hundreds of them. When you see that, I immediately called General Mattis. I said \"what can we do\" and they came back with a number of different alternatives and we hit them very hard. Now, are we going to get involved with Syria? No. But if I see them using gas and using things that I mean even some of the worst tyrants in the world didn't use the kind of gases that they use and some of the gases are unbelievably potent. So, when I saw that, I said we have to do something. You should have peace in Syria. It's enough and frankly you know we talked the chemicals because you know people just don't see this the level of brutality. The level of viciousness. But when they drop barrel bombs and bombs of any kind, right on top of a civilian population, that's the worst thing. I've never seen anything like it. And frankly Putin is back in a person that's truly an evil person and I think it's very bad for Russia. I think it's very bad for mankind. It's very bad for this world, but when you drop gas or bombs or barrel bombs. They have these massive barrels with dynamite and they drop it right in the middle of a group of people. And in all fairness, you see the same kids no arms, no legs, no face. This is an animal and I really think that there's going to be a lot of pressure on Russia to make sure that piece happens. Because, frankly, if Russia didn't go in and back this animal you wouldn't have a problem right now. He was going to be overthrown. I thought he was gone. He had another week. I mean he was finished. He had nothing nothing and then Russia came in and saved him and then Obama made one of the worst deals in history with the Iran deal. So you really have Iran and you have Russia and you have Assad.\nYou know I don't talk about the military. I'm not like Obama where they talk about in four months we're rating, we're going to hit Mosel and in the meantime they get ready. And like you never saw look but they're still fighting Mosel was supposed to last for a week. Now they've been fighting it for many months and so many more people died. I don't want to talk about it. We are sending an armada, very powerful. We have submarines, very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier that I can tell you. We have the best military people on earth and I will say this he is doing the wrong thing\nI don't know. I don't know. I don't know him, but he's doing the wrong thing. I had a very very good meeting with President Xi of China. Really liked him. We had a great chemistry. I think, I mean at least I had a great chemistry maybe he didn't like me but I think he liked me. We were going to have a 10 or 15 minutes sit down. It lasted for three hours. Then, the next day, it was another schedule because everything's very orderly with the Chinese frankly and we had meetings scheduled. Well, the 15 minutes on the first day lasted for three hours. The 15 minutes on the second day lasted for two hours just one-on-one the two of us with interpreters. And I mean we understand each other. I think he's, you know, a person that I got along with really. Where we had a good chemistry.\nFirst thing I brought up was North Korea. Can he help us with North Korea? Because we can't allow it and it's no good for you and you have a tremendous power because of train. He then explains thousands of years of history with Korea. Not that easy. In other words, it's not as simple as people would think. They've had tremendous conflict with Korea over the years. Now his father was in China four times. He was never in China. So I said look you have a tremendous power because of trading through the border. They don't get food. They don't get you know; they can't sell their coal. In fact, I hear today two massive coal ships from North Korea we sent back to North Korea heading to China. They were sent back which is a very good sign. But I think China can help us. I hope China can help us. We talked about trade and I can tell you china will do much better on trade if they help us\nI think he knows that. I told him that, yeah\nYou have no idea how many people want to hear the answer to this. I have had, I have watched speculation for three days now on what that was like.\nI will tell you only because you've treated me so good for so long I have to tell you, right? I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner, we're now having dessert and we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen. and President Xi was enjoying it and I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded.\nWhat do you do? And we made a determination to do it. So the missiles were on the way and I said \"Mr. President, let me explain something to you.\" This is during dessert. \"We've just fired 59 missiles\", all of which hit by the way. Unbelievable from you know hundreds of miles away all of which hit. Amazing. Really it's so incredible, it's brilliant, it's genius. Our technology, our equipment is better than anybody body by a factor of five. I mean what we have in terms of technology nobody can even come close to competing. Now, we're going to start getting it because you know the military has been cut back and depleted so badly by the past administration and by the war in Iraq. Which, was another disaster. So what happens as I said \"we've just launched 59 missiles heading to Iraq.\"\nYes, heading toward Syria and I want you to know that because I didn't want him to go home. We're almost finished. Was a full day in Palm Beach, we're almost finished and I what does he do finishes dessert and go home and then they say you know the guy who just had dinner with just attacked.\nSo, he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again. I didn't think that was a good sign. And he said to me \"anybody that uses gases, you could almost say or anything else, but anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that to young children and babies it's okay\"\nHe was okay with it. He was ok, but we get along. There was a great feeling I think between the both of us. Now, we have two very different countries, two very different peoples but I think he understood the message and I understood what he was saying to me.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-bartiromo-fox-business-network"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization", "Date": "2017-04-12", "Text": "Thank you. Secretary General Stoltenberg, it's a pleasure to welcome you to the White House, especially at such an important moment in our great alliance.\nI also want to acknowledge the great work being done by our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to strengthen the NATO alliance, as well as the Secretary's trip to Moscow to promote the security interest of the United States and its allies. He did a terrific job—just watched parts of it—did an absolutely terrific job.\nSixty-eight years ago this month, not far from where we are gathered today, President Harry Truman spoke at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. In the nearly seven decades since Harry Truman spoke those words, the NATO alliance has been the bulwark of international peace and security.\nNATO allies defeated communism and liberated the captive nations of the cold war. They secured the longest period of unbroken peace that Europe has ever known. This enduring partnership is rooted out of so many different things, but our common security is always number one, and our common devotion to human dignity and freedom.\nSince 1949, the NATO member states have more than doubled, increasing from 12 to 28. On Monday, I signed the protocol to approve the 29th, the country of Montenegro. In the coming months and years, I'll work closely with all of our NATO allies to enhance this partnership and to adapt to the challenges of the future, of which there will be many. This includes upgrading NATO to focus on today's most pressing security and all of its challenges, including migration and terrorism.\nWe must also work together to resolve the disaster currently taking place in Syria. We are grateful for the support of NATO members and partners in their condemnation of Asad's murderous attack, using the most horrible weapons. The vicious slaughter of innocent civilians with chemical weapons, including the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies, must be forcefully rejected by any nation that values human life. It is time to end this brutal civil war, defeat terrorists, and allow refugees to return home.\nIn facing our common challenges, we must also ensure that NATO members meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe. Many have not been doing that. The Secretary General and I agree that other member nations must satisfy their responsibility to contribute 2 percent of GDP to defense. If other countries pay their fair share, instead of relying on the United States to make up the difference, we will all be much more secure and our partnership will be made that much stronger.\nThe Secretary General and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete; it's no longer obsolete. It's my hope that NATO will take on an increased role in supporting our Iraqi partners in their battle against ISIS. I'm also sending General McMaster to Afghanistan to find out how we can make progress alongside our Afghan partners and NATO allies. Every generation has strived to adapt the NATO alliance to meet the challenges of their times, and on my visit to Brussels this spring, which I look very much forward to, we will work together to do the same. We must not be trapped by the tired thinking that so many have, but apply new solutions to face new circumstances. And that's all throughout the world. We're not here to stand on ceremony, but to develop real strategies to achieve safety, security, and peace. We're here to protect the freedom and prosperity of our citizens and to give them the future they so richly deserve.\nSecretary General, I'm honored to have you here today and to reaffirm our commitment to this alliance and to the enduring values that we proudly—and I mean, very proudly—share. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you.\nThank you very much. Great. Thank you.\nSo we'll have a couple of questions.\nJeff Mason [Reuters].\nRussia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations\nWell, I'll be speaking to—do you want to go ahead? Go ahead.\nExcuse me?\nWell, we'll see. We're going to see, we're going to see about that. And I'll also see about Putin over a period of time. It would be a fantastic thing if we got along with Putin and if we got along with Russia. And that could happen, and it may not happen; it may be just the opposite.\nI can only tell you what I would like to do. I would love to be able to get along with everybody. Right now the world is a mess. But I think by the time we finish, I think it's going to be a lot better place to live. And I can tell you that, speaking for myself, by the time I'm finished, it's going to be a lot better place to live in, because right now it's nasty.\nI like that question. [Laughter]\nI think it's certainly possible; I think it's probably unlikely. And I know they're doing investigations into that right now. I would like to think that they didn't know, but certainly, they could have. They were there. So we'll find out. General Mattis is looking into it with the entire Pentagon group that does that kind of work.\nSo I—it was very disappointing to see. It's disappointing no matter who does it, but when you get into the gases—especially that form—it's vicious and violent. And everybody in this room saw it all too many times over the last 3 or 4 days: young children dying, babies dying, fathers holding children in their arms that were dead. Dead children—there can't be a worse sight, and it shouldn't be allowed. That's a butcher. That's a butcher.\nSo I felt we had to do something about it. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing, and it was very, very successfully done, as you well know. Thank you.\nAnd I did ask about all the money that hasn't been paid over the years, will that money be coming back. We'll be talking about that, right? [Laughter] We want to talk about that too.\nAnita Kumar, where are you? Hi. McClatchy. Hi.\nWe did talk last night. I think it's wonderful that they abstained. As you know, very few people expected that. And no, I was not surprised that China did abstain. Very, very few people thought that that was going to happen. So we're honored by the vote. That's the vote that should have taken place.\nOkay.\nI cannot hear. I cannot understand——\nWell, I want to just start by saying, hopefully, they're going to have to fear nothing, ultimately. Right now there is a fear, and there are problems—there are certainly problems. But ultimately, I hope that there won't be a fear and there won't be problems and the world can get along. That would be the ideal situation.\nIt's crazy what's going on—whether it's the Middle East or you look at—no matter where—the Ukraine—you look at—whatever you look at, it's got problems, so many problems. And ultimately, I believe that we are going to get rid of most of those problems, and there won't be fear of anybody. That's the way it should be. We have a very big problem in North Korea. And as I said, I really think that China is going to try very hard, and has already started. A lot of the coal boats have already been turned back—you saw that yesterday and today—they've been turned back. The vast amount of coal that comes out of North Korea going to China, they've turned back the boats. That's a big step, and they have many other steps that I know about.\nSo we'll see what happens. It may be effective, it may not be effective. If it's not effective, we will be effective, I can promise you that. Thank you.\nOkay. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-secretary-general-jens-stoltenberg-the-north-atlantic"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy", "Date": "2017-04-20", "Text": "Thank you very much. Prime Minister Gentiloni, welcome. Great honor. Thank you.\nIt's wonderful to have you in our wonderful people's house, known as the White House. And so many great Italian friends are with us today. And we renew, always, the deep ties of history and friendship that link together the American and the Italian peoples. That history traces its roots to the timeless contributions of Italy to civilization and human progress—so true. Stretching all the way back to ancient Rome, through the ages, your country has been a beacon of artistic and scientific achievement—and that continues today—from Venice to Florence, from Verdi to Pavarotti, a friend of mine. Great friend of mine. These bonds of history and culture have only grown stronger as our two nations have become close partners, dear friends, and very vital allies.\nThank you very much, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nI'll take a few questions. John Roberts of Fox, please.\nI see that.\nWell, first of all, I love the question you asked the Prime Minister. I look forward to his answer—[laughter]—because I'm going to be asking him that same question very soon.\nWell, first of all, our condolences from our country to the people of France. Again, it's happening, it seems. I just saw it as I was walking in, so that's a terrible thing, and it's a very, very terrible thing that's going on in the world today. But it looks like another terrorist attack. And what can you say? It just never ends. We have to be strong, and we have to be vigilant. And I've been saying it for a long time.\nAs far as North Korea is concerned, we are in very good shape. And we're building our military rapidly. A lot of things have happened over the last short period of time. I've been here for approximately 91 days; we're doing a lot of work. We're in very good position. We're going to see what happens.\nI can't ask your—answer your question on stability. I hope the answer is a positive one, not a negative one. But hopefully, that will be something that gets taken care of. I have great respect for the President of China. As you know, we had a great summit in Florida, and Palm Beach, and got to know each other and, I think, like each other. I can say from my standpoint I liked him very much. I respect him very much. And I think he's working very hard.\nI can say that all of the pundits out there are saying they never have seen China work like they're working right now. Many coal ships have sent back. Many other things have happened. Some very unusual moves have been made over the last 2 or 3 hours. And I really have confidence that the President will try very hard. We don't know whether or not they're able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very, very hard. And one of the reasons that we're talking about trade deals and we're talking about all of the different things—but we're slowing up a little bit. I actually told him, I said, you'll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of North Korea. Because that's what it is, it's a menace right now.\nSo we'll see what happens. As far as Iran is concerned, I think they are doing a tremendous disservice to an agreement that was signed. It was a terrible agreement. It shouldn't have been signed. It shouldn't have been negotiated the way it was negotiated. I'm all for agreements, but that was a bad one, as bad as I've ever seen negotiated.\nThey are not living up to the spirit of the agreement, I can tell you that. And we're analyzing it very, very carefully, and we'll have something to say about it in the not-too-distant future. But Iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement. And they have to do that. They have to do that. So we will see what happens.\nThank you very much, John.\nYes, a strong Europe is very, very important to me as President of the United States. And it's also, in my opinion, in my very strong opinion, important for the United States. We want to see it. We will help it be strong, and it's very much to everybody's advantage. And I look very much forward to meeting the Pope.\nFabian of the Hill [Jordan Fabian, The Hill]. Fabian. Yes.\nOkay, I want to get both. [Laughter] Are you shocked to hear that? And we're doing very well on health care. We'll see what happens. But this is a great bill. There's a great plan. And this will be great health care. It's evolving. You know, there was never a give-up. The press sort of reported there was, like, a give-up. There's no give-up. We started. Remember, it took Obamacare 17 months. I've really been negotiating this for 2 months, maybe even less than that, because we had a 30-day period where we did lots of other things the first 30 days.\nBut this has really been 2 months. And this is a continuation. And the plan gets better and better and better. And it's gotten really, really good. And a lot of people are liking it a lot. We have a good chance of getting it soon. I'd like to say next week, but it will be—I believe we will get it. And whether it's next week or shortly thereafter. As far as keeping the Government open, I think we want to keep the Government open. Don't you agree? So, yes, I think we'll get both. Thank you.\n[Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nI do not see a role in Libya. I think the United States has right now enough roles. We're in a role everywhere. So I do not see that. I do see a role in getting rid of ISIS. We're being very effective in that regard. We are doing a job, with respect to ISIS, that has not been done anywhere near the numbers that we're producing right now. It's a very effective force we have. We have no choice. It's a horrible thing to say, but we have no choice.\nAnd we are effectively ridding the world of ISIS. I see that as a primary role, and that's what we're going to do, whether it's in Iraq or in Libya or anywhere else. And that role will come to an end at a certain point, and we'll be able to go back home and rebuild our country, which is what I want to do.\nThank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-paolo-gentiloni-italy"}
{"Title": "Interview with Associated Press White House Correspondent Julie Pace", "Date": "2017-04-21", "Text": "Good.\nDid you see Aya...\nNo, just — you know, I asked the government to let her out. ...\nYou know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.\nMany people, human rights people, are talking about it. It's an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize — I mean, she was in a rough place.\nNo. No deal. He was here. He — I said, \"I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out.\" And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ...\nYeah, it's funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with Merkel.\nChancellor Merkel.\nAnd I guess somebody shouted out, \"Shake her hand, shake her hand,\" you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.\nNo. Because, um, I'm at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I'm at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. ...\nSo it was a great thing to see that happen.\nI think the 100 days is, you know, it's an artificial barrier. It's not very meaningful. I think I've established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I'm here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I've established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they've never seen anything like what's going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ...\nI've developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody's written that. In fact, they said, \"Oh, well, he's not treating them nicely,\" because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, \"Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.\" He'll pay.\nHe's going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it's a different kind of a presidency.\nYeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, \"I'm sorry, we're going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,\" or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ...\nI saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It's actually a little bit more than that, but it's $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, \"I've never seen anything like this in my life.\" We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut — same planes, same everything — was because of me. I mean, because that's what I do.\nNow if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those ... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, \"Could I thank you?\" I said, \"What?\" He said, \"You saved us $100 million.\" Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they. Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that's a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of — it's between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.\nMore. I'm gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it's great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn, she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?\nI have great relationships with Congress. I think we're doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We're going to be applying, I shouldn't tell you this, but we're going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it's — we've worked on it long and hard. And you've got to understand, I've only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I've been here 92 days but I've only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 days, so I've been working on health care for 60 days. ...You know, we're very close. And it's a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.\nSo the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They're great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don't seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don't have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it's fine. But you know there's a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we'll be in great shape on that. It's going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.\nYeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we've done a lot. You have a list of things. I don't have to read it.\nSomebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I'm mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I'll talk to you ...\nBut things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, \"By the way, I'd like you to solve the North Korean problem,\" doesn't work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it's a very exact thing. It's not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?\nBut President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there's a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he's helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, \"By the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you're a currency manipulator.\" It doesn't work that way.\nAnd the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don't get it, in which case they're very stupid people, or they just don't want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, \"He didn't call them a currency manipulator.\" Well, for two reasons. Number One, he's not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it's like generalities, it's not. They have — they've actually — their currency's gone up. So it's a very, very specific formula. And I said, \"How badly have they been,\" ... they said, \"Since you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.\" That's Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that'll work out or maybe it won't. Can you imagine? ...\nNo, because much of the foundation's been laid. Things came up. I'll give you an example. I didn't put Supreme Court judge on the 100 plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.\nI don't know. ...\nThat's the biggest thing I've done.\nWell, I — first of all I think he's a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don't forget, he could be there for 40 years. ... He's a young man. I've always heard that that's the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I've always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I've done one in my first 70 days.\nOur military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. ...\nI'm rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million — look at that, that's a massive amount of money. And I'll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes — Gen. Mattis said, \"I've never seen anything like this,\" because he had to sign the ultimate [unintelligible]... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, \"I've never seen anything like this before, as long as I've been in the military.\" You know, that kind of cutting.\nNow, if I can do that [unintelligible] ... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won't happen.\n[unintelligible] But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. ...\nWell the one thing I would say — and I say this to people — I never realized how big it was. Everything's so [unintelligible] like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to —\nNumber One, there's great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I'm saying to myself, \"You know, this is more than just like, 79 missiles. This is death that's involved,\" because people could have been killed. This is risk that's involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area — you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away — and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you'd normally make. [unintelligible] ... This is involving death and life and so many things. ... So it's far more responsibility. [unintelligible] ....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest — you know, you go down the list.\nWell in business, you don't necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you're talking about health care — you have health care in business but you're trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You're providing health. This is [unintelligible]. Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don't involve heart.\nIn fact, in business you're actually better off without it.\nYou have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. [unintelligible] You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we're going to be doing major tax reform. Here's part of your story, it's going to be a big [unintelligible]. Everybody's saying, \"Oh, he's delaying.\" I'm not delaying anything. I'll tell you the other thing is [unintelligible]. I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That's another thing that really has — I've never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, \"Well the one thing good is now I'll get good press.\" And it got worse. [unintelligible] So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.\nWell I'm going to roll probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we're putting out a massive tax reform — business and for people — we want to do both. We've been working on it [unintelligible]. Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful [unintelligible]. ... We're going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case [unintelligible]. ... And that's a big story, because a lot of people think I'm going to put it out much later.\nOnly in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we've ever had. ...\nI don't know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it — you've been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it's funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I've always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college — but it's a whole different campaign [unintelligible]. The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they're 73 percent down. ... That's a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it's going lower. Now, people aren't coming because they know they're not going to get through, and there isn't crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? [nintelligible] Now, much of that's stopped because they can't get through.\nWell, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I'm seeing. I'm seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.\nOh I'm seeing numbers — $24 billion, I think I'll do it for $10 billion or less. That's not a lot of money relative to what we're talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in — and we'll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall — they're coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can't do it because it's a real wall. That's a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We're becoming a drug culture, there's so much. And most of it's coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.\nI don't want to comment. I just don't know yet. I mean, I have to see what's going on. I really do. But the wall's a very important thing to — not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn't, I mean I'll do things that aren't necessarily popular. ... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.\nMy base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall's getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it's getting built. And it's also getting built for much less money — I hope you get this — than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It's not going to cost anywhere near that.\nI think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it's not going to be anywhere near kind of numbers. And they're using those numbers; they're using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable. And the fact it's going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.\nThey had a quote from me that NATO's obsolete. But they didn't say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn't in government. People don't go around asking about NATO if I'm building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO's obsolete — not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO — NATO is obsolete, and I said, \"And the reason it's obsolete is because of the fact they don't focus on terrorism.\" You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.\n... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete — I said two things — obsolete, and the country's aren't paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn't believe. And then some expert on NATO said, \"You know, Trump is right.\" But I said it was obsolete because they weren't focused on terror. ...\nIt's not fair that we're paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they're supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.\"\nWell, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.\nI think so.\nNo, I have no comment on that, but I think that it'll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what's been going on in France.\nNo. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing. ...\nNo, I am no different than — no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we've done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I'm not going to have it in this country. I'm not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it's already largely, you know — we have tens — we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn't be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It's a big mistake.\nI am not endorsing her and I didn't mention her name.\nI believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.\nYou live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma, he comes up, he says, \"Only because of you am I making this massive investment.\" Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that.\nWhat would you like to know?\nI am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don't even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.\nI am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.\nAbsolutely. If they don't treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.\nIt's a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it's a six-month clause.\nWhen Wikileaks came out ... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, \"Well, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.\" You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn't have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren't able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, \"Wow.\" It was just a figure of speech. I said, \"Well, look at this. It's good reading.\"\nNo, I don't support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn't have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn't even allow the FBI. How about this — they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won't let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn't Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.\nThat's what I heard. I heard it's owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that's what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn't they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It's incredible.\nI am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it's OK with me. I didn't know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it's OK with me.\nAnd the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. ...\nIn terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.\nNo, I don't say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.\nIn terms of what they are doing of all over.\nI don't talk to them about it.\nI mention it, but it's very personal when I talk to them, you know, it's confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don't say that they are different than my opinions, but I'd rather have you ask them that question.\nIt's possible that we won't.\nNo, we aren't looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers ... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he's got some problems, it's a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They've taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that's what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.\nYes. Yes. That's our policy. I am not saying ... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. Kelly, now Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being ... all over the country and nobody's ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that's probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth. ...\nHere is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I'll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy. ...\n[An aide talks about the president's address to Congress.]\nA lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.\nI did. I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success? ... That's another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we've had in the Middle East with the ISIS? When Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years. ... We have had tremendous success, but we don't talk about it. We don't talk about it.\nI don't talk about it. No. And the generals don't talk about it.\nWe have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.\nRemember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.\nRight. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.\nGenerally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations.\nNo, not much.\nWell, they've also accepted my strategy.\nNot many.\nIt could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more. ... This is an important story. I've done a lot. I've done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I'm scheduled ... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ...\nWe had good chemistry. Now I don't know that I think that's going to produce results but you've got a good chance.\nLook, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They're coming into China and they're being turned away. That's never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they've never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There's a great foundation that's built. Great foundation. And I think it's going to produce tremendous results for our country.\nThat's fine.\nYes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn't been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.\nYeah, my White House team. I think Reince has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It's just the registration, there's nothing you can do. So you're losing the two biggest states, that's where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it's very, very hard. Look at Obama's number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were ... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.\nSo she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions ... Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn't 270, it was 306. So there's anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it's not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here's a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes.\nThree Democratic votes. OK. He's an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all ... nothing. He's like a ...\nYeah, I do.\nI think I can to an extent. But there's a, there's a basic hard-line core that you can't break though, OK, that you can't break through. There's a hard-line group you can't break through, you can't. It's sad. You can't. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings. I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.\nThat's what he said. I mean, what can I tell you?\nThere's six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?\nWell he said, you'll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I'll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It's incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it's like he was never in my office. And you can even say that.\nNo I have, it's interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it's the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.\nIt had 9.2 million people. It's the highest they've ever had. On any, on air, Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It's the highest for \"Face the Nation\" or as I call it, \"Deface the Nation.\" It's the highest for \"Deface the Nation\" since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It's a tremendous advantage.\nI have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that's what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you're fake, but — but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It's not that Fox treats me well, it's that Fox is the most accurate.\nI do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it's a terrorism ... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, \"He called it a terrorist attack.\" They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I'm 10-0 for that. I've called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I'm ... Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I'm here and they're not.\nYeah.\nOK. The one thing I've learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don't watch CNN anymore.\nNo. No, I, if I'm passing it, what did I just say [inaudible]?\nWhere? Where?\nNo, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what'd I say, I stopped watching them. But I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC. I don't watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what's going on.\nIn fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch \"Morning Joe.\" I don't watch \"Morning Joe.\" I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it's about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it's such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I've developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don't watch things that are unpleasant. I just don't watch them.\nNo.\nI don't know why it is, but I've developed that ability, and it's happened over the last, over the last year.\nAnd I don't watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don't watch them anymore. A lot of people don't watch them anymore, they're now in third place. But I've created something where people are watching ... but I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't watch MSNBC anymore. I don't watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I'd watch.\nI just don't. And that's taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that's a great, it's a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you're, you don't watch this total negativity. I never thought I'd be able to do that and for me, it's so easy to do now. Just don't watch.\nMaybe it's because I'm here. I don't know.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-associated-press-white-house-correspondent-julie-pace"}
{"Title": "Interview with John Dickerson of CBS News", "Date": "2017-04-30", "Text": "Well, I didn't say, \"Don't test a missile.\" He's going to have to do what he has to do. But he understands we're not going to be very happy. And I will tell you, a man that I've gotten to like and respect, the president of China, President Xi, I believe, has been putting pressure on him also. But so far, perhaps nothing's happened and perhaps it has. This was a small missile. This was not a big missile. This was not a nuclear test, which he was expected to do three days ago. We'll see what happens.\nI would not be happy. If he does a nuclear test, I will not be happy. And I can tell you also, I don't believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either.\nI don't know. I mean, we'll see.\nYou can never be sure of anything, can you? But I developed a very good relationship. I don't think they want to see a destabilized North Korea. I don't think they want to see it. They certainly don't want to see nuclear on -- from their neighbor. They haven't liked it for a long time. But we'll have to see what happens.\nThe relationship I have with China, it's been already acclaimed as being something very special, something very different than we've ever had. But again, you know, we'll find out whether or not President Xi is able to affect change.\nI hope he is.\nWell, I'd rather not discuss it. But perhaps they're just not very good missiles. But eventually, he'll have good missiles.\nI just don't want to discuss it. And I think you know me very well, where you've asked me many times over the last couple of years about military. I said, \"We shouldn't be announcing we're going into Mosul.\" I said, \"We shouldn't be announcing all our moves.\" It is a chess game. I just don't want people to know what my thinking is. So eventually, he will have a better delivery system. And if that happens, we can't allow it to happen.\nI have -- I really, you know, have no comment on him. People are saying, \"Is he sane?\" I have no idea. I can tell you this, and a lot of people don't like when I say it, but he was a young man of 26 or 27 when he took over from his father, when his father died. He's dealing with obviously very tough people, in particular the generals and others.\nAnd at a very young age, he was able to assume power. A lot of people, I'm sure, tried to take that power away, whether it was his uncle or anybody else. And he was able to do it. So obviously, he's a pretty smart cookie. But we have a situation that we just cannot let -- we cannot let what's been going on for a long period of years continue. And frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration. Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration. Should've been taken care of by Clinton.\nI think I can agree with that. I love doing it. I'm, you know, thoroughly enjoying it. It's always a challenge, like life itself is a challenge. But it's something that I really love and I think I've done a very good job at it.\nWell, it's a tough job. But I've had a lot of tough jobs. I've had things that were tougher, although I'll let you know that better at the end of eight years. Perhaps eight years. Hopefully, eight years. But I'll let you know later on. I think we've done very well with foreign policy. I think we've done very, very well with relationships with other leaders.\nI think we're doing great on trade deals. It's set. And I think we're doing well. I mean, our country is being out-traded at every single point. We're losing tremendous amounts of money on trade. And I think actually, I've been very consistent. You know, it's very funny when the fake media goes out, you know, which we call the mainstream media which sometimes, I must say, is you.\nWell, your show. I love your show. I call it Deface the Nation. But, you know, your show is sometimes not exactly correct. But when they talk about currency manipulation, and I did say I would call China, if they were, a currency manipulator, early in my tenure. And then I get there. Number one, they -- as soon as I got elected, they stopped. They're not -- it's not going down anymore, their currency.\nNo.\nNo, not true to the extent that we're talking about. Much more important than that, as to when, but, you know, it did stop. And I was talking about it all during the campaign. And I would say that I was the one that got them to stop. But forget that.\nI think so, during the campaign I talked about.\nNo, they were doing it before. I mean, there was no question. I mean, they were absolute currency manipulators before. But somebody said, \"Oh, you didn't call him a currency manipulator.\" Now, you and I are just talking about how he's working -- I believe that President Xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem, for China also.\nAnd that's North Korea. Can you imagine if I say, \"Hey, by the way, how are you doing with North Korea? Also, we're going to announce that you're a currency manipulator tomorrow.\" So the mainstream media never talks about that. They never say that. And that's, you know, unfortunate. It's just--\n--it's just one of many things, John.\nNo. I think that, frankly, North Korea is maybe more important than trade. Trade is very important. But massive warfare with millions, potentially millions of people being killed? That, as we would say, trumps trade.\nOkay? You understand what I'm saying. And if I can use trade as a method to get China, because I happen to think that China does have reasonably good powers over North Korea. Now, maybe not, you know, ultimate, but pretty good powers. Now, if China can help us with North Korea and can solve that problem--\n--that's worth making not as good a trade deal for the United States, excuse me, right?\nWell, one of the things that I've learned is how dishonest the media is, really. I've done things that are I think very good. I've set great foundations with foreign leaders. We have you know -- NAFTA, as you know, I was going to terminate it, but I got a very nice call from a man I like, the president of Mexico.\nI got a very nice call from Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. And they said please would you rather than terminating NAFTA -- I was all set to do it. In fact, I was going to do it today. I was going to do as we're sitting here. I would've had to delay you. I was going to do it today. I was going to terminate NAFTA. But they called up and they said, \"Would you negotiate?\" And I said, \"Yes, I will negotiate.\"\nNo, no, but the media didn't cover it that way. The media said, oh, I didn't terminate NAFTA.\n\"If I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, I will terminate NAFTA.\" Well, I'll make that statement right now.\nIf I'm not able to renegotiate NAFTA, we will terminate NAFTA.\nOkay.\n--it was one of my disappointments.\nWell, I think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than you'd like them to go.\nJust a system. It's just a very, very bureaucratic system. I think the rules in Congress and in particular the rules in the Senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving. And in many cases, unfair. In many cases, you're forced to make deals that are not the deal you'd make. You'd make a much different kind of a deal.\nYou're forced into situations that you hate to be forced into. I also learned, and this is very sad, because we have a country that we have to take care of. The Democrats have been totally obstructionist. Chuck Schumer has turned out to be a bad leader. He's a bad leader for the country. And the Democrats are extremely obstructionist.\nAll they do is obstruct. All they do is delay. Even our Supreme Court justice, as you know, who I think is going to be outstanding, Justice Gorsuch. I think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that. But, you know, I still have people, I'm waiting for them to be approved. Our chief trade negotiator. We can't get these people through.\nThey are obstructionists. And you know what that's hurting? It's hurting the country.\nExcuse me, the health care bill is going to help my supporters.\nOtherwise, I'm not going to sign it. I'm not going to do it.\nWell, that's what I just said.\nLet me just tell you.\nPre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, \"Pre-existing is not covered.\" Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, \"Has to be.\"\nWe have, we're going to have lower premiums. And before you start there, let me just tell you something. Obamacare is dead. Obamacare right now, all the insurance companies are fleeing. Places like Tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies. They're all going. Obamacare, John, is dead. Okay, because we're being -- we're being compared to Obamacare. Just, so. Obamacare doesn't work--\nOne thing. No, no, it's important. I've got to compare it.\nBut you were saying about Obamacare.\n--the premiums are too high. The deductibles are through the roof, so you never get to use it. But more importantly, it's dead.\nBut that was a long time ago, John.\nTotally fixed.\nHow? We've made many changes to the bill. You know, this bill is--\n--very much different than it was three weeks ago.\nLet me explain. Let me explain it to you.\nThis bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved. And we didn't have a failure on the bill. You know, it was reported like a failure. Now, the one thing I wouldn't have done again is put a timeline. That's why on the second iteration, I didn't put a timeline.\nBut we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We have -- we've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall. We're taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete--\n--nationwide.\nOf course, it's in.\nIt's in the second phase.\nIt's called phase one, phase two. And that's, in effect, second phase, which will get approved, which will quickly get approved.\nBut let me just explain something. There will be such competition. Right now, there's no competition. There will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care.\nThe other thing we're going to have is groups. Groups of people can negotiate. What's going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums. In my opinion, much, much more than people understand.\nNo, there were things in the other bill, the first version, which were not as good.\nBut when I watch some of the news reports, which are so unfair, and they say we don't cover pre-existing conditions, we cover it beautifully.\nI'll tell you who doesn't cover pre-existing conditions. Obamacare. You know why? It's dead.\nIt's not going to be here.\nSure, in one of the fixes. And they're changing it--\n--and changing.\nOf course.\nJohn, this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks. Now, we really have a good bill. I think they could have voted on Friday. I said, \"Just relax. Don't worry about this phony 100 day thing. Just relax. Take it easy. Take your time. Get the good vote and make it perfect.\"\nMost importantly, we're going to drive down premiums. We're going to drive down deductibles because right now, deductibles are so high, you never -- unless you're going to die a long, hard death, you never can get to use your health care--\n--because the deductibles are so high.\n--going to create pools.\nAnd pools are going to take care of the pre-existing.\n--are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states.\nLook, because if you hurt your knee, honestly, I'd rather have the federal government focused on North Korea, focused on other things, than your knee, okay? Or than your back, as important as your back is. I would much rather see the federal government focused on other things--\n--bigger things. Now, the state is going to be in a much better position to take care, because it's smaller.\n--we actually have, well, forget about unaffordable. What's unaffordable is Obamacare, John.\nWe actually have -- we actually have a clause that guarantees.\n--that guarantees.\nGo ahead.\nWell, not only growth. It's going to be made up by better trade deals. It's going to be made up--\n--by many different, reciprocal tax. As an example, we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country, they charge us 100% tax. If they make the same product and send it to us, we charge them nothing. You think that's smart? It's not.\nWe're going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries. But I view that more in trade. We're also going to fix all of our trade deals. We're going to have a very wealthy country again.\nAlways.\nYou're not going to have to do it.\nYou're not going to have to do it. I'm just telling you we are--\nI would much prefer them not to do that, that's right.\nOkay, then let me more clear. I'm not going to touch it, because I said it. Now, waste, fraud and abuse, I'm going to touch. If there's something in Medicare that's been abused, I will touch that. There are certain things, as you know, that have been absolutely abused. There are certain provisions in Medicare that are horrible and abusive and there's been terrible things happening. So that kind of stuff, I will absolutely touch.\nBut the concept of Medicare, I'm not touching.\nWaste, fraud and abuse.\nAnd if there are things within Medicare that are being abused, I will touch that also.\nThat's right. That's what it is. But here's what we do. We're going to grow. The numbers just came out for Obama's last year. 1.6 GDP. That means nothing. That's, like, 1% GDP. So I have gotten to know as you know, I really get along with a lot of other countries. So I talk to the heads of countries. \"How are you doing?\" \"Not well, not well.\" \"Why?\" \"GDP is 8%. GDP is 9%. We are doing poorly.\" GDP -- Our GDP is, like, 1%.\nWell, I never spoke to him about it. Honestly, he's never asked me about it. I said, number one, I'm under audit. Right now, I'm under audit. After the audit is complete. It's a routine audit, but I have a very big tax return. You've seen the pictures. My tax return is probably higher than that from the floor. When you look at other people's tax return, even other wealthy people, their tax return is this big. My tax return is this high.\n--audit. And I think it's a very unfair thing because I have been under audit almost, like, since I became famous, okay?\nNot just political. I mean, I have been under audit, I'll bet you 12 or 13 or 14 years in a row. Now, I have friends that are wealthy people.\nThey've never been audited.\nAnd I think it's very unfair.\nIt could happen soon. I don't know. I mean, I think--\n--it's pretty routine, to be honest with you. But then I'll make a decision.\nOh, I don't know who did that. I mean, I don't care who did that. These are the people, you know, the great obstructionists.\nLook where they are. Look where the Democrats have ended up. Hey, John, they had everything going. Now they don't have the presidency, they don't have the House, they don't have the Senate, and Schumer's going around making a fool out of himself.\nThe concept of Russia with respect to us is a total phony story.\nOf course, it's a total phony story. In fact, I just heard where General Flynn got his clearance from the Obama administration.\nExcuse me. I didn't realize this, when he went to Russia, it was 2015 and he was on the Obama clearance. When General Flynn came to us, as you now know, he already had the highest clearance you can have. I think the same clearance as the president of the United States would have. He had this really high clearance. And, by the way, they're so devastated because this only came up two days ago.\nWhy wasn't this reported months ago?\n--by this news, because you know what? That kills them. That's the end of that subject.\nThat, I don't know. I don't know.\nWell, I have a problem. You have Podesta, who, by the way, I understand has a company with his brother in Russia. Hillary's husband makes speeches in Russia. Hillary did a uranium deal with Russia. Nobody ever talks about that. But I don't know--\n--because the F.B.I. was not allowed by Podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check. That's number one.\nNumber two, knowing something about hacking, if you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacking. With that being said, I'll go along with Russia. Could've been China, could've been a lot of different groups.\nNo. We have to find out what happened. I'd love to find out what happened.\nI can tell you one thing. Had nothing to do with us. Had nothing to do with this, and everyone knows it. And by the way, even my enemies on your show said, \"We haven't found anything that the Trump campaign did wrong.\"\nDo you agree with that?\nI'm okay with it.\nHonestly, John, I'm okay. But why didn't Podesta and the Democrats, why didn't they allow the F.B.I. to eject the server? They hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about, to go and check their server and give the information. So they were hacked. Why didn't they -- the Democrats allow the F.B.I.? They told the F.B.I., \"We are not going to allow you to do it.\" Why did they do that? Why did they do that, John? Why wouldn't they let the F.B.I. go in and check? And by the way, why didn't the F.B.I. complain about it?\nMr. President, I think we're going to have to end it there.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-john-dickerson-cbs-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon of Colombia", "Date": "2017-05-18", "Text": "Thank you very much. It is a great pleasure to welcome President Santos to the White House. Colombia is one of our closest allies in the hemisphere, and today we reaffirm partnership between our two great nations.\nPresident Santos and I had a very productive meeting, and we will continue to work very closely together to bring peace, safety, and prosperity to the hemisphere. Perhaps no area is really more important in terms of cooperation than our joint effort to end the terrible drug crimes that plague both of our countries.\nRecently, we have seen an alarmed—and I mean really a very highly alarmed and alarming trend. Last year, Colombia coca cultivation and cocaine production reached a record high, which, hopefully, will be remedied very quickly by the President. We must confront this dangerous threat to our societies together.\nToday I affirmed the United States willingness to assist Colombia's strategy to target and eliminate drug trafficking networks, illicit financings, coca cultivation, and cocaine production, of which there is far too much. The drug epidemic is poisoning too many American lives, and we're going to stop it many different ways. One of them will be the wall.\nMy administration is committed to keeping drugs and gangs from pouring into our country. Already, border crossings are down more than 73 percent. Secretary Kelly is with us; he's done a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And in short, we have a tremendous group of people working with us in terms of ICE, the ICE patrol and the Border Patrol agents. They've done a fantastic job, and I'd like you to give them my highest compliments, Mr. Secretary.\nAnd MS-13, likewise—a horrible, horrible, large group of gangs that have been let into our country over a fairly short period of time—are being decimated by the Border Patrol, by ICE, and by our incredible local police forces. And they are getting out of our country or, in some cases, going directly into prisons throughout our country. But they've literally taken over towns and cities of the United States. They will be gone very quickly.\nI look forward to working with President Santos as we target drug trafficking. Both the United States and Colombia have strong law enforcement and security relationship. We've had it and especially over the last fairly short period of time. Together, we will continue to fight the criminal networks responsible for the deadly drug trade that our people have a really strong commitment to getting rid of, because they want a much brighter future.\nPresident Santos and I also discussed the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and it is really in a very bad state, as you see and as we all see through the media. The stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere, and America stands with all of the people in our great hemisphere yearning to be free. We will be working with Colombia and other countries on the Venezuelan problem. It is a very, very horrible problem. And from a humanitarian standpoint, it is like nothing we've seen in quite a long time. The United States and Colombia are also strong economic partners, and we will continue to pursue trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. The nations' common goals of protecting our citizens, expanding opportunity, and confronting the drug crisis will improve the lives of our people and many throughout the region.\nSo many people are being so horribly affected by what's going on in terms of violence and in terms of drugs, and we're going to take care of the situation. And we've both agreed to take care of it strongly and quickly.\nPresident Santos, it was an honor to meet with you and your entire group of representatives, very talented people indeed, who have been working with us and my representatives. And I look forward to many more productive meetings, such as the one we just had. I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House, being our guest. And I'd like to congratulate you on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. That's a very great achievement. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Does anybody have any questions? [Laughter] I'm shocked.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], go ahead.\nThank you.\nWell, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself—and the Russians, zero.\nI think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things. So I can tell you that we want to bring this great country of ours together, Jon. And I will also say very strongly, we've had tremendous success. You look at our job numbers, you look at what's going on at the border, as we discussed before; if you look at what will be happening—you're going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation. The numbers are staggering, how successful they've been, the military has been. Tomorrow, as you know, I'm going to Saudi Arabia, going to Israel. I'm going to Rome. And we have the G-7. We have a lot of great things going on.\nSo I hate to see anything that divides. I'm fine with whatever people want to do, but we have to get back to running this country really, really well. We've made tremendous progress in the last hundred-some-odd days. Tremendous progress. And you see job numbers; you see all of the production that's starting. Plants starting to open again. Haven't been open in years. I'm very proud of it. That's what I want to be focused on. Because, believe me, there's no collusion. Russia is fine. But whether it's Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America.\nSo thank you very much.\nWell, that's true. Venezuela is a very, very serious problem. We haven't really seen a problem like that, I would say, Mr. President, in decades, in terms of the kind of violence that we're witnessing. The President was telling me—and I knew—that Venezuela was a very, very wealthy country, just about the wealthiest in your neck of the woods, and had tremendous strengths in so many different ways. And now it's poverty stricken. People don't have enough to eat. People have no food. There's great violence. And we will do whatever is necessary—and we'll work together to do whatever is necessary—to help with fixing that. And I'm really talking on a humanitarian level.\nWhen you look at the oil reserves that they have, when you look at the potential wealth that Venezuela has, you sort of have to wonder, why is that happening? How is that possible? But it's been unbelievably poorly run for a long period of time. And hopefully, that will change, and they can use those assets for the good and to take care of their people. Because right now what's happening is really a disgrace to humanity.\nAnd, Jon, I think you also had a question for the President, if you'd like to.\nAnd that was a long and very diplomatic answer to your question. [Laughter] I will say it a little bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel. They work. Believe me, they work. And we have no choice.\nPeter Baker [New York Times]. Yes.\nNo. No. Next question. [Laughter]\nInvestigation of Russia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr./Health Care Reform/Job Creation and Growth\nI think it's totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. And again, we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We've done a fantastic job. We have a tremendous group of people. Millions and millions of people out there that are looking at what you had just said and said, \"What are they doing?\"\nDirector Comey was very unpopular with most people. I actually thought when I made that decision—and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. But when I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision, because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side—not only the Republican side—that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.\nThen, he had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance, so poor, in fact, that I believe—and you'd have to ask him, because I don't like to speak for other people—but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.\nAnd then, on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made. And I thought that was something that was terrible.\nWe need a great Director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It's special. All over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special. The FBI has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say—directly or indirectly—with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.\nWe're going to have a Director who is going to be outstanding. I'll be announcing that director very soon, and I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very thrilled.\nAnd just in concluding, we look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that when we go for the jobs, we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we've been pushing so hard and so successfully, including health care—because Obamacare is collapsing. It's dead; it's gone. There's nothing to compare anything to because we don't have health care in this country. You just look at what's happening. Aetna just pulled out. Other insurance companies are pulling out. We don't have health care. Obamacare is a fallacy. It's gone. We need health care. We need to cut taxes. We're going to cut taxes. Forget what I want; it will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our Nation. And that's what I want. It's going to bring back companies. It's going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies to countries that are not so far from you, Mr. President—they're very close to you, actually—and to many other places throughout the world. We're going to change that. We're going to have expansion.\nWe already do. You look at what's happening with Ford and with General Motors in Michigan and Ohio. You look at the tremendous number of jobs that are being announced in so many different fields. That's what I'm proud of, and that's what we want to focus our energy on.\nThe other is something I can only tell you: There was no collusion. And everybody—even my enemies have said, there is no collusion.\nSo we want to get back and keep on the track that we're on. Because the track that we're on is record setting, and that's what we want to do, is we want to break very positive records.\nThank you. You could ask a question.\nWell, it's been a long process, and it's been a great thing to watch in the sense that the President did a fantastic job. That's not easy after so many years of war. So I'm very, very proud to get to know you, and I really congratulate you. There's nothing tougher than peace, and we want to make peace all over the world. And you are really a great example of somebody that started it.\nI mean, FARC is—that was a long, tough situation, as you know very well, coming from the country. But I think the President has done a magnificent job. Not easy. But he's done a magnificent job.\n[President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you, thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-juan-manuel-santos-calderon-colombia-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Klaus Iohannis of Romania", "Date": "2017-06-09", "Text": "Thank you very much. President Iohannis, thank you for being here. It's an honor to welcome such a good friend of America to the White House.\nAs you know, the people of Romania and America share much in common: a love of freedom, proud cultures, rich traditions, and a vast and storied landscape to call home. The relationship between our two countries stretches back well over a century. But today we especially reaffirm and celebrate our strategic partnership that began more than 20 years ago. That partnership covers many dimensions, including economic, military, and cultural ties. And today we are making those ties even stronger.\nThank you.\nDave Boyer, Washington Times, please. Dave. Come on, Dave. Got to get going here, Dave. [Laughter]\nThat's all right, Dave.\nFormer Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.'s Testimony Before the Senate Intelligence Committee/2016 Presidential Election\nYes. Well, I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future. But in the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He's a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country: jobs; trade deficits, we want them to disappear fast; North Korea, a big problem; Middle East, a big problem. So that's what I am focused on. That's what I have been focused on.\nBut yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction. We are doing really well. That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn't have lost, because it's almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole East Coast, and you have to win everything as a Republican. And that's just what we did.\nSo it was a—just an excuse. But we were very, very happy. And frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren't true.\nThank you very much.\nDo you have a question?\nOne-hundred percent correct. And you know, one of the things I was referring to during that speech was the fact that, yes, they haven't paid what they should be paying now, but for many years, they haven't been paying. So I said, do we ever go back and say, how about paying the money from many, many years passed?\nNow, I know no President has ever asked that question. But I do. And we're going to make NATO very strong. We need the money to make it strong. You can't just do what we've been doing in the past. So I did say, yes, you haven't paid this year, but what about the past years, the many past years where you haven't paid? Perhaps you should pay some or all of that money back.\nYou have a question?\n[At this point, President Iohannis called on a reporter.]\nNorth Atlantic Treaty OrganizationQ.Thank you. I have a question for President Trump. On the matter of security, sir, you—many of the countries on the eastern flank of NATO, including Romania, see Russia as a threat to the security and the peace in the region. Do you share this vision? And do you think that United States should act under article 5 if any of these countries will be under military aggression?\nThank you very much.\nWell, I'm committing the United States, and have committed, but I'm committing the United States to article 5. And certainly, we are there to protect. And that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force. But yes, absolutely, I'd be committed to article 5.\n[President Iohannis called on another reporter.]\nWe didn't discuss it. But there would be certainly—it would be something we will discuss.\nGood.\nOh, look at those hands up there, President. Do you have this in Romania too? I don't know. [Laughter] Oh boy!\nIf I could only sell that. If I could only sell it.\nWho would like to ask—should I take one of the killer networks that treat me so badly as fake news? Should I do that? Huh?\nGo ahead, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Be fair, Jon.\nRemember how nice you used to be before I ran? Such a nice man.\nFormer Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.'s Testimony Before the Senate Intelligence Committee/Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/The President's Past Conversations With Former Director ComeyQ.Always fair. Mr. President, I want to get back to James Comey's testimony. You suggested he didn't tell the truth in everything he said. He did say, under oath, that you told him to let the Flynn—you said you hoped the Flynn investigation you could let go—he could let——\nI didn't say that.\nWell, I didn't say that. I mean, I will tell you I didn't say that.\nAnd there would be nothing wrong if I did say it, according to everybody that I've read today. But I did not say that.\nNo, he did not.\nOne-hundred percent. I didn't say under oath—I hardly know the man. I'm not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn't make sense. No, I didn't say that, and I didn't say the other.\nI would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, Jon.\nI'm not hinting anything. I'll tell you about it over a very short period of time.\n[Other reporters began asking questions along with Mr. Karl.]\nOkay? Do you have a question here?\nOver a fairly short period of time.\nOh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer. Don't worry. [Laughter]\nJon, do you have a question for the President?\nWell, we support very strongly Romania. And therefore, obviously, we do support that fight on anticorruption. We will always support that. And we support your President. We think he's done an outstanding job. Very popular, very solid, working very hard. We know everything that's going on. And, yes—and he's going to win that fight. He's going to win that battle. But he has our support.\nWell, you do. But I can tell you that there are many American investors right now going to Romania and investing. In fact, I was given a chart just before our meeting, and we have people going over to Romania and investing, and they weren't doing that a number of years ago. So that shows very, very big progress. And there really are a lot of congratulations in store. But a lot of people are investing from our country to yours.\nAnd people love—from Romania—the United States. And they come here a lot, and we're very proud of them.\nThank you all very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-klaus-iohannis-romania"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, France", "Date": "2017-07-13", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, President Macron. And Melania and I are thrilled to join you and Mrs. Macron. This is a wonderful national celebration, and we look very much forward to it. It will be spectacular tomorrow: Bastille Day.\nWe're honored to be here in your beautiful country—and it certainly is a beautiful country—with its proud history and its magnificent people. And thank you for the tour of some of the most incredible buildings anywhere in the world. I was very, very—a very beautiful thing to see. Thank you.\nWhen the French people rose up and stormed the Bastille, it changed the course of human history. Our two nations are forever joined together by the spirit of revolution and the fight for freedom. France is America's first and oldest ally. A lot of people don't know that. Ever since General Lafayette joined the American fight for independence, our fates and fortunes have been tied unequivocally together. It was a long time ago, but we are together, and I think together, perhaps, more so than ever. The relationship is very good.\nThis visit also commemorates another milestone. One century ago, the United States entered World War I. And when the President called me, he had mentioned that fact—a hundred years ago—that was—I said, Mr. President, I will be there. That's a big, important date. One hundred years.\nWe remember the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives in that valiant and very difficult struggle. We also pay tribute to the heroic deeds of the French troops whose courage at the Battle of Marne and countless other battles will never be forgotten by us. More than 1 million French soldiers laid down their lives in defense of liberty. Their sacrifice is an eternal tribute to France and to freedom. French and American patriots have fought together, bled together, and died together in the fight for our countries and our civilizations.\nToday, we face new threats from rogue regimes like North Korea, Iran, and Syria and the governments that finance and support them. We also face grave threats from terrorist organizations that wage war on innocent lives. Tomorrow will mark 1 year since a joyous Bastille Day celebration in Nice turned into a massacre. We all remember that, how horrible that was. We mourn the 86 lives that were stolen, and we pray for their loved ones. We also renew our resolve to stand united against these enemies of humanity and to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and ideological support.\nToday President Macron and myself discussed how we can strengthen our vital security partnerships. We just had a meeting with our generals and our representatives, and it went very well. France has excellent counterterrorism capabilities. The French troops are serving bravely in places like Mali to defeat these forces of murder and destruction. The United States and our allies strengthen our commitments to defeat terrorism.\nWe're also making tremendous progress. Earlier this week, with the strong support of the United States and the Global Coalition, Iraq forces liberated the city of Mosul from ISIS control. Now we must work with the Government of Iraq and our partners and allies in the region to consolidate the gains and ensure that the victory stays a victory, unlike the last time.\nLast week, the G-20 leaders also reaffirmed the right to sovereign nations to control their borders. We must be strong from within to defend ourselves from threats from the outside. The nations of the West also face domestic challenges of our own creation, including vast government bureaucracy that saps the strength from our economies and from our societies.\nFor this reason, I applaud President Macron on his courageous call for that \"less bureaucracy.\" It's a good chant: \"Less bureaucracy.\" We can use it too. [Laughter] And a Europe that protects its citizens. We did not become great through regulation—and in the United States, Mr. President, we also have cut regulations at a level that we've never seen before, so we're very proud of that, over the last 6 months—but by allowing our people to follow their dreams. That's what it's all about. To achieve these dreams, however, we must also confront unfair trade practices that hurt our workers and pursue trade deals that are reciprocal and fair.\nBoth President Macron and I understand our responsibility to prioritize the interests of our countries and, at the same time, to be respectful of the world in which we live. We live in a very complex world. We have to respect it. The United States remains committed to being a leader in environmental protection while we advance energy security and economic growth. The friendship between our two nations—and ourselves, I might add—is unbreakable. Our occasional disagreements are nothing compared to the immortal bonds of culture, destiny, and liberty that unite us. So strongly unite us also. As long as we have pride in who we are, where we've come from, how we got here, and what we've achieved as free and democratic nations, then there is nothing we cannot accomplish together.\nFrance helped us secure our independence. A lot of people forget. In the American Revolution, thousands of French soldiers fought alongside American troops so that, as Lafayette said, liberty would have a country. Ever since then, courageous heroes from both nations have fought for the same noble values and the same righteous cause.\nTomorrow the French Tricolor will once again wave proudly alongside the American Stars and Stripes. Our brave soldiers will march side by side, and we will all be inspired to protect and cherish the birthright of freedom that our ancestors won for us with their sweat and with their blood.\nPresident Macron, thank you for inviting Melania and myself to this historic celebration. And to you and your spectacular country: May God bless France, and may God bless America.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nHe's getting first question, President?\n[The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nI think that I can reiterate. We have a very good relationship, a good friendship. And we look forward to dinner tonight at the Eiffel Tower. That will be something special. And yes, I mean, something could happen with respect to the Paris accord. We'll see what happens. But we will talk about that over the coming period of time. And if it happens, that will be wonderful. And if it doesn't, that will be okay too. But we'll see what happens.\nBut we did discuss many things today, including the cease-fire in Syria. And we discussed the Ukraine. We discussed a lot of different topics. We briefly hit on the Paris accord. And we'll see what happens, okay?\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation/Donald J. Trump, Jr./2016 Presidential Election\nWell, I'll start off by saying, first of all, I believe that we will have a great FBI Director. I think he's doing really well, and we're very proud of that choice. I think I've done a great service to the country by choosing him. He will make us all proud, and I think someday we'll see that, and, hopefully, someday soon. So we're very proud of him.\nAs far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast. Two of the people in the room, they—I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused on the meeting. I do think this: I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research or even research into your opponent. I've had many people—I have only been in politics for 2 years—but I've had many people call up, \"Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person, or frankly, Hillary.\" That's very standard in politics. Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information.\nIn the case of Don, he listened. I guess they talked about, as I see it, they talked about adoption and some things. Adoption wasn't even a part of the campaign. But nothing happened from the meeting. Zero happened from the meeting. And honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that really a lot of people would do.\nNow, the lawyer that went to the meeting, I see that she was in the Halls of Congress also. Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. Now, maybe that's wrong. I just heard that a little while ago. But I was a little surprised to hear that. So she was here because of Lynch.\nSo, again, I have a son who's a great young man. He's a fine person. He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. It lasted for a very short period, and nothing came of the meeting. And I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken.\nWhat a good answer that was. [Laughter]\n[President Macron continued in English as follows.]\nOne of the great things that came out of that meeting, by the way—even though it's not part of the question—was the fact that we got a cease-fire that now has lasted for, I guess, Mr. President, almost 5 days. And while 5 days doesn't sound like a long period of time, in terms of a cease-fire in Syria, that's a very long period of time. And that was a result of having communication with a country. So during that 5-year—5-day period, a lot of lives have been saved. A lot of people were not killed. No shots have been fired in a very, very dangerous part of the world, and this is one of the most dangerous parts of Syria itself.\nSo by having some communication and dialogue, we were able to have this cease-fire, and it's going to go on for a while. And frankly, we're working on a second cease-fire in a very rough part of Syria. And if we get that and a few more, all of a sudden, you're going to have no bullets being fired in Syria. And that would be a wonderful thing.\nYou'd better let me answer that one first. That's a beauty. [Laughter] He's the one that asked the question. That wasn't even one of my picks.\nYou know what, it's going to be just fine, because you have a great President. You have somebody that's going to run this country right. And I would be willing to bet because I think this is one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and you have a great leader now. You have a great President; you have a tough President. He's not going to be easy on people that are breaking the laws and people that show this tremendous violence.\nSo I really have a feeling that you're going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris, and I'm coming back. [Laughter] You'd better do a good job, please. [Laughter] Otherwise, you're going to make me look very bad.\n[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]\nThank you.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.\nThank you.President Macron.Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-paris-france"}
{"Title": "Interview with Peter Baker of The New York Times", "Date": "2017-07-19", "Text": "Hi fellas, how you doing?\nIt was good. We are very close. It's a tough — you know, health care. Look, Hillary Clinton worked eight years in the White House with her husband as president and having majorities and couldn't get it done. Smart people, tough people — couldn't get it done. Obama worked so hard. They had 60 in the Senate. They had big majorities and had the White House. I mean, ended up giving away the state of Nebraska. They owned the state of Nebraska. Right. Gave it away. Their best senator did one of the greatest deals in the history of politics. What happened to him?\nBut I think we are going to do O.K. I think we are going to see. I mean, one of my ideas was repeal. But I certainly rather would get repeal and replace, because the next last thing I want to do is start working tomorrow morning on replace. And it is time. It is tough. It's a very narrow path, winding this way. You think you have it, and then you lose four on the other side because you gave. It is a brutal process. And it was for Democrats, in all fairness.\nI mean, you think of Hillary Clinton, and you look, she went eight years — very capable — went eight years as the first lady, and could not get health care. So this is not an easy crack. The one thing I'll say about myself, so, Obama was in there for eight years and got Obamacare. Hillary Clinton was in there eight years and they never got Hillarycare, whatever they called it at the time. I am not in here six months, and they'll say, \"Trump hasn't fulfilled his agenda.\" I say to myself, wait a minute, I'm only here a very short period of time compared to Obama. How long did it take to get Obamacare?\nSo he was there for more than a year.\nAnd I'm here less than six months, so, ah, you know. Something to think about.\nWell, it was a tough one. That was a very tough one.\nNothing changes. Nothing changes. Once you get something for pre-existing conditions, etc., etc. Once you get something, it's awfully tough to take it away.\nBut what it does, Maggie, it means it gets tougher and tougher. As they get something, it gets tougher. Because politically, you can't give it away. So pre-existing conditions are a tough deal. Because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance, you're 21 years old, you start working and you're paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you're 70, you get a nice plan. Here's something where you walk up and say, \"I want my insurance.\" It's a very tough deal, but it is something that we're doing a good job of.\nYes, yes. [garbled]\nSo I told them today, I don't want to do that. I want to either get it done or not get it done. If we don't get it done, we are going to watch Obamacare go down the tubes, and we'll blame the Democrats. And at some point, they are going to come and say, \"You've got to help us.\"\nI think so. We had a great meeting. Was I late?\nIt was a great meeting. We had 51 show up, other than John.\nThat's a lot. Normally when they call for a meeting, you have like 20.\nAh, 49. It was actually 48, but John McCain was there. But I guess we had 51 today, so that counts. That shows the spirit.\nWell, they are all key. The problem is we have 52 votes. Don't forget, you look at Obama, he had 60. That's a big difference. So, we have 52 votes. Now, I guess we lose Susan Collins. I guess we lose Rand Paul. Then we can't lose any votes. That is a very tough standard. Statistically, you want to bet on that all day long. With that being said, I think we had a great meeting. I think we had a great meeting.\nWell, I say, let's not vote on repeal. Let's just vote on this. So first, they vote on the vote. And that happens sometime Friday?\nOr Monday? Monday. And then they'll vote on this, and we'll see. We have some meetings scheduled today. I think we have six people who are really sort of O.K. They are all good people. We don't have bad people. I know the bad people. Believe me, do I know bad people.\nAnd we have a very good group of people, and I think they want to get there. So we'll see what happens. But it's tough.\nI like him. I mean, he's good. He's good. It's been a tough process for him.\nYeah. It's been a tough process for him. This health care is a tough deal. I said it from the beginning. No. 1, you know, a lot of the papers were saying — actually, these guys couldn't believe it, how much I know about it. I know a lot about health care. [garbled] This is a very tough time for him, in a sense, because of the importance. And I believe we get there.\nThis is a very tough time for them, in a sense, because of the importance. And I believe that it's [garbled], that makes it a lot easier. It's a mess. One of the things you get out of this, you get major tax cuts, and reform. And if you add what the people are going to save in the middle income brackets, if you add that to what they're saving with health care, this is like a windfall for the country, for the people. So, I don't know, I thought it was a great meeting. I bet the number's — I bet the real number's four. But let's say six or eight. And everyone's [garbled], so statistically, that's a little dangerous, right?\nI hope we don't have any grandstanders. I don't think we do.\nI think it will be pretty bad for them if they did. I don't think we have any — I think it would be very bad for — I think this is something the people want. They've been promised it.\nI have had the best reviews on foreign land. So I go to Poland and make a speech. Enemies of mine in the media, enemies of mine are saying it was the greatest speech ever made on foreign soil by a president. I'm saying, man, they cover [garbled]. You saw the reviews I got on that speech. Poland was beautiful and wonderful, and the reception was incredible.\nAnd then, went to France the following week, because it was the 100th year. [inaudible] The Paris Accord — I wasn't going to get along with France for a little while, because people forget, because it is a very unfair agreement to us. China doesn't get [garbled] until 2030. Russia goes back to 1994 as a standard — a much, much lower standard. India has things that are [garbled]. I want to do the same thing as everyone else. We can't do that? We can't do that? That's O.K. Let me get out. Frankly, the people that like me, love that I got out.\nAfter that, it was fairly surprising. He [President Emmanuel Macron of France] called me and said, \"I'd love to have you there and honor you in France,\" having to do with Bastille Day. Plus, it's the 100th year of the First World War. That's big. And I said yes. I mean, I have a great relationship with him. He's a great guy.\nHe's a great guy. Smart. Strong. Loves holding my hand.\nPeople don't realize he loves holding my hand. And that's good, as far as that goes.\nI mean, really. He's a very good person. And a tough guy, but look, he has to be. I think he is going to be a terrific president of France. But he does love holding my hand.\nAt that note, the cameras are gone. I was standing there with him, with probably hundreds of thousands of people.\nAnd it was one of the most beautiful parades I have ever seen. And in fact, we should do one one day down Pennsylvania Ave.\nI've always thought of that.\nI've always thought of that. I've thought of it long before.\nBut the Bastille Day parade was — now that was a super-duper — O.K. I mean, that was very much more than normal. They must have had 200 planes over our heads. Normally you have the planes and that's it, like the Super Bowl parade. And everyone goes crazy, and that's it. That happened for — and you know what else that was nice? It was limited. You know, it was two hours, and the parade ended. It didn't go a whole day. They didn't go crazy. You don't want to leave, but you have to. Or you want to leave, really.\nThese things are going on all day. It was a two-hour parade. They had so many different zones. Maybe 100,000 different uniforms, different divisions, different bands. Then we had the retired, the older, the ones who were badly injured. The whole thing, it was an incredible thing.\nAnd you are looking at the Arc [de Triomphe]. So we are standing in the most beautiful buildings, and we are looking down the road, and like three miles in, and then you had the Arc. And then you have these soldiers. Everyone was so proud. Honestly, it was a beautiful thing. I was glad I did it.\nPeople were surprised because I'd just come back from Hamburg. So I was back for three days, and then I had to go out again. But when he [Mr. Macron] invited me, he and I have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with Merkel [Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany]. Do you know what happened with Merkel? So I am sitting in the chair. We'd been sitting there for two hours. So it's not like, \"Nice to see ya.\" So the press comes in. So I guess someone screamed out, \"Shake her hand, shake her hand!\" I didn't even hear. So I didn't shake her hand, because I'd been with her for so long. I'd been with her for a long period of time. So I didn't shake her — the next day, \"Trump refused to shake…\" [garbled]\nShe actually called me, and she said, um, \"You know, I think we get along very well.\" I said we do, we really do. I said, \"You gotta put more money into NATO,\" No. 1. And No. 2 is like, our trade imbalance is ridiculous. You know, it's a money machine.\nIt's been a long time. Nothing changes. Wait till you see what we're going to do on trade.\nMuch more interesting than anybody would understand.\nAs to Britain?\nAh, they've asked me. What was interesting — so, when Macron asked, I said: \"Do you think it's a good thing for me to go to Paris? I just ended the Paris Accord last week. Is this a good thing?\" He said, \"They love you in France.\" I said, \"O.K., I just don't want to hurt you.\"\nWe had dinner at the Eiffel Tower, and the bottom of the Eiffel Tower looked like they could have never had a bigger celebration ever in the history of the Eiffel Tower. I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people, 'cause they heard we were having dinner.\nYeah. It was beautiful. We toured the museum, we went to Napoleon's tomb …\nWell, Napoleon finished a little bit bad. But I asked that. So I asked the president, so what about Napoleon? He said: \"No, no, no. What he did was incredible. He designed Paris.\" [garbled] The street grid, the way they work, you know, the spokes. He did so many things even beyond. And his one problem is he didn't go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death. How many times has Russia been saved by the weather? [garbled]\nSame thing happened to Hitler. Not for that reason, though. Hitler wanted to consolidate. He was all set to walk in. But he wanted to consolidate, and it went and dropped to 35 degrees below zero, and that was the end of that army.\nBut the Russians have great fighters in the cold. They use the cold to their advantage. I mean, they've won five wars where the armies that went against them froze to death. [crosstalk] It's pretty amazing.\nSo, we're having a good time. The economy is doing great.\nThey're going to really go up if we do what we're doing. I mean, cut regulations tremendously. Sometimes — you know, one thing they hadn't thought about at The Times, where they said I didn't really cut regulations as much. I heard that because I said — it could have been a little slip-up in terms of what I said — I meant, for the time in office, five months and couple of weeks, I think I've done more than anyone else. They may have taken it as more than anyone else, period.\nBut I'm talking about for my time. I heard that Harry Truman was first, and then we beat him. These are approved by Congress. These are not just executive orders. On the executive orders, we cut regulations tremendously. By the way, I want regulations, but, you know, some of the — you have to get nine different regulations, and you could never do anything. I've given the farmers back their farms. I've given the builders back their land to build houses and to build other things.\nThe energy stuff is going really well. We're going to be an exporter — we already are an exporter of energy. We're doing well. I mean, the banks, you look at rules and regulations, you look at Dodd-Frank, Dodd-Frank is going to be, you know, modified, and again, I want rules and regulations. But you don't want to choke, right? People can't get loans to buy a pizza parlor, to buy a — you know, I saw out on the trail — people say, Mr. Trump, we've dealt with banks, my own bank, and they can't loan me anymore. I've never had a bad day with a bank. You know? So we'll put — yeah, because of statutory [garbled], they can't loan to that kind of a business. And they're good businesses to loan to. So I think we've — I think we're set to really go [garbled].\nSo, that dinner was a very long time planned dinner. And what it was was an evening at the opera. It was a final night goodbye from Germany and from Chancellor Merkel. It was her dinner. It was, you know, everybody knew about it. It was well-known.\nSo when we got there, it was with spouses, and when we got there, there were a thousand media. You guys know, were you guys there?\nSo, it was tremendous media. And we took a picture of everybody, the wives and the leaders, and then the leaders, and, you know, numerous pictures outside on the river. Then everybody walked in to see the opera. Then the opera ended. Then we walked into a big room where they had dinner for not only the leaders — Lagarde [Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund] was there, who I think is terrific, and various others. You had the E.U. people there, people other than just the leaders, but quite a few people. I would say you have 20 times two, so you had 40, and then you probably had another 10 or 15 people, you had Christine Lagarde, you had some others also.\nSo, I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe [Shinzo Abe of Japan], who I think is a terrific guy, and she's a terrific woman, but doesn't speak English.\nLike, not \"hello.\"\nSo the dinner was probably an hour and 45 minutes.\nYou had an opera, and then you had a cocktail party for the people at the opera, and then you had the leaders with the spouses, and other leaders in Europe and maybe other places, go in. We sat at this really long table, which held, has to be at least 60, 65 people with room. O.K., it's a very big table, big room. But there was nothing secretive about it.\nIt was like, that's where we're going. And I think it even said on the list, at the request of the German chancellor and Germany, it's going to be the opera, it's going to be cocktails, it's going to be dinner. I think the crowd thinned out for the dinner — you know, it was the leaders, primarily. But the leaders and Lagarde. And [inaudible].\nHow Times reporters cover politics. Times journalists may vote, but they are not allowed to endorse or campaign for candidates or political causes. That includes participating in rallies and donating money to a candidate or cause.\nYes. She was sitting next to Putin.\nNo. She speaks other languages.\nShe was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that's the way it is. So the meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about — things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.\nWe talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr., Mr. Trump's son] had in that meeting. As I've said — most other people, you know, when they call up and say, \"By the way, we have information on your opponent,\" I think most politicians — I was just with a lot of people, they said [inaudible], \"Who wouldn't have taken a meeting like that?\" They just said——\nA lot of them. They said, \"Who wouldn't have taken a meeting like that?\"\nNah, a couple of them. They — now, that was before Russia was hot, don't forget. You know, Russia wasn't hot then. That was almost a year and a half ago. It wasn't like it is, like it is radioactive, then. Russia was Russia.\nWell, I never saw the email. I never saw the email until, you know——\nWell, Hillary did the reset. Somebody was saying today, and then I read, where Hillary Clinton was dying to get back with Russia. Her husband made a speech, got half a million bucks while she was secretary of state. She did the uranium deal, which is a horrible thing, while she was secretary of state, and got a lot of money.\nShe was opposing sanctions. She was totally opposed to any sanctions for Russia.\nI just saw it. I just saw it. She was opposed to sanctions, strongly opposed to sanctions on Russia.\nI don't really know. … But in that time. And don't forget, Crimea was given away during Obama. Not during Trump. In fact, I was on one of the shows, I said they're exactly right, they didn't have it as it exactly. But he was — this — Crimea was gone during the Obama administration, and he gave, he allowed it to get away. You know, he can talk tough all he wants, in the meantime he talked tough to North Korea. And he didn't actually. He didn't talk tough to North Korea. You know, we have a big problem with North Korea. Big. Big, big. You look at all of the things, you look at the line in the sand. The red line in the sand in Syria. He didn't do the shot. I did the shot. Had he done that shot, he wouldn't have had — had he done something dramatic, because if you remember, they had a tremendous gas attack after he made that statement. Much bigger than the one they had with me.\nSarin. And, and tremendous numbers of people were killed, young people, children. And he didn't do anything. That was a famous weekend where they were all asking him to do it, do it, do it. They thought they had it, and then he — not easy to do, I will say this, 'cause when I had to make that decision, I was with the president of China, and General Mattis [Defense Secretary Jim Mattis] said, \"We're locked and loaded, sir,\" and I'm saying [mumbles], you know. [mumbles] Look, you're killing people.\nYou hate it, it's tough. Obama — you know, I can understand it in a way, but some things you have to do. But it's, it's a tough, it's a tough decision to make.\nWell, I thought originally it might have had to do something with the payment by Russia of the D.N.C. Somewhere I heard that. Like, it was an illegal act done by the D.N.C., or the Democrats. That's what I had heard. Now, I don't know where I heard it, but I had heard that it had to do something with illegal acts with respect to the D.N.C. Now, you know, when you look at the kind of stuff that came out, that was, that was some pretty horrific things came out of that. But that's what I had heard. But I don't know what it means. All I know is this: When somebody calls up and they say, \"We have infor—\" Look what they did to me with Russia, and it was totally phony stuff.\nThe dossier.\nNow, that was totally made-up stuff, and in fact, that guy's being sued by somebody. … And he's dying with the lawsuit. I know a lot about those guys, they're phony guys. They make up whatever they want. Just not my thing — plus, I have witnesses, because I went there with a group of people. You know, I went there with Phil Ruffin——\nKeith was there. He said, \"What kind of crap is this?\" I went there for one day for the Miss Universe contest, I turned around, I went back. It was so disgraceful. It was so disgraceful.\nWhen he [James B. Comey] brought it [the dossier] to me, I said this is really made-up junk. I didn't think about anything. I just thought about, man, this is such a phony deal.\nI said, this is — honestly, it was so wrong, and they didn't know I was just there for a very short period of time. It was so wrong, and I was with groups of people. It was so wrong that I really didn't, I didn't think about motive. I didn't know what to think other than, this is really phony stuff.\nI think he shared it so that I would — because the other three people left, and he showed it to me.\nSo anyway, in my opinion, he shared it so that I would think he had it out there.\nYeah, I think so. In retrospect. In retrospect. You know, when he wrote me the letter, he said, \"You have every right to fire me,\" blah blah blah. Right? He said, \"You have every right to fire me.\" I said, that's a very strange — you know, over the years, I've hired a lot of people, I've fired a lot of people. Nobody has ever written me a letter back that you have every right to fire me.\nComey wrote a letter.\nI thought it was to me, right?\nIt might have been. It was just a very strange letter to say that.\nWhat was the purpose in repeating that?\nDo you understand what I mean? Why would somebody say, \"He has every right to fire me,\" bah bah bah. Why wouldn't you just say, \"Hey, I've retired …\"\nIt was very — a lot of people have commented that.\nI think I did a great thing for the American people.\nIt's okay. I have headaches, that's what I have, I have headaches. … But you know what, I think I did a great thing for the American people.\nWell, it could've been. It could've been. I feel like it was very dishonest when he wouldn't say what he knew he said to the public. I thought that was very honest. And I thought that he did that for the reason I just said.\nI don't know. Nobody has contacted me about anything.\nBecause I have done nothing wrong. A special counsel should never have been appointed in this case.\nBecause so far, the only — yeah, you can put it down.\nLook, Sessions gets the job. Right after he gets the job, he recuses himself.\nWell, Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.\nZero. So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself. I then have — which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, \"Thanks, Jeff, but I can't, you know, I'm not going to take you.\" It's extremely unfair, and that's a mild word, to the president. So he recuses himself. I then end up with a second man, who's a deputy.\nWho is he? And Jeff hardly knew. He's from Baltimore.\nYeah, what Jeff Sessions did was he recused himself right after, right after he became attorney general. And I said, \"Why didn't you tell me this before?\" I would have — then I said, \"Who's your deputy?\" So his deputy he hardly knew, and that's Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, who is from Baltimore. There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any. So, he's from Baltimore. Now, he, we went through a lot of things. We were interviewing replacements at the F.B.I. Did you know Mueller was one of the people that was being interviewed?\nHe was sitting in that chair. We had a wonderful meeting.\nThe day before! Of course, he was up here, and he wanted the job.\nSo, now what happens is, he leaves the office. Rosenstein leaves the office. The next day, he is appointed special counsel. I said, what the hell is this all about? Talk about conflicts? But he was interviewing for the job. There were many other conflicts that I haven't said, but I will at some point. So Jeff Sessions, Jeff Sessions gave some bad answers.\nYeah, he gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren't. He then becomes attorney general, and he then announces he's going to recuse himself. Why wouldn't he have told me that before?\nI don't know.\nLook, there are so many conflicts that everybody has. Then Rosenstein becomes extremely angry because of Comey's Wednesday press conference, where he said that he would do the same thing he did a year ago with Hillary Clinton, and Rosenstein became extremely angry at that because, as a prosecutor, he knows that Comey did the wrong thing. Totally wrong thing. And he gives me a letter, O.K., he gives me a letter about Comey. And by the way, that was a tough letter, O.K. Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn't hurt to have the letter, O.K. But he gives me a very strong letter, and now he's involved in the case. Well, that's a conflict of interest. Do you know how many conflicts of interests there are? But then, then Comey also says that he did something in order to get the special prose— special counsel. He leaked. The reason he leaked. So, he illegally leaked.\nSo think of this. Mike. He illegally leaks, and everyone thinks it is illegal, and by the way, it looks like it's classified and all that stuff. So he got — not a smart guy — he got tricked into that, because they didn't even ask him that question. They asked him another question, O.K.?________\nHe said I said \"hope\" — \"I hope you can treat Flynn good\" or something like that. I didn't say anything.\nBut even if he did — like I said at the news conference on the, you know, Rose Garden — even if I did, that's not — other people go a step further. I could have ended that whole thing just by saying — they say it can't be obstruction because you can say: \"It's ended. It's over. Period.\"\nAnd nothing was changed other than Richard Nixon came along. And when Nixon came along [inaudible] was pretty brutal, and out of courtesy, the F.B.I. started reporting to the Department of Justice. But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress. There was nothing — anything. But the F.B.I. person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting. You know, which is interesting. And I think we're going to have a great new F.B.I. director.\nHe's highly thought of by everybody. I think I did the country a great service with respect to Comey.\nNo, no.\nNo. That was the other thing. I told people to get out of the room. Why would I do that?\nNot much. Not even that I remember. He was sitting, and I don't remember even talking to him about any of this stuff. He said I asked people to go. Look, you look at his testimony. His testimony is loaded up with lies, O.K.? But people didn't — we had a couple people that said — Hi baby, how are you?\nMy granddaughter Arabella, who speaks — say hello to them in Chinese.\nThis is Ivanka. You know Ivanka.\nShe's great. She speaks fluent Chinese. She's amazing.\nShe spoke with President Xi [Jinping of China]. Honey? Can you say a few words in Chinese? Say, like, \"I love you, Grandpa\" —\nShe's unbelievable, huh?\nGood, smart genes.\nSo the bottom line is this. The country's doing well. We are, we are moving forward with a lot of great things. The unemployment is the lowest it's been in 16 years. The stock market is the highest it's ever been. It's up almost 20 percent since I took office. And we're working hard on health care. Um, the Russian investigation — it's not an investigation, it's not on me — you know, they're looking at a lot of things.\nThey're looking at a big picture.\nBy the way, it's everybody.\nYou know, Peter, I didn't look into it very closely, to be honest with you.\nI just heard there was an email requesting a meeting or something — yeah, requesting a meeting. That they have information on Hillary Clinton, and I said — I mean, this was standard political stuff.\nNo, I didn't know anything about the meeting.\nIt must have been a very important — must have been a very unimportant meeting, because I never even heard about it.\nNo, nobody told me. I didn't know noth—— It's a very unimportant — sounded like a very unimportant meeting.\nNumber one, remember, I made many of those speeches.\nMany of those speeches. I'd go after her all the time.\nBut there was something about the book, \"Clinton Cash,\" came out.\nBut we were developing a whole thing. There was something about \"Clinton Cash.\"\nPeter, that's all I did, was make those speeches about her. … I don't think I added anything much different than I had been doing. … I've made some very strong speeches about the corrupt emails. The 33,000 emails being deleted and bleached, and all of the things she was doing. I would make those speeches routinely. … There wasn't much I could say about Hillary Clinton that was worse than what I was already saying.\nI mean, I was talking about, she deleted and bleached, which nobody does because of the cost. How she got away with that one, I have no idea. 33,000 emails. I talked about the back of the plane, I talked about the uranium deal, I talked about the speech that Russia gave Clinton — $500,000 while she was secretary of state — the husband. I talked about the back of the plane — honestly, Peter, I mean, unless somebody said that she shot somebody in the back, there wasn't much I could add to my repertoire.\nI mean, look at what we have now. We have a director of the F.B.I., acting, who received $700,000, whose wife received $700,000 from, essentially, Hillary Clinton. 'Cause it was through Terry. Which is Hillary Clinton.\nMcCabe's wife. She got $700,000, and he's at the F.B.I. I mean, how do you think that? But when you say that — and think about this for a second. I don't think — you could give me a whole string of new information. I don't think I could really have — there's only so much. You know, you can only say many things. After that it gets boring, O.K.? How can it be better than deleting emails after you get a subpoena from the United States Congress? Guys go to jail for that, when they delete an email from a civil case. Here, she gets an email from the United States Congress —\nWhat?\nI don't want to say that. I mean, I don't want to say.\nYou understand what I mean, Peter.\nI mean, supposing they were able to give me additional — it wouldn't have helped me. I had so much stuff——\nAnd I couldn't have been better than the stuff I had. Obviously, because I won.\nI would say yeah. I would say yes. By the way, I would say, I don't — I don't — I mean, it's possible there's a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows? I don't make money from Russia. In fact, I put out a letter saying that I don't make — from one of the most highly respected law firms, accounting firms. I don't have buildings in Russia. They said I own buildings in Russia. I don't. They said I made money from Russia. I don't. It's not my thing. I don't, I don't do that. Over the years, I've looked at maybe doing a deal in Russia, but I never did one. Other than I held the Miss Universe pageant there eight, nine years [crosstalk].\nNo, I think that's a violation. Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company. And actually, when I do my filings, peoples say, \"Man.\" People have no idea how successful this is. It's a great company. But I don't even think about the company anymore. I think about this. 'Cause one thing, when you do this, companies seem very trivial. O.K.? I really mean that. They seem very trivial. But I have no income from Russia. I don't do business with Russia. The gentleman that you mentioned, with his son, two nice people. But basically, they brought the Miss Universe pageant to Russia to open up, you know, one of their jobs. Perhaps the convention center where it was held. It was a nice evening, and I left. I left, you know, I left Moscow. It wasn't Moscow, it was outside of Moscow.\nI can't, I can't answer that question because I don't think it's going to happen.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-peter-baker-the-new-york-times"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Sa'ad al-Hariri of Lebanon", "Date": "2017-07-25", "Text": "Thank you very much. Please. I'm very happy to announce that, with zero of the Democrats' votes, the motion to proceed on health care has just passed, and now we move forward towards truly great health care for the American people. We look forward to that. This was a big step.\nI want to thank Senator John McCain, very brave man. He made a tough trip to get here and vote. So we want to thank Senator McCain and all of the Republicans. We passed it without one Democrat vote. And that's a shame, but that's the way it is, and it's very unfortunate.\nBut I want to congratulate American people because we're going to give you great health care. And we're going to get rid of Obamacare which should have been, frankly, terminated long ago. It's been a disaster for the American people.\nThank you very much.\nGood afternoon and thank you all for being here. It is my honor to welcome Prime Minister Sa'ad Hariri of Lebanon to the White House.\nThe Prime Minister and I have just concluded an extensive conversation about the challenges and opportunities facing Lebanon and its neighbors. Lebanon is on the frontlines in the fight against ISIS, Al Qaida, and Hizballah. The Lebanese people, of all faiths, are working together to keep their country—and you know this, and we've been discussing this at great length—their country safe and prosperous. They love their country, and they're going to keep it safe and prosperous.\n——and very important. I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and the enduring friendship between the American and Lebanese peoples.\nThank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister.\nThank you very much.\nMargaret Talev [Bloomberg News], please.\nHello, Margaret.\nWell, I don't think I am doing that, but I am disappointed in the Attorney General. He should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office. And if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else. So I think that's a bad thing not for the President, but for the Presidency. I think it's unfair to the Presidency. And that's the way I feel. Thank you.\nYou don't give up. That's okay. [Laughter]\nI'll be making my position very clear over the next 24 hours. We're going to see what is exactly taking place. I have meetings with some of my very expert military representatives and others, so I'll be making that decision very shortly. Okay? Thank you.\nWhose role?\nI'll be talking about that tomorrow.\nBlake Burman [Fox Business Network]. Thank you. Hello, Blake.\nI want the Attorney General to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before, at a very important level. These are intelligence agencies. We cannot have that happen. You know many of my views in addition to that, but I think that's one of the very important things that they have to get on with.\nI told you before, I'm very disappointed with the Attorney General, but we will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell.\nOn health care, I'm extremely happy that we got this vote. This is—they say, if you look historically, this is the tough vote to get. Now, we're all going to sit together, and we're going to try and come up with something that's really spectacular. We have a lot of options and a lot of great options. And the Republican Senators really went out there. It's not easy when you have 52 Senators and you have a bloc of 48 voting against you. No matter what it is, no matter how good it sounds, it's very hard to get the kind of numbers that we got. We ended up with 51 votes—51 to whatever. I don't know what it is. Yes, 51 to 50.\nSo we had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think. It's very, very sad for them. But I'm very, very happy with the result. I believe now we will, over the next week or two, come up with a plan that's going to be really, really wonderful for the American people.\nObamacare is a disaster. It's failing on every front. It's too expensive. It gives horrible coverage. It was gotten by a lie, 28 times. It was a lie. You can keep your doctor; you can keep your plan—all lies. And the people are sick of it. And we're going to come up with a great health care that satisfies the needs of the people that we serve, which is the people of the United States.\nI will say—and I said it right at the beginning—health care is always difficult, because you have to weed a very, very narrow path, like a quarter of an inch wide, right down the middle. And if you go a little bit too far right, you lose three people on the left. And if you go a little bit too far left, you lose five people on the right. It is a very, very complex and difficult task, but it's something I actually know quite a bit about. I want to just thank some of the Republican Senators, who were really fantastic in getting us here, in particular John McCain for making the trip.\nBut I think you're going to have a great health care. This is the beginning of the end for the disaster known as Obamacare.\nThank you very much.\nWell, we are helping. And one of the things that we have made tremendous strides at is getting rid of ISIS. We have generals that don't like to talk; they like to do. And we were with General Mattis last night, and the success they've had against ISIS is extraordinary. We've made more progress in the last 4 or 5 months than previous—really, I could say, the previous administration made in 8 years.\nAnd then, we have to see what we have to see. But I will tell you, ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, ISIS in other locations—we have made tremendous strides. Our military is an incredible fighting force. And as you know, I let the commanders on the ground do what they had to do. Before, they used to have to call in this beautiful house and speak to people that didn't know what was happening: where they were; what locations; practically, probably never heard of the countries they were talking about or the towns. I let the generals do what they had to do. And we have made tremendous plans. We were discussing it just before. We have made tremendous gains with respect to ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and other places.\nThank you.\nAsad?\nThank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nMr. Prime Minister, thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-saad-al-hariri-lebanon"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland", "Date": "2017-08-28", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much. It is my great honor to welcome President Niinistö to the White House. We've just concluded a very positive meeting.\nAnd I want to begin today by extending my thoughts and prayers for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and the catastrophe of flooding and all of the other difficulties that they're currently going through in Houston, in Southeast Texas. And now it's looking more and more like the State of Louisiana will be also affected.\nMy administration is coordinating closely with State and local authorities in Texas and Louisiana to save lives, and we thank our first responders and all of those involved in their efforts. We're working directly with Texas Governor Greg Abbott—who, by the way, is doing a fantastic job—and his entire staff, likewise, as well as with Governor John Bel Edwards, who's very much involved in starting the process of Louisiana. We've pledged our full support as Texas and Louisiana battle and recover from this very devastating and historic storm. There's probably never been anything like this.\nUnder the supervision of FEMA Administrator Brock Long, there has been a tremendous amount of work done. He has been so outstanding in so many ways. More than 8,500 Federal workers are involved in the Texas effort alone. I've also today declared emergencies in Louisiana at the request of Governor Edwards.\nRecovery will be a long and difficult road, and the Federal Government stands ready, willing, and able to support that effort. Right now the single most important thing is the safety and security of those still in harm's way, including the first responders who have been so terrific and brave. Protecting the lives of our people is my highest priority. Every asset at my command is at the disposal of local officials.\nTragic times such as these bring out the best in America's character. Strength, charity, and resilience are those characters. We see neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend, and stranger helping stranger. And you see that all over. You watch on television, you just see such incredible work and love and teamwork. We are one American family. We hurt together, we struggle together, and believe me, we endure together. We are one family.\nTo the people of Texas and Louisiana: We are 100 percent with you. We're praying for you; we're working closely with your leaders and officials. And I will be visiting the impact zone tomorrow to ensure that you're receiving full support and cooperation from the Federal Government. And on Saturday, we think we're going back to Texas, and also, we will be going to Louisiana.\nNothing can defeat the unbreakable spirit of people of Texas and Louisiana. Right now every American heart sends its love and support to those whose lives have been upended—totally upended, totally—by this very horrible storm.\nWe ask God for his wisdom and strength. We will get through this. We will come out stronger. And believe me, we will be bigger, better, stronger than ever before. The rebuilding will begin, and in the end, it will be something very special. And I just want to thank everybody in the affected area, because it has been absolutely incredible to watch: the spirit, the cooperation, and the love.\nI would also like to share a message to the people of Finland who have recently suffered a terrorist attack in Turku: We stand in solidarity with you against the terrorist threat. We must all work together to deny terrorists safe havens, cut off their finances, and defeat their very wicked ideology.\nThank you.\nPresident Niinistö.We have been closely following Hurricane Harvey. Our thoughts are with the people of Texas and Louisiana. They and you, Mr. President, have shown strength and courage to overcome this catastrophe. It has been touching to watch the TV and see how people help each other. That is what we basically are built of: helping each other.\nFinland highly appreciates our close relationship with the United States. Today, they are broader than ever, ranging from security to defense cooperation, to trade and innovation. We are indeed celebrating our hundred years of independence. I want to thank you for the generous gift presented to the Fulbright Finland Foundation.\nI want to also—to take this opportunity to greet the almost 700,000 Americans who have Finnish origin. Mr. President and I exchanged views on several international issues. Our broad headline was security. We discussed the importance of the transatlantic bond between the European Union and the United States. History has taught us Europeans the value of unity.\nThank you very much. Thank you very much.\nSo we'll take a couple of questions. How about we go to Texas? Todd Gillman [Dallas Morning News]. Todd. Hello, Todd.\nYes.\nNo, Todd. I think that you're going to very rapid action from Congress, certainly from the President. And you're going to get your funding. It's a terrible tragedy. Your Governor has been absolutely outstanding in the job he's done and his entire staff.\nAnd I will say that—I just spoke with Greg, and he is working, like, 24/7. We expect to have requests on our desk fairly soon, and we think that Congress will feel very much the way I feel. Very—in a very bipartisan way, that will be nice. But we think you're going to have what you need, and it's going to go fast.\nTexas is a unique place. It's a great, great State, great people, and I think you you'll be up and running very, very quickly. Really, very quickly. So yes, I think you're going to be in fantastic shape. I've already spoken to Congress, and everybody feels for you and feels for what you're going through. But at the same time, they have great respect—even additional respect for the State—because you've handled it so well, so brilliantly.\nBut it's a long road. Still pouring, still a lot of rain. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. They've—I've heard the words \"epic,\" I've heard \"historic\"—that's what it is. But you will have what you want, I think, very, very quickly.\nAnd, Todd, you can ask a question to the President too.\nI think it has nothing to do with it, really. I think this is separate. This is going to go really very, very quickly. Again, I have spoken to many of the people we're talking about, and everybody feels the same way I do.\nYou have a question?\nPresident Niinistö.Finnish Broadcasting Company. Where you are? Okay.\nWell, I consider many countries as a security threat, unfortunately, when you look at what's going on in the world today. As you know, a few weeks ago our great Vice President, Mike Pence, who's right here, was in the region and spent quite a bit of time there. We consider that a very, very important part of the world. We have great relationships there. We have a great relationship with Finland.\nAnd so I would consider many countries threats, but these are all threats that we'll be able to handle if we have to. Hopefully, we won't have to handle them, but if we do, we will handle them.\nWell, we are very protective of that region. That's all I can say. We are very, very protective. We have great friends there, great relationships there. We are extremely protective. Okay? Thank you.\nA question for the President? Yes.\nPresident Niinistö.No. Sometimes, he——\nDo you have a question for the President? Do you have a question for the President?\nIt's all right. Somebody else could.\nPresident Niinistö.You don't have to. [Laughter]\n——in particular, on the Arctic and black carbon. And I think we have much in agreement.\nOne of the things we also agree on: We want crystal-clean water, and we want clean air, the cleanest ever. Very important. So we have a lot of agreement.\nJohn Roberts [Fox News]. Yes.\nWell, a lot of people think it was the right thing to do, John. And actually, in the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally. You know, the hurricane was just starting, and I put it out that I had pardoned, as we call—as we say, Sheriff Joe.\nHe's done a great job for the people of Arizona. He's very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. He is loved in Arizona. I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started, as you know. And he lost in a fairly close election. He would have won the election, but they just hammered him just before the election. I thought that was a very, very unfair thing to do.\nWhen I mentioned him the other night—you saw the massive crowd we had—the people went crazy when I said, \"What do you think of Sheriff Joe?\" or something to that effect. The place went absolutely crazy when I was in Arizona last week.\nAnd as far as pardons are concerned, I actually did this just before the meeting, because I assumed that somebody would ask me the question. I didn't know it would be you, as you can attest. You didn't even know you were going to be called. But I thought I would. And you know, Sheriff Joe is a great veteran of the military, great law enforcement person, somebody that's won many, many elections in the State of Arizona. But I wanted to look at some of the other people that were pardoned over the years.\nAnd if you look at, as an example, President Clinton pardoned Marc Rich, who was charged with crimes going back decades, including illegally buying oil from Iran while it held 53 American hostages—wasn't allowed to do that—selling to the enemies of the United States. He was pardoned after his wife donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clintons.\nThen, you have dangerous criminals. President Clinton pardoned Susan Rosenberg, a member of the Weathered Underground, charged as part of a bank robbery that led to a guard and two police officers being killed. Drug dealers: President Clinton commuted the sentence of Carlos Vignali, a central player in a cocaine ring that stretched from California to Minnesota. Criminal leaker, you've heard the word \"leaker.\" President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to WikiLeaks, perhaps and others. But a horrible, horrible thing that he did. Commuted the sentence and perhaps pardoned. President Obama commuted the sentence of Oscar Lòpez Rivera, who was charged as part of a violent independence group from Puerto Rico, responsible for 28 Chicago-area bombings and many deaths in the 1970s and 1980s.\nSheriff Joe is a patriot. Sheriff Joe loves our country. Sheriff Joe protected our borders. And Sheriff Joe was very unfairly treated by the Obama administration, especially right before an election, an election that he would have won. So—and he was elected many times. So I stand by my pardon of Sheriff Joe, and I think the people of Arizona, who really know him best, would agree with me.\nThank you very much.\nOkay?\nPresident Niinistö.Yes.\nI know there might be a couple of more questions, but do you want to take one more? Would you want to take one more? Go ahead, pick. [Laughter] Go ahead.\nPresident Niinistö.Please.\nAgain? You're going to give her the same one?\nPresident Niinistö.No, she's not the same lady. [Laughter]\nOther one. Go ahead.\nPresident Niinistö.They are sitting side by side.\nGo ahead.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Finland-Russia RelationsQ.Mr. President Trump, what kind of role do you see as Finland having in the U.S.-Russia relations? Do you think Finland could be of assistance, helping U.S. get better relations with Russia?\nWell, I hope that we do have good relations with Russia. I say it loud and clear; I've been saying it for years: I think it's a good thing if we have great relationships or at least good relationships with Russia. That's very important, and I believe someday that will happen. It's a big country, it's a nuclear country, it's a country that we should get along with, and I think we will eventually get along with Russia.\nFinland is respected by Russia. Finland has been free of Russia, really—just about one of the few countries in the region that has been—for a hundred years. And Russia has a lot of respect for Finland, so that's always good. But I think Finland is doing fine with Russia, and I hope that the United States will someday be able to have a very good relationship with Russia also. I think that's very good for world peace and for other things.\nThank you.\nFinland-U.S. Relations/Finland's Military Capacity\nWell, as I said before, that, you know, our relationship with Finland is a very close one, and we're always ready to help Finland. One of the things that is happening is, you're purchasing large amounts of our great F-18 aircraft from Boeing, and it's one of the great planes, one of the great fighter jets, and you're purchasing lots of other military equipment and, I think, purchasing very wisely. I know all of the military equipment, and I actually agree with everything you purchased. We talked about it before.\nI think Finland is really a respected country militarily. It's got large armed forces for its size as a country, really, proportionally, probably one of the biggest in the world if you think of it.\nPresident Niinistö.I guess so.\nBut they're very respected militarily, and they're respected beyond militarily. So, hopefully, it will never come to that. Thank you.\nYes, go ahead.\nFederal Emergency Management Agency/Hurricane Harvey Response and Recovery EffortsQ.Thank you, Mr. President. Trey Yingst with One America News. In the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, do you believe that cutting FEMA's budget is the right thing to do?\nNo, I think what's going to happen is, the FEMA money is relatively small compared to the rebuilding money. So FEMA, right now we have the money necessary for Texas and Louisiana, if we need, but the all—the real number, which will be many billions of dollars, will go through Congress. I think it'll happen very quickly, it'll go very fast, and I want to congratulate you on the network. It's a great network.\nYes.\nYes, it will. One way or the other, Mexico's going to pay for the wall. That's right.\nIt may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall.\nWe're right now negotiating NAFTA. In my opinion, Mexico has been very difficult, as they should be. Why wouldn't they be? They had a sweetheart deal for so many years. It's one of the great deals of all time for them. One of the worst trade deals ever signed. I guarantee you, Mr. President, Finland would never have signed NAFTA with Russia or whoever you wanted. [Laughter] This is not a deal that you would want to sign. This is not a deal that Finland would know about. [Laughter]\nNAFTA is one of the worst trade deals ever signed at any time, anywhere in the world. And I can understand why Mexico is being difficult, because why wouldn't they be? They've had it their way.\nBut no, Mexico will pay for the wall. It may be through a reimbursement. We need the wall very badly. As you know, Mexico has a tremendous crime problem—tremendous—one of the number two or three in the world. And that's another reason we need it. And the—just to add on, tremendous drugs are pouring into the United States at levels that nobody has ever seen before. This happened over the last 3 to 4 years in particular. The wall will stop much of the drugs from pouring into this country and poisoning our youth.\nSo we need the wall. It's imperative. We may fund it through the United States. But ultimately, Mexico will pay for the wall.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-sauli-niinisto-finland"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Amir Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah of Kuwait", "Date": "2017-09-07", "Text": "Good afternoon, and thank you for all being here. It's my great honor to welcome His Highness the Amir of Kuwait to the White House. The United States and Kuwait share a strong and enduring partnership. We recently commenced [commemorated; White House correction.] the 27th day of remembrance of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, which we all remember so well. The United States is proud to have contributed to the liberation of Kuwait and for the friendship we have built together in the years since.\nToday we reaffirm our commitment to our shared security interests and recognize Kuwait's critical contributions to regional stability. We also thank Kuwait for its humanitarian leadership and for its partnership in the fight to destroy ISIS. During my trip to Saudi Arabia, I spoke to the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations about the need to confront our shared enemies: murderous terror groups that threaten all civilized people. Every responsible nation must work together to strip these groups of their territory, their financing, and the false allure of their evil ideology.\nI applaud Kuwait for its role in this effort and encourage all nations in the region to do their fair share in defeating those who wage war on the innocent. Each nation in the region must decide what kind of future they want for their own children: one of violence or one of peace. That also means confronting those, such as the Iranian regime, who support terror groups and radical militias.\nCooperation between America and Kuwait has never been stronger—never, ever. The FBI and the Kuwaiti Government are expanding our counterterrorism and intelligence-sharing efforts. We are making progress on promoting Kuwaiti investments in the United States. They're making tremendous investments in our country. They have great confidence in our country. We're also entering a bilateral agreement with Kuwait regarding customs enforcement.\nDuring the same period and the same trip to Saudi Arabia—which was my great honor representing our incredible country—His Highness personally asked me to expedite a $5 billion agreement for the sale of American F/A-18 Super Hornet fighting jets for Kuwait. I am pleased to report that the State Department has now authorized this transfer and purchase, which will not only strengthen our mutual security, but will greatly benefit American workers.\nKuwaiti's investments in America through its sovereign wealth fund are profitable for Kuwaiti people, and they create many, many jobs in the American workforce. I am pleased to report this year that Kuwait has taken delivery of 10 American-made Boeing 777 airliners. They're beauties. American workers build the best planes in the world by far, and we want them to be made available for those countries that want them. And Kuwait has been a big buyer of commercial airliners made by Boeing and others.\nOur partnership extends beyond shared economic and security interests. We're signing a memorandum to deepen the close educational ties between our two countries, enhancing English language, and that's what we're going to be doing—we're enhancing the whole relationship through the use of the English language. And that is something that's very exciting, I think, for both of us.\nI want to thank His Highness for his leadership role and the role he's playing to help the nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council follow through on their pledges from all over. Because we went to Saudi Arabia, and the pledges of ending terrorist financing came from every country in that magnificent room, on that magnificent day. And we are addressing the ongoing GCC dispute, and the Amir is leading those discussions, and hopefully, it will be resolved very soon.\nWe call on our and Egyptian allies to focus on our commitments at that Saudi Arabia summit to continue our joint efforts to drive out and defeat terrorists. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt are all essential U.S. partners in this effort. We have great relationships with all of them right now, maybe better than we've ever had. We will be most successful with a united GCC.\nTomorrow Secretary of State Tillerson and Foreign Minister al-Sabah will chair the second U.S.-Kuwaiti Strategic Dialogue. By strengthening communications with allies like Kuwait, we send a strong message to both terrorist organizations and regional aggressors that they cannot win—they will not win; they cannot win against us; and our military is getting stronger and stronger and stronger—and that those who cherish and value human life will always prevail.\nI want to thank His Highness for joining us here today. The United States values its close friendship with Kuwait and its people, and we look forward to strengthening these bonds even further. Together, we will show the world that the forces of destruction and extremism are no match for the blessings of prosperity and peace.\nThank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nAll right, we'll take a couple of questions. Go ahead. Yes.\nActually, we'll go to somebody else this time, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. [Laughter] You've been doing enough, John. Go ahead, John.\nCBS [Major Garrett, CBS News].\nNorth Korea/U.S. Military Spending\nMilitary action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing is inevitable. It would be great if something else could be worked out. We would have to look at all of the details, all of the facts. But we've had Presidents for 25 years now—they've been talking, talking, talking—and the day after an agreement is reached, new work begins in North Korea, continuation on nuclear. So I would prefer not going the route of the military, but it's something certainly that could happen. Our military has never been stronger. We are in a position now—and you know the new orders. You see the new numbers just like I see the new numbers. It's been tens of billions of dollars more in investment. And each day, new equipment is delivered, new and beautiful equipment, the best in the world, the best anywhere in the world, by far. Hopefully we're not going to have to use it on North Korea. If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.\nDo you have a question for the Amir?\nWe're going to see what it is. I don't negotiate with you——\nNo, I'm not negotiating with you. Maybe we'll have a chance to negotiate with somebody else, but I don't put my negotiations on the table. Unlike past administrations, I don't talk about them. But I can tell you that North Korea is behaving badly, and it's got to stop.\nOkay, a question for the Amir?\nQuestion for the—yes, for the Amir first, yes.\nOh.\nWell, I do appreciate and respect the mediation. I would be willing to be the mediator. I was telling the Amir before that if I can help between U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, where I have a very great relationship—I spoke with the King yesterday, King Salman, who is a friend of mine, and we spoke on unrelated subjects, but we had a long conversation. If I can help mediate between Qatar and, in particular, the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, I would be willing to do so. And I think you'd have a deal worked out very quickly. I think it's something that's going to get solved fairly easily. Kuwait has been really the leader of getting it solved, and we appreciate that very much. But I do believe that we'll solve it. If we don't solve it, I will be a mediator right here in the White House. We'll come together. Very quickly, I think, we'll have something solved.\nThank you. Go ahead.\nWell, first of all, the Palestinians and the Israelis, we are discussing; we are working. They say it is the world's most complex and difficult deal. You know that. But it is something that could happen. I believe that the relationships that we have with both can help. It's a—an event that's just never taken place. Sometimes, people think they're close, and it never happens, or it never happens successfully.\nI think we have a chance of doing it. I think the Palestinians would like to see it happen. I think the Israelis would like to see it happen. And usually, when you have two groups that would like to see something happen, good things can happen.\nSo I think there is a chance that there could be peace. But again, I say that a little bit reluctantly. We're going to give it our best. We have tremendous talent working on that particular transaction. As you know, David Friedman, the Ambassador, is very much involved. We have a great group of people. We'll see what happens.\nAs far as the chemical weapons, I find it hard to believe that after what we did the last time, that Asad would do that again. I haven't heard what you just said, but I find that a little bit difficult to believe. But nothing would change. We would be extremely upset if he was using chemical weapons.\nAs far as Syria is concerned, we have very little to do with Syria other than killing ISIS. What we do is, we kill ISIS. And we have succeeded in that respect. We have done better in 8 months of my Presidency than the previous 8 years against ISIS. So ISIS is rapidly disappearing, as you know, and that's because of our great military. The military has been absolutely incredible in terms of what they've done with ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.\nDo you have a question for the Amir?\n[The reporter spoke in Arabic, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThis all began because of the fact that there has been massive funding of terrorism by certain countries. And what I want is, I want to stop the funding of terrorism, and we're going to stop the funding of terrorism. And if they don't stop the funding of terrorism, I don't want them to come together. But I think they will. Okay?\nYou have a question? Your people have a question, yes. Go ahead. To the Amir.\nWell, that is a problem that we will get resolved, and I'm very, very honored and happy to know that you have problems with the media also. [Laughter]\nThank you everybody. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-amir-sabah-al-ahmad-al-jabir-al-sabah-kuwait"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain", "Date": "2017-09-26", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. Please be seated. Good afternoon. I'm greatly honored to welcome President Mariano Rajoy of Spain, and it's a great honor to have you at the White House. Thank you very much. We've just concluded a very productive conversation on a crucial range of economic and security issues.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to take a moment to send America's hearts and prayers to the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Both have been devastated—and I mean absolutely devastated—by Hurricane Maria, and we're doing everything in our power to help the hard-hit people of both places, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. And a massive effort is underway, and we have been really treated very, very nicely by the Governor and by everybody else. They know how hard we're working and what a good job we're doing.\nAs we speak, FEMA, our great first responders, and all available Federal resources, including the military, are being marshaled to save lives, protect families, and begin a long and very, very difficult restoration process. I have directed all relevant departments and agencies to assist in the response and recovery effort.\nAs Governor Rosselló just told me this morning, the entire Federal workforce is doing great work in Puerto Rico, and I appreciated his saying it. And he's saying it to anybody that will listen. Our team has been incredible after having gone through Texas and then Florida, with other stops along the way. And he further went on, he said, \"And through the Trump administration's leadership, the relationship between FEMA and my team is very, very strong.\" I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday. I'll also be going to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nOver the last several weeks our Nation has been tested by the destructive force of Mother Nature, but we will respond to it with an even mightier force: the resolve of the American spirit. Texas, Louisiana, and Florida are in really good shape and moving along well. We thank all of the first responders and volunteers who have risked their lives. And that's what they did: They risked their lives.\nTo all of those impacted by the trouble and these horrible hurricanes and storms that have affected and impacted our country, I thank you. The recovery process will be a very, very difficult one. We will get through this, and we will get through it together. We will be stronger. We will be bigger. We will be better. Thank you very much.\nSpain-U.S. Relations\nThe United States and Spain are great friends and close allies. Our bonds, culture, and commerce go back many centuries. Our schools teach American children about Spain's history of exploration. Our museums treasure beautiful Spanish works of art. And your country's contributions to architecture, music, and film are admired all over the world. It's a greatly admired country. The deep relationship between our two people is a strong foundation for lasting cooperation. On behalf of the American people, I want to express our support and extend our prayers to all of those affected by the vile terror attack in Spain last month. I want to assure the people of Spain that America stands with you in confronting this evil that threatens all of humanity. We will continue to deny the terrorists their funding, their territory, and any form of support for their wicked ideology.\nIn this common fight, America greatly appreciates Spain's contribution to the coalition to defeat ISIS. Spanish troops and police have trained more than 30,000 members of the Iraqi security forces. We also thank the Spanish people for being such gracious hosts to the American servicemembers stationed at Spanish bases.\nThe United States and Spain together face many critical dangers and challenges, from North Korea to Iran to Venezuela. We thank Spain for its recent decision to expel its North Korean Ambassador and for standing with us in our efforts to isolate the brutal North Korean regime.\nIt is time for all responsible nations to join forces to isolate the North Korean menace. North Korean nuclear weapons and missile development threaten the entire world with unthinkable loss of life. All nations must act now to ensure the regime's complete denuclearization.\nI appreciate the United Nations Security Council voting twice, unanimously—15 to nothing, twice—to adopt hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea. I have recently issued tough new sanctions against those who do business with this outlaw regime, and I applaud China's latest action to restrict its trade with North Korea. And in particular, I applaud China for breaking off all banking relationships with North Korea, something that people would have thought unthinkable even 2 months ago. I want to thank President Xi.\nHere, in the Western Hemisphere, we have seen the heartbreaking tragedy of Maduro's socialist rule in Venezuela. Spain has been especially helpful in promoting the interests and well-being of the Venezuelan people, and we thank you for your efforts.\nWe hope our friends in the EU will soon follow the United States, Canada, and many Latin American nations in sanctioning the Maduro regime. We need everybody involved. The citizens of Venezuela have endured immense suffering, poverty, starvation, and dangerous political unrest under Maduro's oppressive socialist regime.\nTogether, Spain and the United States hope for peace, for the restoration of democracy, and for the release of all political prisoners. Wherever socialism spreads, misery follows. The people of Venezuela deserve a future of freedom. These are great people.\nIn the economic arena, we support trade that benefits both Spain and the United States, which means it must be fair and it must be reciprocal, such an important word. It hasn't been used very much in the United States: reciprocal. Spain is the 10th largest investor in the United States, and I commend Spanish business leaders for their confidence in America and the American worker. And considering the fact that our stock market has just hit alltime highs, I think they probably like the United States very much right now.\nThis is a time for both tremendous opportunity for our world, but also serious dangers. As I said at the United Nations, which future really is up to us. If we empower our citizens, serve their needs, and appeal to all that is best in the human spirit, then I have no doubt we will succeed like never, ever before. Mr. President, I look forward to working with you to build this future of prosperity and peace for both Spain and for the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nSteve Holland, please. Reuters. Don't get nervous, Steve. [Laughter]\nWell, I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL. I was ashamed of what was taking place, because to me that was a very important moment. I don't think you can disrespect our country, our flag, our national anthem. To me, the NFL situation is a very important situation. I've heard that before about, was I preoccupied? Not at all. Not at all. I have plenty of time on my hands. All I do is work.\nAnd to be honest with you, that's an important function of working. It's called respect for our country. Many people have died, many, many people. Many people are so horribly injured. I was at Walter Reed Hospital recently, and I saw so many great young people, and they're missing legs, and they're missing arms. And they've been so badly injured. And they were fighting for our country. They were fighting for our flag. They were fighting for our national anthem. And for people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem, I think, is disgraceful.\nSo I will also say that—again, I read you part of his quote—but the Governor of Puerto Rico is so thankful for the great job that we're doing. We did a great job in Texas, a great job in Florida, a great job in Louisiana. We hit little pieces of Georgia and Alabama. And frankly, we're doing—and it's the most difficult job because it's on the island. It's on an island in the middle of the ocean. It's out in the ocean. You can't just drive your trucks there from other States.\nAnd the Governor said we are doing a great job. In fact, he thanked me specifically for FEMA and all of the first responders in Puerto Rico. And we're also mentioning with that the U.S. Virgin Islands. It was devastated. So we are totally focused on that.\nBut at the same time, it doesn't take me long to put out a wrong, and maybe we'll get it right. I think it's a very important thing for the NFL to not allow people to kneel during the playing of our national anthem, to respect our country, and to respect our flag.\nOkay? Thank you.\nWell, I think that Spain is a great country and it should remain united. We're dealing with a great, great country, and it should remain united. I've been watching that unfold, but it's actually been unfolding for centuries. And I think that nobody knows if they're going to have a vote. I think the President would say they're not going to have a vote. But I think that the people would be very much opposed to that. I can say only speaking for myself, I would like to see Spain continue to be united.\nThank you. Major Garrett. Yes, CBS.\nYes, hi.\nOkay, well, I'll answer the second one first. We're totally prepared for the second option, not a preferred option. But if we take that option, it will be devastating—I can tell you that—devastating for North Korea. That's called the military option. If we have to take it, we will.\nHe's acting very badly. He's saying things that should never, ever be said. And we're replying to those things, but it's a reply. It's not an original statement, it's a reply. But the things that he said over the last year—and if you look back, the things that he said to past administrations—North Korea is a situation that should have been handled 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago, and 5 years ago, and it could have been handled much more easily. You had various administrations—many administrations—which left me a mess. But I'll fix the mess. So we'll see what happens with North Korea.\nAs far as Puerto Rico is concerned, I think just the opposite. We have had tremendous reviews from government officials, as we have in Texas and Louisiana, and as we have in Florida, as you know, from Governor Scott and Greg Abbott. Great Governors. And this morning the Governor made incredible statements about how well we're doing.\nWe understand it's a disaster; it's a disaster that just happened. The grid was in bad shape before the storm. And Puerto Rico didn't get hit by one hurricane, it got hit by two hurricanes, and they were among the biggest we've ever seen, with the second one being even worse. I mean, the second one hit Puerto Rico as a category 5. I don't believe anybody has ever seen that happen before: hit land with that kind of velocity. The Governor has been extremely generous, and I appreciated it. We right now have our top people from FEMA, and they have been there. We are unloading, on an hourly basis, massive loads of water and food and supplies for Puerto Rico.\nAnd this isn't like Florida where we can go right up the spine or like Texas where we go right down the middle and we distribute. This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff.\nThe Governor has been so incredible in his statements about the job we're doing. We're doing a great job. Don't forget, their police force has been decimated, because many of the police in Puerto Rico have lost their homes. So, sure, they want to be police, but they also want to be able to watch their families and find their families, and they have to live. So we're also very much involved in security in Puerto Rico.\nSo everybody has said it's amazing the job that we've done in Puerto Rico. We're very proud of it. And I'm going there on Tuesday. Now, with all of that being said, record—if you look at the amount of water dropped on that island, between the two hurricanes—and the first they just barely got by with, but they were devastated. And the second was a complete wipeout. I mean, this was a place that was destroyed.\nSo I think we've done a really good job. We're continuing to. We are literally unloading, on an hourly basis, water, food, supplies. We have our top people from FEMA and our first responders and everybody else. We're going to be deploying Navy ships—they've already been deployed. And we are going to do far more than anybody else would ever be able to do. And we're—it's being recognized as such, but it is a tough situation.\nWould you have a question for the President?\nWell, I think the people of Catalonia have been talking about this for a long time. But I'll bet you, if you had accurate numbers and accurate polling, you'd find that they love their country, they love Spain, and they wouldn't leave. So I'm just for a united Spain.\nI speak as the President of the United States, as somebody that has great respect for your President and also has really great—really great—respect for your country. I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to. Because you're talking about staying with a truly great, beautiful, and very historic country.\nMr. President, thank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-mariano-rajoy-brey-spain"}
{"Title": "Interview with Forbes Magazine Editor Randall Lane and Chief Product Officer Lewis D'Vorkin", "Date": "2017-10-06", "Text": "I am having fun. I'm enjoying it. We're accomplishing a lot. Your stock market is at an all-time high. Your jobs, your unemployment is at the lowest point in almost 17 years. We have fantastic numbers coming out. And I think we'll have, over the course of the next, fairly short period of time, and more importantly over a long period of time, we're going to have great numbers coming out of our country.\nD'Vorkin:What's your personal thought?\nI enjoy success. And we're having tremendous success, as a country. We have some difficulties with respect to North Korea, the Middle East. I inherited-- and I've said it often--I inherited a mess. The country was having many different problems. Among them, the Middle East, ISIS, which we've done more with respect to ISIS in nine months than we've done in nine years. But we have really done, we have done, I would say eight months in eight years, to be specific. But we have done a really, really good job with the military. We're building up our military. We just had an over $700 billion budget, which will be approved. We're, you know, there's been few times where the military was more important than what it is right now. And, in addition to that, which is by far the overriding element, it's lots of jobs in the United States. So, what the country is doing, we're doing very well. And on an economic front, we're doing very well.\nWell, I think it helped. It's certainly a different kind of job than, really there is anywhere. Because you have so many skills necessary. But certainly the campaign was successful. What people don't realize is that I spent much less money than Hillary Clinton. So right there, perhaps that's business. You know, if you look at the numbers it's astronomically different.\nI don't think anybody's ever written that. You know, in the old days, if you spent less money and won, that was supposed to be a good thing. Today nobody talks about it. But I spent much less money and won. I think that's--so we start off there--I think that was good. I also think that, yes, being in--just last night I had dinner with all of our generals and admirals, at the highest level. You probably saw that.\nIt was lovely. It was fantastic. But I talked about business. I said, \"Your equipment is coming in too slowly and at too great a cost.\" And I actually got involved in negotiating, as an example, the F-35 fighter with Lockheed. You may call Marillyn [Hewson], the head of Lockheed, who you know, I think.\nAnd she's a terrific person. But I developed a bidding system between Boeing and Lockheed. And I was able to reduce the price of the Lockheed by billions of dollars. By billions of dollars. And this took me, actually, a very small amount of time. And I read a story, and this when I was president-elect, had not come here yet. And I called the military. I said, \"What's the problem?\" We met with the generals. I then met with Lockheed. I then--the generals were unable to get anything off the price. And in fact, they wanted to raise the price and claim extras. And I met with Marillyn [Hewson], from Lockheed. I then went and had a very frank discussion with her. I then met with Boeing, and I said, \"Well, we're going to come out with a competing plane.\" And then went back to her. And I went back and forth. And the end result is billions and billions of dollars have been taken off the cost of the plane.\nAnd that's one thing. There are many, many things that I was too late into the game for the President Gerald Ford aircraft carrier. But it took too long to build, and it was way over budget. And you know, those things, we're being much more conscious as a country about things such as that.\nD'Vorkin:So you've had pain points in business, obviously.\nWell, I don't know.\nPain points?\nD'Vorkin:In other words, obstacles that you have to overcome.\nOh, sure. You always have obstacles.\nD'Vorkin:So, if you take away the politics of being president, and what you're trying to do with the economy, what are the obstacles that you are finding that you necessarily didn't find in your business life?\nWell, you have Congress. That's a big obstacle in many cases. You have, in some cases, well-meaning people in Congress that truly feel strongly about something. And I understand that and actually don't mind that. And then of course you have grandstanders and others that want to try and make a point or want to do something that really isn't necessarily in the best interests of the country. And those people I fight. And what people don't know is that I've had just about the most legislation passed of any president, in a nine-month period, that's ever served. We had over 50 bills passed. I'm not talking about executive orders only, which are very important. I'm talking about bills. We've had a tremendous amount of legislation passed. Like VA accountability, which nobody could get passed. Meaning people are accountable now, because before you couldn't do anything if you caught people who worked there doing very bad things. But many, many bills have been passed. And now we're going for taxes. I will get health care. I'm one vote short of health care. I'll get health care. And I think block-granting it back to the states is going to be a great thing to do. I think it'll be great for the people. Smaller government, great for the people. They'll be able to handle it better. But we're one--\nYeah, I like it very much. I do. I like it. It's block-granting. It's granting the money back to the states.\nAnd you have a smaller form of government that's going to be able to do--if they do a proper job--that will be able to do. There are certain states where they are very well run. And I could name them. I could name certain states where they really--they will do miracles with that money, in terms of health care. It'll be far better than it is. Because Obamacare has failed, badly. So I'm working on that now. But we actually, I would say, I either have the votes or I'm one vote short. And I believe we'll get health care done sometime prior to the election.\nWell, that's an interesting, that's a very interesting question. It's a failed concept. It's thousands and thousands of pages. It's been amended by additional thousands of pages. It's a total mess. The premiums are going up, you know.\nWell, we're actually, what we're doing is trying to keep it afloat, because it's failing. I mean the insurance companies are fleeing and have fled. They fled before I got here. But with that being said, no, Obamacare is Obama's fault. It's nobody else's fault. In fact, if you go back to--\nYes. But I've always said Obamacare is Obama's fault. It's never going to be our fault. With that being said, I think the Democrats want to make a deal. At the same time, I think I have a deal with the Republicans. So I have the best of both worlds. That's business to a certain extent--\n--when you asked the business question. And as you have noticed, I'm very able to make deals with Democrats if I have to.\nWell, the Republicans have something called the filibuster rule. Which is a disaster. And if they don't get rid of that, it's always going to be very tough for them. You know what that is.\nWell, you need eight Democrat votes every time. I mean, they literally need eight Democratic votes. And, they keep it for the sake of history. But history is that, in 1789, when it all began, what it actually, when they started voting, it was 1789, the first votes, that was a simple majority. And we should go back to a simple majority. If we had the filibuster rule, if we had the 60 votes for Justice Gorsuch, he would not be sitting on the bench right now because for the judges that has been taken off. And part of my plan is that the Democrats would take it off in two minutes. And the Republicans--\nWell, they were going to. Well, they did it for the judge. Don't forget, 95 percent of that work was done before we got there. So I think the filibuster rule is very bad. At the same time, I think if we pass taxes, I think we'll have health care and taxes before. I believe we'll have a great infrastructure bill before, which is easiest of all of them. In fact, I think I'll have more Democrat votes for infrastructure than I will Republican votes. And I also have another bill that I think will be very--an economic development bill, which I think will be fantastic. Which nobody knows about. Which you are hearing about for the first time. But I'm going to do that. But before--\nEconomic development incentives for companies. Incentives for companies to be here. Incentives for companies to do things.\nD'Vorkin:What kind of incentives?\nAnd it'll be a great bill. It's something I've had. I just don't want to do it before I do health care--\nSo that when companies leave our country, they get penalized severely. So that when companies stay in our country, they're incentivized. But there won't be any more companies, and it's really stuck. I hope you have seen--again, this is an interview where I am doing the talking, I guess--but I hope you've seen that companies are moving back into our country. You saw Toyota, five plants. Other companies, car companies are moving back into our country. They are expanding their plants.\nIt's both. It's both. It's both a carrot and a stick. It is an incentive to stay. But it is perhaps even more so--if you leave, it's going to be very tough for you to think that you're going to be able to sell your product back into our country.\nVery comfortable, because there's no tax if you stay. There's no tax. We have to protect our companies. And if you looked at what's happened, they've been ravaged by the stupidity of politics and, frankly, the stupidity of politicians. They've been ravaged. And we have to protect our companies. We have to protect our workers. And the only way you're going to do that is you have to create rules. I mean, when you talk about, Randall, when you talk about fairness, do you think it's fair that some countries charge us 100% tariff, or tax, to sell a product in their country? And yet the same product coming out of that country coming into our country comes into our country for no tax. See, that makes it unfair for our companies. And what I want to do is reciprocal. See, I think the concept of reciprocal is a very nice concept. If somebody is charging us 50 percent, we should charge them 50 percent. Right now they charge us 50 percent, and we charge them nothing. That doesn't work with me.\nYes.\nYes. This will not increase, this will lower the deficit, because I think we're going to take off like we have never taken off before. This is going to bring jobs back. This is going to bring $3 trillion dollars back.\nYeah, well, the offshore money.\nThat's part of it.\nYes.\nFirst of all, we're going to have some spending cuts, okay. We are going to really have some spending cuts. But I will tell you that most of what we are going to do is we're going to gain. Look at GDP. So GDP last quarter was 3.1%. Most of the folks that are in your business, and elsewhere, were saying that would not be hit for a long time. You know, Obama never hit the number.\nHe never hit it on a yearly basis. Never hit it on a yearly basis. That's eight years. I think we'll go substantially higher than that. And I think this quarter would have been phenomenal, except for the hurricanes. The hurricanes were very very--actually there was some really good things on the jobs report that just came out. You saw.\nThe hurricanes had a huge impact on and, you know, as soon as I saw the first hurricane I said, \"That's bad.\" Then I saw the second, the third, the fourth. But the hurricanes will have an impact of, could even be a point. I was saying a half a point, could even be a point. But that's somewhat artificial. Now, we're going to have some great success. What I'm saying, though, is that the tax cuts will spur business. Companies will stay in our country--they won't be leaving. Companies will be hiring people. They'll be expanding. They'll be building new plants, and that's what it's all about. It'll be a great spur, so through growth, our deficits will come down.\nWell, what I say is that the, this whole concept, everybody benefits if the country does well. We all do. You guys benefit. Everybody benefits if the country does well. We're the highest-taxed nation in the world--now some people like to say \"developed nation,\" but I haven't found too many that are higher. We're the highest-taxed developed nation in the world, probably the highest-taxed nation in the world. It makes it very uncompetitive when you're paying 42 and 44%, if you start including state taxes and other things that many businesses have to, depending on what state they're in, and in China you're at 15% and in other countries you're at numbers far lower than that. So, we're bringing it to 20, I was thinking in terms of 15.\nActually. The corporate tax rate. I was actually saying 15 for the purpose of getting to 20.\nBut it was a spread that I didn't like. You know I didn't want to be talking about, so we started at 20 with the understanding I'm not negotiating. I actually wanted the 15, so that, because as you know, this will be a negotiation--\n--for the next 30 days.\nBut I wanted the 15 in order to get to 20.\nDid you say Trump's not as rich? What?\nWell, we're going to have to see what happens. We're going to have to see what happens. The estate tax is for many, many family companies where people are forced to sell their businesses. That includes farms. But it includes a lot of businesses, any business--not even small businesses only. Large businesses also, where the estate tax is so onerous that families are forced to sell and some cases have fire sales and not get proper pricing. And in many cases, those businesses don't do very well after the family leaves. So that's the primary reasoning behind the estate tax. But we'll be talking about estate tax. We'll be talking about all of it. You know, it will be a very serious set of negotiations going on over the next period of time. But the estate tax is really for those businesses, of which there are many, that are forced to go out of business or forced to sell for that reason.\nWell, the big advantage that I would get is if the economy does well. That's a great thing for me--politically and otherwise. But the economy is a very--you know it's very interesting, Randall. I built a great business, but it doesn't mean anything to me. My children are running it. It doesn't mean anything to me anymore. I don't even think about it because this is so big, what I'm doing now, so big and so, so important because this country was going in the wrong direction. We were heading toward a really bad situation. And if you remember, when I got elected, the stock market dropped and then they heard my speech, and it dropped. And then it went up more than it dropped. It went down like 800 points, and then it went up a lot--whatever it was, much more than that. And then since then, it's gone--\nHow much?\nNo, 25 since the election. You have to go since the election.\"\nSince election day it's 25%. It has gone up since the Election Day $5.2 trillion--$5.2 trillion. If Hillary Clinton would have won, the markets would have gone down substantially. Instead of $5.2 trillion. It was interesting, I just saw the number today, $5.2 trillion. It was just announced that since election day, November 8, the markets have gone up $5.2 trillion dollars. They've gone up 25%. Because the Nasdaq was 26, et cetera, et cetera.\nD'Vorkin:One of your sons, I believe it was Eric, told Forbes that he would give you quarterly reports on the your business, on your former business. Is that happening?\nI have not seen a report. You know, I have, I built, I think the thing that I--look obviously people know I've been very successful but I built a truly great company with truly great assets and very little debt, and I don't think that's been recognized to the extent it should. And I don't care about it so much anymore because this is--you know, I'm here.\nYou know what? He may be doing quarterly reports. I haven't seen any yet. I know he's, you know, he's doing a very good job because I know the kind of person he is. He's running it with Don. And they're doing a very good job, I would imagine. But it's very good stuff that they're running.\nYeah. Yeah, I think so.\nYou see, you have to understand, if what I do is good for the middle class, that's also good for me, and then if I do what's good for the upper class, that's good for me. Don't forget--the companies that we're talking about--many people own some of these companies. And sometimes wealthy people own them, and sometimes poor people own them. But when we make life and business better for companies, that's a great thing for everybody, including me... . But people are dying to know if I have any benefit.\nAnd I ask them, and I tell them, most important, this is a jobs bill. This is a jobs tax cut and reform. It's a tax cut. It's a massive tax cut.\nWill be the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. It's a massive tax cut, and it's a reform. It's both.\nNo, because, no, because a tax cut will spur growth.\nWell, history has also shown the opposite. I mean, you've had it both ways. It has shown both ways.\nWell, during Reagan, during Reagan, during his cuts, he--tremendous growth.\nMy feeling is that we are losing so much business, and so many companies are leaving our country, and so many companies are doing so badly. Look at our steel industry. Look what's happening with our steel industry. Now I'm going to give them additional help, as you'll see later from economic development plans, because we're not going to let these industries be taken advantage of by the other countries. What has happened and what will be happening is not only will we have massive tax cuts and reform. Not only will we have the largest regulation cuts in the history of a presidency--there has never been a president who has cut regulations anywhere even close, and I'm not nearly finished. You know the ones I've done. And I'm actually doing one next week, which will be massive. But we've cut. Now, I believe in regulation, by the way, but it's got to be reasonable regulation. It can't take 21 years to build a highway--\n--to get approved.\nIt can't take, to put up a structure someplace, 15 years before you find out that you're not allowed to build it. You know, that's what's been happening. You saw what I did with Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline, approved within 24 hours--approved. In fact, the one is now built, and the other one's under construction. Forty-eight thousand jobs. Now we're going to have massive growth. We're going to have massive job production. We are going to, I think very, very importantly, help the companies because I'm going to be following this up with a bill that makes it more fair for our companies. One of the unfair, probably the--I won't even say the worst aspect, but one of the bad aspects--was taxes, but we have worse because some countries treat our companies so unfairly that it is almost impossible for them to compete. And we will be straightening that out in a different bill which will be coming, which I've never really discussed publicly very much, but which will be coming fairly soon after the tax cuts... . We have cut, we have cut regulations, or deregulation, but we have cut regulations more than any president ever in history, and it's not even close, and this is only nine months. And there's more coming. I don't know if you saw when I held up that highway chart a few months ago.\nWhere it took anywhere from 17 to 21 years. We have highways that have been under negotiation for decades. Roads, bridges--you know you can't build. Those days are over. We're trying to get it down to a maximum of 2 years, so that instead of 20 it'll be a maximum of 2. And, by the way, they may not get approved. But if they don't get approved, you're going to know fast. You're not going to be going 20 years and then find out you can't build.\nD'Vorkin:So besides your own vision for the Trump Organization and the success that you provide, you've always said talent matters. Talent you bring in matters. How do you feel that you've done so far with managing the talent that you've brought in to your White House, to your administration?\nWell, I think you have different kinds of talent. I have some that is terrific, that is unknown to the public for the most part, that has been incredible.\nI've had a lot. I hate to point them out because then when I don't point somebody out they're disappointed. And then I have had some that I've been disappointed in. I've had some that I thought would be very good that I'm not as happy as I thought. But I've had some--\n--I've had some disappointments. Excuse me?\nWell, I don't want to use examples now, but I've had some that I'm not, that I haven't been happy with and that frankly right now I'm not that thrilled with. I was disappointed. I thought they'd be better. And I've had some that turned out better than I thought.\nYou never know when to fire. You can meet somebody, and you can see somebody sitting in front of you, and you can even look at their record to a certain extent. Don't forget one of your early questions is: How does this compare with the business? Well, it is a different set of skills. You need more skill for this. And you need more heart. You also need more heart. Because a lot of your decisions here are based on what's good for people, not just what's good for the budget or what's good for the pocketbook. But, so it is, there are tremendous skill sets from the world of business that are great. But you need additional skill. You also need political skill--\nAnd you need political instinct. People in business, many people in business have no political instinct, or you don't know if they do. But I've had people that I'm extremely pleased with, that I actually think have been better than I would have thought. And I've had some--I mean for the most part I got it right--but I've had some that I'm disappointed. I've had some that I'm still disappointed.\nD'Vorkin:You're very public about that. Do you think that's a positive?\nYeah, I think it's positive. I think people understand it. That's the way life is, sure.\nHe came out of a great company. A company that has been around a long time. I don't mind opposing views, but he and I have some opposing views. I think we have to be a much, much stronger in stance. And, ultimately, my view matters. That's the way life goes. But I have a very good relationship with him. And generally speaking, we get along very well.\nWell, we may have to, if he did that--which he says he didn't, by the way, he said he didn't. And they announced with the State Department that he didn't. I think it's fake news, but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.\nBut so does everyone else.\nWell, one of the biggest advantages that I have, that somebody like me has, is that I was not in politics, so I haven't gotten to know Washington for 30 years. I don't know everybody here. I've had to make new relationships. So that's--\nNo, in some cases it wasn't a mistake. It might just be a different style. But overall I think I've got it right, and I think that there's always a lot of turnover, especially in the early years of a White House. But overall, I think I have a great group of people.\nWhat time is it, 12:30? That's all right. Feel free.\nNo, no, no, it's not taking me longer.\nIt's taking the obstructionist people.\nThat's because I don't need as many people. And that has to do with business also. And I've said that loud and clear, but nobody wants to write it.\nI'm generally not going to make a lot of the appointments that would normally be--because you don't need them. I mean, you look at some of these agencies, how massive they are, and it's totally unnecessary. They have hundreds of thousands of people. And you look at--so the appointments, I've made some great appointments. You take a look at the appointments we've made. But two things that nobody mentions that I think are very important: judges. I have many, many judges in the pipeline. Already we've had approved a number. Federal judges. I'm not just talking about Justice Gorsuch, Supreme Court, I'm talking about many federal judges. And I will have approximately 145 federal judges. I'm getting praised--right, I mean, are you disputing that? It's approximately 145. That doesn't include the court-of-appeals judges, which will be about 17. So we've had a tremendous amount of judges. Many are in the pipeline, and we're being praised for the quality of the people we're putting on the court system. That's a very big factor. In addition, so if you look already in nine months, numerous judges have already been approved. Many are in the pipeline. Others are now, as we speak, being chosen. And our system is working very, very well. We will have made a stamp on the court system the likes of which I don't think anybody has ever been able to do before, because we have so many.\nD'Vorkin:Who do you call, who do you pick up the phone and call and say, \"I need to talk. I have a question.\"\nWell, I have friendships, I have relationships. Largely the relationship is where I am--in other words, now it's very much of a Washington relationship. I deal with people here. It's a very fair question. I do like to call friends. I don't have much time, believe it or not. I am definitely a working president. I come in early. I start very early. Today I've already spoken to the head of France and the head of other countries. And you know, I mean, this is very much of a, in fact I have my actual working desk inside. This looks very nice, don't let that fool you. But more family, I think, than anything else. Plus I have some very good friendships in business. And I do like to get opinions. I am somebody that very much accepts opinions from people that I know understand what's going on in the world.\nD'Vorkin:Is it at times lonely?\nIt's a lonely position, because the decisions are so grave, so big. If it's a big--like, if you buy airplanes, it's tens of billions of dollars. It's not like you're buying a plane. It's hundreds of billions of dollars. But that's not--the decision I made on Syria, for example, going in and firing 59 rockets, missiles, into Syria. When I had to give the go-ahead for that, that's a very hard decision to make. You don't know. Every one of them hit their target with incredible technology--Tomahawks in that case, but incredible technology. And I was actually sitting with the president of China at the time, having dessert in Florida, at Mar-a-Lago. But you know those decisions are tough decisions. It's lonely. And you have to make them yourself. And the military is--we have the greatest military. And by the way, our military is getting so much stronger, so much better. And rapidly. But I will tell you, you make those decisions all by yourself.\nD'Vorkin:Did business prepare you for that decision?\nNo, nothing prepares you for that. Nothing prepares you for-- when you send missiles, that means people are going to die. And nothing really prepares you for that.\nThere's not that much room left. There's not that much room left. Look, this should have been taken care of by four or five previous administrations. It certainly should have been taken care of over the last eight years. And every year makes it a more difficult situation. And right now, I mean President Obama told me--sitting right there, the two of us. He said that the previous--in the meeting we had prior to my coming into the White House--he said that was his toughest decision. But I said, but you didn't make a decision, because you didn't do anything. You let it go on. I just, I feel strongly you cannot allow him to have nuclear weapons.\nHe was wasting his time.\nWell, I'm not undermining. I think I'm actually strengthening authority. But in the case of North Korea, they have been talking for 25 years. Obviously, that doesn't work.\nYes.\nNo.\nWell, TPP was not a signed deal. It would have been a disaster. It would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA, which is a disaster. I inherited the NAFTA. It's a disaster for this country.\nNo. You take a look at your car manufacturing plants, go down to Mexico.\nFive more minutes. If you take a look at your car manufacturing plants, Randall, NAFTA has been a disaster for manufacturing in this country. We have lost so much of our car business to Mexico. NAFTA is a disaster as a deal. Now we're renegotiating it. I happen to think that NAFTA will have to be terminated if we're going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can't negotiate a good deal. It's a terrible deal for our country. It's been a terrible deal. It was a mistake. TPP would have been a large-scale version of NAFTA. It would have been a disaster. It's a great honor to have--I consider that a great accomplishment, stopping that. And there are many people that agree with me. I like bilateral deals.\nWe would have gone into a hornet's nest. No, no, but you can have it this way and do much more business. And if it doesn't work out with a country, you give them a 30-day notice, and you either renegotiate or not. But TPP would have been a disaster for the country. Well, let's look at it differently. I also took things and made them happen that weren't going to happen, like the big pipeline deals. Those were deals that were not going to happen--48,000 jobs. Those were deals that were not going to happen that I made happen, and I made them happen immediately.\nFor me, it's America first. We've been doing that so long that we owe $20 trillion, okay? It's America first. We have to build up our country. I got elected. It's called Make America Great Again. We have debt. We have deals going. I mean, the deal we made, as an example, the trade deal we made with South Korea, is a terrible deal. We're renegotiating it. It's a terrible deal, and we're renegotiating that deal right now. At the same time, we're helping them militarily. But they have to treat us fairly, and other countries have to treat us fairly. As an example, we defend Saudi Arabia. I'm very good friends with many of the people in Saudi Arabia, including the king. I have great respect. Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country. Why are we defending them, and not being properly taken care of economically? It doesn't make sense. Nobody ever thought of it. There are many countries that are extremely wealthy that we defend. Why are we defending them, and spending money to defend them, and they're not reimbursing us properly and fully? And I'm doing that. At the same time, we will have better relationships than we have right now. You know, I have very good relationships with the leaders of countries.\nWell, they just announced that there was no vote change, number one.\nThey just said there was no change in vote. They just said that. They also just said that there has been absolutely no collusion. They just said that. Yesterday. Two days ago. Senate. There has been no collusion. I didn't speak to Russians. Everyone knows that that was just a statement put out by the Democrats so that they could have an excuse for losing an election that in theory they should have won because it's very easy for the Democrats to win the electoral college. And not only didn't they win, it was 306 to--what was it?--223, if you could get the right number. It was 306 to 223. That was an excuse for the Democrats not winning the election. [Ed. Note: Clinton received 232 electoral votes.]\nIt would bother me greatly if that's the case. It would bother me greatly. And I look forward to seeing what the final reports are. And hopefully they'll come out soon, so if there are suggestions, we can do those suggestions prior to the '18 election. But it has been taking so long, all of the various studies and reports, but I would like to see what everybody comes up with, so that we can, if there's something to do with respect to the '18 elections, which are right around the corner, we'll have time to do it. Don't forget, we have those elections now in about a year. There's not that much time. So I would like to see that, because I don't want Russia messing with our elections, nor do I want anybody or any other country messing with our elections, that's for sure.\nWell, I've gotten very high marks for the hurricanes. And I think I really feel that the reason is because of what I've done, to a certain extent, in business. We mobilized. I put some excellent people in charge of FEMA. We have some excellent people that I worked with. We had fast mobilization. We had mobilization before the hurricanes even hit, which other people didn't do. You probably noticed that in terms of signing emergency orders, they were signed immediately as opposed to waiting for long, long periods of time, and then, by that time, it was too late. And you had catastrophes that had lasting damage. I think, yeah, I think that there is a natural business instinct for that. And we worked closely with the governors, and we've had some really great governors to work with. Governor of Texas. The governor of Florida. We have really had some, I think, great relationships, but the mobilization went very, very well. And you look at what's going on in Texas. They're rebuilding. They're going to be back very soon. Florida is going to be back, way ahead of schedule. I've done a very good job in Puerto Rico--haven't been given the same kind of credit, but if you speak to the governor of Puerto Rico and other representatives, you'll see that they were thrilled. Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands--people don't even talk about it, but the governor of the Virgin Islands, Governor Mapp, gave us an A+. He said the job we've done has been incredible. He said that yesterday, very officially. Governor Mapp. Kenneth Mapp, terrific guy. But yeah, we've gotten very high marks for that. Then we had the tragedy in Las Vegas, which is a whole different thing. That was a very, very sad occurrence. I was there. I was in the hospitals. I met some incredible people, though horribly wounded. They were horribly wounded. But it, in one sense, taught me how great our country is, the fact that they can get back on their feet so quickly\nD'Vorkin:Thank you.\nYeah. We have some great--the people of this country are just great. I mean, more than anything else, all of the hurricanes, the Las Vegas tragedy, it teaches me how great the people of our country are.\nOh, we're going to look at that very closely. This has just come up. And we're going to take a look at that very closely.\nI have about 330 million bosses.\nIt doesn't change, because all I want to do is the right thing. You'll see that I'll make decisions that aren't politically popular, but they're the right thing to do. So I do have all 330 million bosses, but it doesn't matter, because I'm going to do the right thing. I think that's another thing that maybe you'll do more as a businessperson than you would as a politician. A politician is going to do the politically correct thing. I'm going to do the right thing for the country.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-forbes-magazine-editor-randall-lane-and-chief-product-officer-lewis-dvorkin"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Senate Majority Leader A. Mitchell McConnell", "Date": "2017-10-16", "Text": "Thank you very much. I just want to say that we just spent quite a bit of time inside with the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, who has been a friend of mine for a long time, long before my world of politics, early into his world of politics, I think. [Laughter] But we've been friends for a long time. We are probably now, despite what we read, we're probably now—I think, at least as far as I'm concerned—closer than ever before. And the relationship is very good.\nWe're fighting for the same thing. We're fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our Nation. We're fighting for tax reform as part of that. We are getting close to health care. It will come up in the early to mid-part of next year. We're going to have a vote; I think we already have the votes. We feel confident we have the votes. You pretty much know what the plan is.\nI believe Republicans and Democrats are, as we speak, working together very hard, right now—working together to do an intermediate plan, a short-term plan, because Obamacare is a disaster. The rates have gone up. The premiums have gone up. The deductibles have gone through the roof. I mean, it's terrible. If you look at the deductibles, unless you really have a problem, you're not going to be able to use them.\nSo we have been working together long and hard. We think we're in good shape for the budget, we hope. And we hope to be in good shape with, again, the largest tax cuts ever passed in this country. It's going to spur business. You look at other countries, what they've done, and we're competing with other countries. When China is at 15 percent, when I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their corporate rates down to 8 percent from 12. But you have other countries also reducing. We can't be at 35 percent and think we're going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs. So we worked on that.\nI was very honored to see a man that I've had a lot of respect for, James Lee Witt, of the Clinton administration—the head of FEMA. He gave us an A-plus; I just see—it just came out. And I've always had respect for him. He gave us—he's the FEMA director of the Clinton administration—gave us an A-plus for how we responded to the hurricane aftermath, all of the hurricanes. And that includes Puerto Rico.\nSo I just want to thank Mr. Witt, wherever you may be now, wherever you may be listening. I just want to say, I really much appreciate it. Because that took it out of politics—out of the world of politics, in that he was with the Clinton administration and I'm sure remains loyal to the Clinton administration. I hope he does.\nSo just to finish off, my relationship with this gentleman is outstanding, has been outstanding. We are working very hard to get the tax cuts. We will continue to work hard to get the health care completed. I'm going to be surprising some people with an economic development bill later on, but I haven't even told Mitch, because I want to focus on tax cuts and some other things right now.\nOne of the unspoken elements that we discussed at lunch—and it just is not talked about—yes, we got a great Justice—Justice Gorsuch—into the United States Supreme Court. He is going to be outstanding, hopefully, for many, many years. But something that people aren't talking about is how many judges we've had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges. We have—tremendous—right now under review; the Democrats are holding them up beyond anything—beyond comprehension, they're holding them up.\nI mean, frankly, they have terrible, terrible policy—terrible policy—and perhaps they're not even good politicians, but they are good at obstruction. So I looked at some of these numbers, between the judges—and I want to say that we will set records in terms of the number of judges.\nAnd if you read the Wall Street Journal, I have to give them a little bit of a—a person, a writer, I won't mention names—but you can see who has really been a really fair person—wrote an article or wrote an editorial, in a sense, saying how well we're doing with judges and appointments. I think it's one of the big unsung things of this administration, in addition to the fact that we have had a lot of legislation passed on the VA and lots of other things.\nBut the judge story is an untold story. Nobody wants to talk about it. But when you think about it, Mitch and I were saying, that has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge, but 40 years out. So numerous have been approved. Many, many are in the pipeline. The level of quality is extraordinary.\nAnd I just wanted to say that we're working very closely on that also and getting really great reviews from those people and, in many cases, some scholars that have been studying it. There has never been anything like what we've been able to do together with judges.\nSo with that, I'd like to have Mitch say a few words, and if you want to do a little question-and-answer, we can do that also.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nLeader McConnell.Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. I want to underscore what the President said. We have the same agenda. We've been friends and acquaintances for a long time. We talk frequently. We don't give you a readout every time we have a conversation. But frequently we talk on the weekends about the issues that are before us.\nObviously, passing the budget, which enables tax reform and tax reduction comes next, then a supplemental to take adequate care of those who have been harmed by the natural disasters we've been afflicted with lately. And of course, the Senate's unique role—that it seems to me, a lot of people forget—we're in the personnel business. There are 1,200 of the President's nominations subject to confirmation in the Senate. The House is not in the personnel business. We are.\nThe single most significant thing this President has done to change America is the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But it's not just the Supreme Court. There are a lot of vacancies at both the circuit court and district court level, as the President has indicated, young, conservative—and when we say conservative about a judge, what we're talking about here are, the kind of the people the President is appointing to the courts believe that the role of a judge is to try to rule based upon what the law says, not what they hoped the outcome would be.\nAs Justice Scalia used to say, if the judge is not occasionally unhappy with the conclusion he reached, he's not a very good judge. Or as Justice Gorsuch put it down in my State a couple of weeks ago, judges don't wear red, they don't wear blue—they wear black. And those are the kind of people the President is sending up to the Senate to be confirmed. Many of them, as he pointed out, younger, that will be on the bench for a long time and have a great deal to do with what kind of country we're going to have far into the future.\nLegislatively, obviously the top priority is tax reduction. And I think what the President and I would both like to say to you today, contrary to what some of you may have reported: We are together totally on this agenda to move America forward.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News].\nWell, I would like to see it be done this year, John.\nLeader McConnell. I would too.\nI would like very much to see it be done this year. So we won't go a step further. If we get it done, that's a great achievement.\nBut don't forget it took years for the Reagan administration to get taxes done. I've been here for 9 months, a little more than 9 months. I can say the same thing for health care. If you look at Obama—first of all, you look at Clinton, they weren't able to get it done. You look at other administrations, they weren't able to get it done. President Obama, after a long period of time, was able to finally push it through, but pushed through something that's now failed—it's really failing badly. But again, we're meeting—Democrat, Republican are meeting right now, and right now they're working on something very special.\nLeader McConnell. Yes, let me——\n——of getting the taxes done, hopefully, fairly long before the end of the year. That's what we'd like to see.\nGo ahead.\nLeader McConnell.Could I just add? Yes, let me just—let me just add to what the President said. The goal is to get it done this calendar year. But it is important to remember that Obama signed Obamacare in March of year 2. Obama signed Dodd-Frank in July of year 2. We're going to get this job done, and the goal is to get it done by the end of the year.\nAnd just to finish up for Mitch—and we're 9 months, right? So—[laughter].\nLeader McConnell. Yes.\nSo we could have a long way to go, but that's okay.\nThank you.\nWell, let's go to the second part of your question, with Mitch. Again, we've been doing health care for, really, 7 months, and probably 6 months, if you think about it, because we started in probably a total of 6 months. Others were 2½ years and much more than that. Others were 8 years, and they didn't get it passed. This man is going to get it done, okay? And I think get it done long before anybody else, and I think it's going to be a great health care.\nAs far as Tom Marino, so he was a very early supporter of mine, the great State of Pennsylvania. He's a great guy. I did see the report. We're going to look into the report, and we're going to take it very seriously. Because we're going to have a major announcement, probably next week, on the drug crisis and on the opioid massive problem. And I want to get that absolutely right. This country—and frankly, the world—has a drug problem. The world has a drug problem. But we have it, and we're going to do something about it.\nSo I'm going to have a major announcement on that problem next week. We're going to be looking into Tom.\nWell, I have a very good relationship, as you know, with Steve Bannon. Steve has been a friend of mine for a long time. I like Steve a lot. Steve is doing what Steve thinks is the right thing. Some of the people that he may be looking at, I'm going to see if we talk him out of that, because, frankly, they're great people.\nWhat Mitch will tell you is that maybe, with the exception of a few—and that is a very small few—I have a fantastic relationship with the people in the Senate and with the people in Congress. I mean, I have a—with our House of Representatives. I have a great relationship with political people. If you read the papers, you think, I'm, like, on one island and they're, like, on the other. Well, it's not the way it is.\nWe have a fantastic relationship. I'm friends with most of them, I can say. And I don't think anybody could have much of a higher percentage. But I'm friends with most of them. I like and respect most of them, and I think they like and respect me.\nJust so you understand, the Republican Party is very, very unified. When we get things approved, we have to go through hell because we have no Democrat support, we have nobody. We don't have a vote from the Democrats. As an example, massive tax cuts, we may not get any Democrat votes. Now, we also may get three of four, but we may get no—for massive tax cuts. We're the highest taxed country in the world, and yet we may get no Democrat support. And that's because they're obstructionists, and they just basically want us to do badly, but that's not going to happen.\nYes, go ahead.\nOffice of National Drug Control Policy Director-Designate Thomas A. Marino/Opioid Crisis\nRight.\nYes.\nWe're going to look at that very closely.\nWell, he's a good man. I have not spoken to him, but I will speak to him, and I'll make that determination. And if I think it's——\nI think—if I think it's 1 percent negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change, yes.\nWait, one second. Yes.\nWe are going to be doing that next week. By the way, you know that's a big step. By the way, people have no understanding of what you just said. That is a very, very big statement. It's a very important step. And to get to that step, a lot of work has to be done, and it's time-consuming work. We're going to be doing it next week, okay?\nYes.\nExactly right.\nSo the insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare, an absolute fortune. As you know, what I did with the cuts at the end, which were all going—you know, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars a month going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I'm very happy with what I did.\nAnd because of that, people are talking now. Democrats are talking to the Republicans for a short-term taking care of, what we will call, health care so that people can have good health care without big spikes. You would have had massive spikes—you already have. I mean, every year the massive spikes to Obamacare have been ridiculous.\nAs far as—and I didn't speak to Mitch about this today, but a priority of mine—and you know that this is coming up—will be the cost of prescription drugs. We are going to get the costs way down, way down, and those drugs companies—so you have the insurance companies, in the one case; in the other case—actually, with regard to both, you have the drug companies.\nThey contribute massive amounts of money to political people. I don't know, Mitch, maybe even to you. [Laughter] But I have to tell you, they contribute massive amounts of money. Me, I'm not interested in their money. I don't need their money. I will tell you, you have prescription drugs—you go to England, you go to various places, Canada—you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything, is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the United States.\nWe are going to get drug prices—prescription drug prices—way down, because the world has taken advantage of us. The world has taken advantage of us when that happens, so that's going to be very important.\nYes.Q.Now that you've cut off these payments, are you going to ensure that those people will still get help from the Federal Government to pay that insurance?\nWell, that's what we're looking to do, Joe [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. We want to get it down so that people can have affordable health care. Look, you look at some States—116 percent up. In Alaska, over 200 percent up. In other States, 50 percent, 70 percent up, and those are some of the States that are doing better. Obamacare is a wreck, it's a mess, it's destroying lives. We want to get it in those States—the States that I did so well in—but also in States that I didn't win.\nI want to get health care that's much more affordable and much better health care, and that's what we're doing.\nGo ahead, tax reform.\nYes.\nSure.\nSo we are doing minor adjustments. We want to make sure that the middle class is the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts and tax reform. And that's, I'm sure, what Mitch meant also, because people get it confused.\nWe are doing massive tax cuts. We're also doing simplification and reform. Simplification, where, literally, if we can do it on page; now, in some cases, it may be two pages. But we're doing major simplification. We're bringing the categories down from—if you include zero, because there are zero—we're bringing it from eight to four. That's a big, big simplification, just that alone.\nBut we are doing a—the massive cuts. And I will say this: Wherever I've been, this has been so popular with the people. Now we have to get a couple of additional people to raise their hands.\nI've written them personal letters. They've been sent, or they're going out tonight, but they were written during the weekend. I will, at some point during the period of time, call the parents and the families—because I have done that, traditionally. I felt very, very badly about that. I always feel badly. It's the toughest—the toughest calls I have to make are the calls where this happens, soldiers are killed. It's a very difficult thing. Now, it gets to a point where, you know, you make four or five of them in one day—it's a very, very tough day. For me, that's by far the toughest.\nSo, the traditional way—if you look at President Obama and other Presidents, most of them didn't make calls, a lot of them didn't make calls. I like to call when it's appropriate, when I think I'm able to do it. They have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nSo, generally, I would say that I like to call. I'm going to be calling them. I want a little time to pass. I'm going to be calling them. I have—as you know, since I've been President, I have. But in addition, I actually wrote letters individually to the soldiers we're talking about, and they're going to be going out either today or tomorrow.\nI do. I think Cuba knew about it, sure. I do believe Cuba is responsible. I do believe that. And it's a very unusual attack, as you know, but I do believe Cuba is responsible, yes.\nWell, I'm going to be meeting with Roy sometime next week, and we're going to talk to him about a lot of different things. But I'll be meeting with him.\nHe ran a very strong race. The people of Alabama, who I like very much and they like me very much, but they like Roy. And we'll be talking to him, and I can report to you then. Okay?\nGo ahead.\nI mean, we can talk blue slips, but my attitude is, I just want really capable people going to the courts.\nPeter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].\nWell, let me just explain what's different. We have nominations pending right now, and we have 182 approved—if you look at this: the number that he had approved was 65 percent and 70 percent, and we have 39 percent. They're holding up every single nomination.\nSchumer and the group are holding up every single nomination. They are obstructing. They're doing—it's really what—I'm telling you, they're not good politicians, but they're very good at obstruction.\nThey are holding up every single nomination, and I will tell you, Peter, it's not right. It's really not right. They'll bring them right out to the end, that last minute. What they're doing is unfair.\nSo you look at even Bush, you look at Obama, you look at Clinton, and you look at Bush original, you have 389 versus 182—these are approvals. You look at Clinton, 357 versus 182. You look at President Obama, 364 versus 182. These are nominations approved, and what they're doing to us—we have unbelievable people, and they're waiting to be approved. They've been waiting for a long period of time.\nNow, I do believe that Mitch is going to start pushing them very hard, and he can do that, and he wants to do that. He also wants to get the judicial nominations through, and he wants to get them through fast too.\nGo ahead, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Okay. Go ahead, John.\nThe President's Relations With Democratic Congressional Leaders/Bipartisanship/The President's Legislative AgendaQ.Can I just follow on that, if I could, please? You seemed to have a budding spirit of cooperation with the Senate Minority Leader and the House Minority Leader when it came to the budget, when it came to this idea of finding a fix for DACA. But every proposal that you have floated since then, they have very critically rejected.\nIt's true.\nWell, I hope to have a relationship. If we don't, we don't. I mean, we have races coming up in, as you know, in a year from now. I think we're going to probably do very well. I can say this: If we get taxes approved, we're going to do unbelievably well.\nMany of the Senators are running in States that I won by massive amounts—20, over 20 percent, sometimes 30 percent; I guess in one or two cases, by over 40 percent over the Democrat.\nWell, we're going to let you know that at—I would like to give you that answer in about 7 years from now, is that okay? Meaning, one plus seven.\nI hope to—John, I hope to be able to because I like the concept of bipartisan. But right now they are doing nothing but obstructing. And really, if you think about it, they're against major tax cuts that's going to make our country stronger and more competitive. That's a hard thing to win an election on, and I believe that some Democrats will be voting for us when it comes to the tax cuts.\nI'm going to be proposing an economic development bill in the not-too-distant future. I want to get tax cuts, obviously, done first; maybe even the health care. But I think somewhere in between or shortly thereafter, I'm going to be developing an economic development bill that will put us so far ahead of other countries you will not even believe it. That will be very important.\nAnd a lot of praise.\nWell, we're very opposite in terms of incentives and incentives for jobs and other things. And if you look at what's happened, we just hit a new—a new high today again in the stock market. We've picked up, Mitch, it's as of this moment, $5.2 trillion in stock market value. We have the lowest unemployment rate in—I believe it's almost 17 years. We're doing well.\nWe're going to be doing immigration work that's going to be outstanding, and we're going to have people coming into our country based, hopefully, on a merit system, not just coming in randomly. But they're going to be coming in based on a merit system where they can help us. Because I have companies moving into this country—you saw what happened with the automobile industry last week with five major plants. We have companies pouring back into this country for the first time in anybody's memory. We are actually going to be, fairly soon, at a point where we're going to need workers. Our country is going to do so well. But the tax cuts are going to be a major, major part of it.\nWell, not too many, I must say. It's the opposite side of the spectrum.\nAll right, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News]. Go ahead, Peter.\nI don't know if he did. No, no, no.\nI was told that he didn't often. And a lot of Presidents don't; they write letters. I do——\nExcuse me, Peter. I do a combination of both. Sometimes—it's a very difficult thing to do, but I do a combination of both. President Obama, I think, probably did sometimes, and maybe sometimes, he didn't. I don't know. That's what I was told. All I can do—all I can do is ask my generals. Other Presidents did not call. They'd write letters. And some Presidents didn't do anything.\nBut I like the combination of—I like, when I can, the combination of a call and also a letter.\n[At this point, many reporters began asking questions at once.]\nAll right, one at a time. Go ahead.\nWell, I'd like to see it end. Look, the whole Russian thing was an excuse——Q.Would you agree to an interview with the Special Counsel or the legal team who is advising him?\nExcuse me, excuse me. The whole Russia thing was an excuse for the Democrats losing the election, and it turns out to be just one excuse. I mean, today Hillary blamed Nigel Farage. That one came out of nowhere. So that was just an excuse for the Democrats losing an election that, frankly, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. They should always be able to win in the electoral college, but they were unable to do it.\nSo there has been absolutely no collusion. It's been stated that they have no collusion. They ought to get to the end of it, because I think the American public is sick of it.\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nWell, I can't comment on Bowe Bergdahl because he's—as you know, they're—I guess he's doing something today, as we know. And he's also—they're setting up sentencing, so I'm not going to comment on him. But I think people have heard my comments in the past.\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, they should be able to do something. But we need very stronger border security, and we do want the wall.\nGo ahead.\nNo, they haven't. In fact, I spoke to Governor Brown. We had a great conversation. We have FEMA there. And as you know, James Lee Witt gave us an A-plus, and I think if he didn't include the fires, he would include the fires also. We have FEMA there. We have military there. We have first responders there. It's a tragic situation. But we're working very closely with the representatives from California, and we're doing a good job.\nGo ahead, back. Yes, go ahead, back.\nSexual Harassment Allegations Against the PresidentQ.Mr. President, in the wake of an avalanche of allegations made against Harvey Weinstein, your campaign is being subpoenaed for any documents relating to sexual harassment allegations made against you. Do you have any response to that?\nAll I can say is it's totally fake news. It's just fake. It's fake. It's made-up stuff, and it's disgraceful what happens. But that's happens in the world of politics.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].\nOur country needs a wall. Mexico, you see what's happening there. You see what just happened yesterday with one of their big political leaders. Mexico is not doing particularly well when it comes to the kind of thing that we have great interest in. Drugs are pouring across our border. We're stopping it, but we need a wall to really stop it. We need a wall in this country. You know it. I know it. Everybody knows it. We have to have a wall, so that's going to be part of it.\nOh, I think—well, that's according to the Clinton administration's head of FEMA, it's been outstanding.\nPuerto Rico is very tough because of the fact it's an island. But it's also tough because, as you know, it was in very poor shape before the hurricanes ever hit. Their electrical grid was destroyed before the hurricanes got there. It was in very bad shape, was not working, was in bankruptcy, owed $9 billion. And then, on top of that, the hurricane came.\nNow, you're going to have to build a whole new electrical plant system. We're not talking about generators. We moved—Puerto Rico now has more generators, I believe, than any place in the world. There are generators all over the place. The fact is, their electrical system was in horrible shape before and even worse shape after.\nSo we are working right now—as you know, relief funds were just approved and are in the process of being approved by Congress. And that includes Texas, by the way. That includes Florida. And it also includes Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, et cetera. But it was in really bad shape before. We have done—I will say this, we have done——\nWell, I'll let Mitch. You want to talk about that, Mitch?\nLeader McConnell.Was the question about the 20-week——\nGo ahead.\nWell, I'll be going, as you know, to South Korea, to China, to Japan, to Vietnam for the summit. We have a big economic summit there. I may be going to the Philippines also. We've been invited. We've been invited to the Philippines, so I may be going to the Philippines. And I look forward to all of them. We haven't set the details as of this moment.\nWe'll take a look at that. I didn't hear in terms of provoking, but we will certainly take a look at that.\nDepartment of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/Iraq\nWe don't like the fact that they're clashing. We're not taking sides, but we don't like the fact that they're clashing.\nWe—well, let me tell you, we've had for many years a very good relationship with the Kurds, as you know. And we've also been on the side of Iraq, even though we should have never been in there in the first place. We should never have been there. But we're not taking sides in that battle.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News].\nOh, I hope Hillary runs. Is she going to run? I hope. Hillary, please run again.\nGo ahead. [Laughter]\nI think she's wrong. Look, when they take a knee—there's plenty of time to do knees, and there's plenty of time to do lots of other things.\nBut when you take a knee—well, that's why she lost the election. I mean, honestly, it's that thinking, that is the reason she lost the election. When you go down and take a knee or any other way, you're sitting essentially for our great national anthem, you're disrespecting our flag and you're disrespecting our country. And the NFL should have suspended some of these players for one game—not fire them—suspended them for one game. And then, if they did it again, it could have been two games and three games and then for the season. You wouldn't have people disrespecting our country right now.\nAnd if Hillary Clinton actually made the statement that, in a form, sitting down during the playing of our great national anthem is not disrespectful, then I fully understand why she didn't win. I know—I mean look, there are a lot of reasons that she didn't win, including the fact that she was not good at what she did.\nBut I will tell you that is something that I had just heard about.Q. Sir——\nAnd I think that her statement in itself is very disrespectful to our country.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much.\nIt is very disrespectful to our country when they take a knee during our national anthem. It is very——\nJust hear it, hear it. It is very disrespectful to our country when they take a knee during the national anthem, number one. Number two, the people of our country are very angry at the NFL. All you have to do is look at their ratings and look at their stadiums. You see empty seats where you never saw them before. A lot of people are very angry at it. It is highly disrespectful. They shouldn't do it.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\nI don't think so.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-senate-majority-leader-mitchell-mcconnell"}
{"Title": "Interview With Mike Gallagher of the Salem Radio Network", "Date": "2017-10-17", "Text": "That's true, that's true.\nI'm very good. Thank you, Mike. Thank you.\nIt is fake news, and it's really disgraceful what they can say. Between Rush and you and Sean Hannity, and so many others, we have so many friends in talk radio. Some people say talk radio won me the election, but I say it certainly helped. [Laughter]\nAnd you've been great, Mike, and I appreciate it very much.\nNo, we do a lot talk radio, and we really respect it as a medium, no question about it.\nRight, right. That's right. Well, we have a good group of Republicans, we really do. Don't forget, it's three or four people. They let us down. That's all it is. We had—as you know, we had health care. It was done, and then a hand went up and the hand was—it went up in the wrong direction at 2 o'clock in the morning. And everybody was shocked by it.\nAnd whether you call it disgraceful, or whatever you want to call it—you can call it what you will. But in all fairness to the Republicans, you have some great people that are Republican Senators. And you have some great Congress men and women that I know and like so much. But I will tell you, we were very, very disappointed with health care.\nBut here's the good news: We're going to get it. We have the votes. We're going to get it. I mean, now we have a problem with Thad Cochran is not feeling well. You know that. He's quite sick, quite ill, and some other things.\nBut we're going to get it. We're going to get taxes. We're going to get the health care reform. I'm going to get economic development, which I don't even talk about. We're going to get a tremendous infrastructure bill. But I'm waiting to get these two.\nNo, I figure it out. I know exactly what we're doing, and I have a great plan. We were upset by one vote in health care, as we said. We're going to get it. You know, I'll vote it five times. I don't care, I don't care.\nYou know, how somebody can vote for 7 years, repeal and replace, repeal and replace, when it didn't mean anything. Now you have a President that's actually going to sign it. It didn't mean—because you had somebody that wasn't going to sign it. Plus, they didn't even have the Senate in a certain sense. So they'd always vote \"repeal and replace.\" And then, when they finally have it so they can get it, you have the House, and you just about have the Senate, and then one vote knocks it out. It's very, very—it's a disgrace.\nI've got to do what I have to do. We have to get it done. We have had so much approval. You know, the one thing I will say, and you see it in my poll numbers how high they've been and especially in certain swing States. If you look at Ohio and Pennsylvania, and you look at North Carolina—I was just there—and West Virginia is through the roof because you see what we've done on coal; we're putting coal miners back to work, and West Virginia is doing really well. So many different States, and they see—they get it. They get—and maybe also because of talk radio because Fox treats me very well.\nBut I'll tell you, CNN is fake news. MSNBC and NBC are terrible. They're probably as bad or worse than CNN.\nThey're really despicable.\nWell, think of this: We have the Accountability Act at the VA. Nobody could get it for 40 years. For 40 years they couldn't get it. And I have to say, respectfully, it was the unions, it was the civil servants, it was—you know, civil service. And all of them—and everyone said you could never get it. I got it through.\nSo now, if somebody does a horrible job for the veterans, if they're sadistic, which happens, if they're lazy and slow and don't show up, we can actually fire them. Before, you couldn't fire them. So now they pay a consequence. We passed a lot of things for the veterans. We passed a lot of things for economic development. And for the EPA—look at what we're doing with EPA.\nSo we're doing great. And of course, we have Judge Gorsuch, as you know. Justice Gorsuch is great.\nAnd people don't even talk about it. In all fairness, the Wall Street Journal wrote a fantastic article the other day about how well we're doing with Federal—there will never have been an impact like we're going to have with Federal judges. I think we have 145 of them, not including Court of Appeals, where we have 17.\nIt will change the whole Court of Appeals.\nNow, they're delaying us, they're obstructing, the Democrats. They're taking our picks, they're taking my nominations, and they're just taking forever. But we're getting people——\nThe New York Times, the Washington Post are so inaccurate, so inaccurate. I mean, they will take a good event and make it bad. They will take something that really is positive. I'm going to just speak—it's just the way it is. And actually, people admit it. And actually, the New York Times almost admits it. They say, we don't even care.\nThey wrote. They wrote.\nAnd it continues. And it continues.\nIt's an amazing phenomenon.\nYou know what gets to me—what's incredible to me is, I would say, I watch the news on me, and I would say nobody, nobody would vote for Trump. [Laughter] And then, I see polls come out. We had one come out today, Rasmussen, 46 or 47 [percent; White House correction.]. And you know, at 47 you can't lose. That's a very high number. In fact, Obama got out at 46 percent, I guess, right? So he was very popular, if you call that popular. I don't know why he was popular, but I guess he was popular.\nBut we're doing—we're undoing a lot of the damage that he did. And let's face it, Mike, I inherited a mess, whether you look at North Korea, whether you look at the Middle East, whether you look at so many different things. You look at what the environmental things that they've done—have done to some of our companies. It's just terrible. Getting out of the Paris accord was a great thing. That was going to cost us a fortune. It was going to cost us millions of jobs. It was a disaster.\nAnd by the way, I could get back in anytime I wanted to at a much better deal. But I'm not particularly anxious.\nGo ahead.\nAnd you know Thad is—you know, probably won't be able to be here. So that's very bad. That's almost like a \"no\" vote, when I think about it. I do believe Rand Paul is going to come onboard.\nI do believe he's coming to come through. I hope he's going to come through. And you know, I've gotten along very well with him. Whenever I really needed him, he's been there for me, I must tell you. He was there for me in the first health care vote—two of them. And frankly, he liked the second health care better, meaning the one that I didn't ask him for the vote because I could see we weren't going to get there.\nBut now we are there. And I think Rand will be there. And let's see what happens, but we have the votes coming up, starting on Thursday. Budget is phase one, and the vote is phase two. And if the Republicans don't do it, it's—it would be disgraceful to them.\nThank you, Mike.\nYou have been my friend from the beginning, and you notice, I walked over here very quickly, didn't I?\nHe's not too happy. [Laughter]\nThat's okay. Brian's a great guy. They're all great.\nYou've been my friend. I thank you very much.\nAnd we're going to get it there. We're going to lower those taxes. We're going to make ourselves competitive again. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We will turn it around fast too. You'll see.\nThank you, Mike.Mr. Gallagher. Thanks, Mr. President. Keep fighting the good fight.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-mike-gallagher-the-salem-radio-network"}
{"Title": "Interview With Brian Kilmeade of Fox News Radio", "Date": "2017-10-17", "Text": "This is radio, Brian, right? Radio.\nIt's supposed to be on radio. Now I saw Brian taking advantage of the situation. That's all right.\nI feel good.\nI feel good.\nWell, it's very important. I mean, we need the budget, we need the passage. We have Thad Cochran, as you know, is not feeling so great. And he may not be able to vote. We don't know what John McCain is going to do. We have a couple of others that maybe could disappoint us, but maybe they won't.\nThey've been talking about all sorts of things for so long; now they have a President that's really willing to sign what we have to sign. But I think we're going to be good, and I think we're going to be good for taxes. And it's, you know, very close, because we have no support from the Democrats. They're obstructionists; all they want to do is obstruct. So we have 48 votes against us. So we literally can't lose more than two votes, which is a really tough situation.\nOn the budget. Well, we have phase one and phase two. Phase one, we have to think only—I'm only right now thinking about the budget. Phase two is tax, because that will be next week, but phase one is the budget. And if we get the budget, I think we'll be in good shape to get the tax, but we have to get the budget.\nWell, we'll be talking to Joe. I think it's hard for Joe to vote against tax cuts. We're talking about massive tax cuts——Mr. Kilmeade.In West Virginia.\n——in West Virginia. And I've turned West Virginia around, because of what I've done environmentally and with coal. And I don't know if you saw, but West Virginia is second to Texas in percentage increase of GDP. And everyone is saying, \"I can't believe it,\" because they were having such problems.\nBut I think it's very hard for Joe, I think it's very hard for other people to vote—especially where I'm very popular in their States and they're coming up for election—to vote against the largest tax cut in the history of our country. People need their money, where their Government is taking too much money. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We need the tax cuts.\nRight, right.\nSo small business is coming way down. And if you talk about the zero—you know, I said you've got to put the zero in. They were saying we have three brackets. I said, I know you like to say we only have three brackets as opposed to seven or eight, but you've got to put the zero in; that's a bracket.\nSo I said, make it four. And the Democrats, Schumer and all, were using that, and they were using it as bait. Now they can't use it anymore, because where they're paying a much higher rate—or are paying a very high rate—right now a lot of people are going to pay zero. Then, we go to a 12 percent, as an example—it comes down from 15, but it really comes down from much higher than that.\nSo it's a great tax cut for the middle class, but much—hey, look, even the middle class will say it's an unbelievable tax cut for business, which is going to employ people, and the biggest beneficiary will be the middle class.\nTax Reform/Senator Randal H. Paul\nI think he's coming with us.\nI think Rand—I've had a great relationship with Rand Paul, and I think he's going to be with us. I think in the end he's going to be with us. I hope John McCain is going to be with us; we just don't know yet. We have a couple of votes. And of course, Thad is in a position where it's maybe impossible for him to be here, which is a big—you know, that's like a \"no\" vote. That's almost the equivalent of a \"no\" vote. And the problem is we have no Democrats; we have absolutely no Democrat votes.\nYes, we've tried, we've tried. They're in a block. They have 48 votes, and all they want to do is obstruct. Now, I think we'll have Democrats if we get through the budget——you know we have to get through the budget first. If we get through the budget, we have the taxes. I think we're going to have some Democrats, especially in States where I did very well. I mean, I had some States where I won by 30 and 40 points, and that's a big margin. And I think we could have potentially some Democrats in those States for the massive tax cuts that we're talking about.\nI think foreign policy for me has been very strong. I think we did the right thing with Iran. And if you noticed, Iran was respectful yesterday. They were not jumping up and down; they were respectful of what I did. And they might not agree with it, but they were very, very respectful.\nI think that if you look what I did with the payments going to the insurance companies—you know, not going to poor people, they're going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And I brought a list for you——\nLook at these insurance companies. This is since Obamacare started. Anthem—big company, 270 percent increase—270 percent. And that's since ACA. That's Obamacare. So since Obamacare, Humana—420 percent increase; Aetna—470 percent increase; Cigna—480 percent increase.\nThe insurance companies are making a fortune.\nNo, they got a great deal with Obamacare. The one beneficiary—the great beneficiary is for Obamacare, it's not the people—they're getting killed. And looks at what's happening to their premiums. Look at what's happening to the deductibles, how high the deductibles. But look, these are not made up by me. When you have Cigna, Aetna, Humana, Anthem going up 270 [percent],* 420 [percent],* 470 percent, 480 percent, these are insurance companies that went up 480 percent since Obamacare. Is any stock on the stock exchange—has anybody gone up that much?\nThe reason is, is because Obamacare is a rip-off; it's great for the insurance companies. And find out who gave all that money to the Democrats. Take a look at the insurance companies. So the Democrats don't want to hurt the insurance companies. So the money I took away was taken away by—from the insurance companies. And by the way, since I took it down you saw what happened to their stocks.\nYes, I think it helps. I think it helps to make a deal.\nI think if I did not do that, if I didn't hold it back—and I just said, \"We're not going to make that payment.\" If I didn't do that, I don't believe the Democrats would have called.\nNo, it's just that I disagree with Obama on so many things. I mean, I heard—as an example, let's say Hillary Clinton said it was okay for the NFL players to kneel during the anthem. Well, I disagree. Maybe that's why she lost, because that's bad. That's real bad. We have to respect our flag, our country, our anthem. Obama, I disagree with what he does.\nLook, when you look at this—nobody knows this. I just got these numbers. Nobody knows this about the insurance companies. The only beneficiary from Obamacare are the insurance companies. They made a fortune. And that's not—you've never heard that. You've never seen these numbers before.\nWell, he's a fine man. He was a supporter of mine from Pennsylvania, a great State. I won Pennsylvania. And he was a—he's a Congressman from Pennsylvania, very popular. And he told me, look—if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest with insurance companies essentially, but if there's even a perception that he has a conflict of interest, he doesn't want anything to do with it. So whether we have insurance companies or drug companies. And there was a couple of articles having to do with him and drug companies, and I will tell you, he felt compelled—he feels very strong about the opioid problem and the drug problem, which is a worldwide problem, but it's a problem that we have. And Tom Marino said: \"Look, I'll take a pass, I have no choice. I really will take a pass. I want to do it.\" And he was very gracious, I have to say that.\nHe didn't want any—he didn't want to have even the perception of a conflict of interest with drug companies or, frankly, insurance companies.\nWe are more than close, but I won't be able to tell you the name yet because we have to do a little vetting, but we are more than close. And if this person gets approved, it will be a fantastic, a fantastic nomination.\nI only did that because you weren't in the audience.\nIf you were in the audience, I wouldn't have done that.\nWell, there's nothing to clarify, because if you look at my whole—this was again fake news, CNN. I mean, they're just a bunch of fakers. So they asked me that question. And for the most part, to the best of my knowledge, I think I've called every family of somebody that's died, and it's the hardest call to make, and I said it very loud and clear yesterday. The hardest thing for me to do is do that.\nNow, as far as other representatives, I don't know. I mean, you could ask General Kelly. Did he get a call from Obama? You could ask other people. I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters, and I also call.\nNow, sometimes, you know, if you've had a tragic event with—it's very difficult to be able to do that—but I have called, I believe, everybody, but certainly, I'll use the word virtually everybody, where during the last 9 months something has happened to a soldier. I've called virtually everybody. I've gone to Dover. I've seen what takes place at Dover. It's an incredible scene and very, very sad—one of the saddest things you'll ever see.\nBut I really speak for myself; I'm not speaking for other people. I don't know what Bush did, I don't know what Obama did. You could find out easily what President Obama did; all you have to do is ask the military people. But I believe his policy was somewhat different than my policy. I can tell you, my policy is, I've called every one of them. And you have to let a little time go by. You can't just call immediately. But I will be calling—have called and will be calling the parents and the loved ones, wives, et cetera, of the soldiers that recently were killed.\nI love doing it. I'm getting tremendous support. Even in your polls, I'm getting tremendous support, and it's hard to believe I can get support when you have so many phony stories out there, you know, like CNN, like MSNBC, like NBC. NBC is probably worse than CNN. But all I know is, Fox is good. Fox—we love you, Fox.\nYou are fair.\nYou know what? The truth is, you hit me when it's needed, you do. I mean, you do in particular, right? But the fact is, you're fair.\nAll I want is fair. I don't want anything else. I just want fair. And Fox has really been fair, and I appreciate it.\nThank you, man. Take care.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-brian-kilmeade-fox-news-radio"}
{"Title": "Interview With David Webb of Sirius XM Patriot Radio", "Date": "2017-10-17", "Text": "Thank you very much. I appreciate it, David. I appreciate all your support. I mean, you have views similar—I don't even know if we call it support, or if you have views that are similar to——\nThank you.\nOkay, good. Well, the zero bracket is a very substantial bracket. We're bringing it down to zero for many people that are right now paying taxes. And we bring the rate down to 12 percent, which is a much higher rate in the old tax law.\nIn addition to that, we're lowering—a lot of people have said subchapter S and they have flowthroughs, and they have other things, or they have small businesses, not only large business, and those rates are coming way down. So we have—the business rates are coming down, which I think is most important, is businesses are going to be expanding, and jobs are going to be had.\nSo we're going to have a lot of jobs, David, that we didn't have before. And right now we are the highest taxed nation anywhere in the world—you can even say developed or undeveloped. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We have to get this tax cut. It's imperative that we get it.\nEvery country is lowering their taxes but us. We haven't lowered them since Ronald Reagan. I mean, it's been many, many years since taxes went down, and it's a hard—it's hard to believe.\nNow, when you mention the word \"tax reform,\" I must tell you, I don't use that word. I use tax cuts.\nTax Relief/Tax ReformMr. Webb.That's why I brought it up, exactly.\nYou know why? No, no, I use tax cuts, because a lot of people say to me, you know, tax reform, does that mean our taxes are going up? Because they don't know.\nNow, there is a tax reform with it—a very big tax reform—but I talk in terms of tax cuts and reform. It's going to be simplification. We're going to have four brackets, including a zero bracket. We're going to have—you're going to be able to do your taxes literally on one page, no longer hiring H&R Block and spending a fortune on—you know, because nobody understand what they're doing. And it's going to be a really low tax. You're going to have a low tax. You're going to get a substantial tax decrease.\nRight. Well, you know, that was so important to my daughter, Ivanka. I must be honest, she doesn't even talk about anything else. That's all she wants. And she wants that credit, and she wants that to take place. And she said, \"Daddy wants\"—and you know, it's funny, when I speak in speeches, everyone stands and goes wild when I mention the wall——which is happening, by the way; in fact, you see the prototypes being built right now.\nAbsolutely, it's going to happen. And when I mention the Second Amendment, and you know, they want to take away your guns—and nobody talks about with the child and the child tax. Ivanka wants that so badly; she fought so hard for it. And I started to realize that that was something that's so important, and people are loving it.\nSo people with children are going to be able to benefit for the first time in a long time, maybe ever, in terms of taxes.\nRight. That's right. That's right. Thank you.\nWell, it's going to affect everybody. It's going to—actually, we're getting rid of a lot of the big deductions for business, and we're simplifying—we're bringing down the rate, but the rate is actually for rich people, about the same. The big beneficiaries are the middle class; I call it the working people. But the big beneficiaries are the middle class.\nNow, when business expands, a lot of times, rich people own businesses, but those are the people that create the jobs. So our businesses are the highest taxed in the world. If they continue to be taxed like this—this is why jobs are flowing out of the United States.\nNow, with all of that being said, we hit 3 percent—3.2 percent last quarter in GDP. Our unemployment is at a low for almost 17 years. You know, we're doing really well. We're starting to train people out of that big mass—they call it a 100 million people, but let's call it 50 million people, because some of those——\nOkay, you understand what I'm talking about, because, you know, I've always that said that the number of 4-percent unemployment is really not a right number because you have many people, they give up looking for a job because they can't get a job. So you have a lot of people out there that want work.\nAnd as you also see, David, companies are coming here, factories are coming here. Car companies are now rebuilding plants again. This hasn't happened in 20 years. They're leaving, they're going to Mexico, they're going to other places. It's all stopping. And the tax cut will help us. A lot of the people that lost their jobs lost because companies are so highly taxed that they leave the United States, they go to another country—they literally go to another country where the taxes are smaller.\nRight. Well, one thing—we are bringing back probably 3, $3.5 trillion. So we have $3.5 trillion coming back that will just—literally, you couldn't get it back because of the tax system. It didn't really allow the companies—even, it didn't make sense to bring it back—the number was so high and bureaucracy so great. So all of that money, it could be more than $3.5 trillion.\nYou know, for years, we've all been saying, $2.5 trillion. Well, let me tell you, it's grown a lot. And it's a least $3.5 trillion will come back into our country and be put to work on jobs and other things.\nAnd the other thing is, we're bringing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent down to 20 percent, and it's going to have a massive impact.\nYou add them all up, it's a lot more than we owe. You know, we owe $20 trillion; $10 trillion over the last 8 years. So President Obama doubled our debt—think of it—over the last 8 years. Doubled. I mean, if you think for all of the years—in 8 years, we've doubled our debt. But we've added so much value, so much worth, it's been sort of an incredible thing, and we're very happy about it: $5.2 trillion just in the stock market.\nWell, I think one of the most important things I've done—and I'm pretty much, almost 50 percent there—you know, you have statutory problems in time, but it's all happening, and it's happening fast—is regulatory reform, where your land, where your—everything was being taken away. You couldn't do anything. And whether it's EPA or anything else—we want clean air, we want clean water, crystal clean water—but they were making it impossible for people to produce jobs.\nSo what we've done is the biggest cut in regulations in the history of our country, in 9 months. I've done more than any other President—and they've been there a lot longer than 9 months. And we continue to do that. And I want regulation, but it's got to be fair regulation.\nSo that's had a big impact, and I think that's why we hit 3.2 percent in GDP, which has not been hit for many, many years. You know what's been going on. I mean, it's been very sad, what's gone on. So we hit 3.2 last quarter. And this quarter, we'll do fantastically, but we will be affected somewhat by the hurricanes.\nThat's okay.\nI'm used to it, but you've been my friend, and I appreciate it.\nThank you, David.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-david-webb-sirius-xm-patriot-radio"}
{"Title": "Interview With Tony Katz of WIBC Radio in Indianapolis, Indiana", "Date": "2017-10-17", "Text": "I'm fine.\nHi, Tony.\nIt's going good. It's going really good. We're trying to get the budget approved, and then we get the tax cut approved. And you know, know we have to get John McCain to vote for it. And we have to get a couple of others to vote for it. But hopefully, that will take place, and we're going to have the largest tax cut in the history of our country.\nWell, we're going to see what happens. We're not going to have any Democratic support. We may have a few for the tax cuts, but probably not for the budget.\nWe're focused on the budget first. That will take place very shortly. We think we have the votes for the budget. We have to get the budget before we get the taxes. We hope that John McCain is going to be onboard. Rand Paul, I believe, will be onboard. He's, you know, a guy that I like. I've always liked him.\nHe's been there. Yes, sure—he's nice. But we've been talking. I think he'll be there. And we need every vote. You know, Thad is—Thad Cochran is having a little bit of a problem, health-wise, and unfortunately, he would be a great vote for us. But he may not be here, so that's almost like a \"no\" vote. So that's a problem for us.\nBut we're working very hard. And you know, we had a real win on health care, and then, as you know, John amazingly voted against us. John McCain amazingly voted against.\nHealth Care ReformMr. Katz.Did you ever speak to him about that? Did you ever reach out to him and say, Senator, what are you thinking?\nI thought it was rather incredible that that happened. You know, you're talking repeal and replace for years—don't forget, I've been doing this for 2 years. They've been saying \"repeal and replace\" for 7. So I was surprised.\nBut we're going to get health care. Health care is going to happen. When I knocked out the CSRs—when we knocked out, almost, I—you look at it, $800 million, $700 million a month—all of a sudden, everyone is talking to me now. And we're going to get health care. We're going to get it, probably, in a short-term form and then in a long-term form. Maybe the blocks—we do the block grants. But we will have health care.\nYes, no—look, she's a politician. And we—I think we get along fine, but she's a politician. She's on the other side. The Democrats have had a very failed policy, as you know. The truth is, they're good at one thing, and that's obstruction. They obstruct anything from getting through.\nI have nominees that I have half the number that President Obama had approved at this point. They're waiting forever, and they know they're going to get approved, but it takes too much time. We have judicial appointments that are taking forever to get approved.\nSo the Democrats are obstructing Government, and that's what they do best. Their policy is terrible. They're not good politicians, but they obstruct. And that's what Nancy is doing. That's why if you mention Nancy's name in a campaign like I did, where, as you know, Karen out in Atlanta, she ended up winning a campaign where the person against her and against the Republicans spent $32 million for Congress. And the whole campaign was about Nancy Pelosi, and we ended up winning.\nWell, Karen is going to do a great job. But she ended up winning by five or six points, and as you know, $32 million was spent. And it was said to be a lost race. I got involved the last 3 or 4 days, and she won that race. And honestly, you mention Nancy Pelosi, and you get a good result, from the standpoint of being a Republican. And I hope Nancy continues to keep her position, because I think that's very important.\nBut I do get along with her. I get along with her very well. I get along with Schumer very well. But they're on the other side. What they are doing is obstructing.Tax Reform/Tax Relief\nLook, I just want the job to be done. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We are taxed beyond belief, and we need tax relief; we need tax reductions. This is really tax cuts we're talking about. It's also reform, but more importantly, it's tax cuts. We're the highest taxed nation in the world. We need tax cuts for the middle class, we need them for business. Businesses are leaving our country.\nNow, I have to say, I've turned that around, where businesses now are starting to come back in because they know that I'm going to get something very substantial having to do with tax cuts. But businesses now—you see the car companies, what's happening—they're expanding, they're coming into the country. You see Foxconn that makes the Apple iPhone.\nYou see Apple, you see a lot of other—they're building plants. No, businesses are starting to—but we need to make it—really, what I want to have it, we need these massive tax cuts. These will be the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, and it will make us grow like you wouldn't believe.\nAnd the big problem is, we can't really compete competitively when China is at 15 percent and we're at 35 percent.\nSo the 35 percent is coming all the way down to 20.\nWell, I love it. It's a place that I happen to love. You know, Indiana has been very good for me. And Mike Pence has been terrific. He's my friend, and he's been great. So anytime anybody wants to build in Indiana, I'm okay with that.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nTake care. Appreciate it.

{"Title": "Interview With Chris Plante of WMAL Radio in Washington, District of Columbia", "Date": "2017-10-17", "Text": "Nice to see you.\nOh, that's good. I hope I said hello, huh?\nWell, that's good. They're doing a great job.\nGood.\nAbsolutely. [Laughter]\nThank you.\nWell, we're the highest taxed nation in the world. Our companies are leaving, although I've stopped the flow to a large extent, but our companies are leaving because our taxes are so high. So they're going to other countries where they pay much lower taxes. They're firing our workers; everybody is fired. They open up, and then they build product, and they sell it right back into our country.\nSo we're the highest taxed nation in the world. We'll be one of the lower taxed nations in the world. Not the lowest, but one of the lowest. We'll be highly competitive. You look at China, they're at 15 percent. We're at 35 percent. You look at other countries like Ireland and many other countries are—I mean, they're 8 percent and 10 percent and 12 percent. So we're going from 35 all the way down to 20, which will have a massive impact and keep companies here. I mean, it's going to keep companies here, and companies are going to move back to the United States.\nAnd what it really means is jobs, because those companies are going to need people to work, and it's going to be jobs. It's going to be great jobs and great wages.\nYes. [Laughter] We have it. That's right.\nThree-point-two. And this one would have been even better other than we'll be affected somewhat by the hurricanes. The hurricanes were so massive that we'll have some kind of an impact by the hurricanes. But we're doing even better than we did then.\nSo you're right, they hadn't hit—as you know, for a full year, they never hit 3 percent. It's the weakest recovery ever by far, and we've already hit 3.2 percent. And we're doing good, but the tax cuts really make us something special.\nYou know, every point in GDP is $2½ trillion and millions of jobs. But think of it—$2.5 trillion. So one point pays for everything, and I think we're going to have numerous points, not just one point.\nISIS is being—totally.\nIt had to do with the people I put in, and it had to do with rules of engagement. We weren't fighting to win, we were fighting to be politically correct. It had to do with a whole set of things that I did.\nI also gave the power to the people on the ground. The White House used to get calls—\"Can we do this? Can we do that?\"—to places and in places that they had never even heard of. And by the time they got back a week, and 2 and 3 weeks later, there was no fight left, okay? It was ridiculous.\nSo I totally changed rules of engagement. I totally changed our military. I totally changed the attitudes of the military. And they have done a fantastic job. Yes, ISIS is now giving up. They're giving up. They're raising their hands. They're walking off. Nobody has ever seen that before, and that's good.\nBecause you didn't have Trump as your President. I mean, it was a big difference. I mean, there's a big, big difference if you look at the military now, and you look—look at what's going on in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a breeding ground for terrorists. That's why I had to stay in. I would have loved to have gone out, but I had to stay in.\nBut you see what's going on with Afghanistan. We're making more headway in the last—I changed rules of engagement about a month ago, and we're fighting now to win as opposed to fighting to just stay there. And you know, we were losing. Now we're winning.\nSo a lot of good things. We have to get rid of the terrorists.\nProbably not everybody.\nThat's true.\nSo I was left with a big, fat mess. The Middle East, North Korea—so many different problems, so many bad relationships with other countries, an economy that was not doing well, an economy that had the lowest—you know, it was the lowest improvement that anyone has ever seen outside of some very bad times.\nWe were not doing well. People were leaving, jobs were leaving, and we've turned it around. I've turned much of it around. Now, North Korea continues to be a big problem, and we will handle it. The Middle East is something. It's too bad we ever went there in the first place.\nI wish that they decided not to go. I wish President Obama didn't get out the way he got out, because that's left a vacuum, and ISIS was formed. But we have done some job in the Middle East, and we have done a great job with ISIS in terms of getting rid of vast numbers. We have done more in terms of ISIS, doing what we have to do. It doesn't sound very pleasant, but doing what we have to do. We've done more in 9 months than the previous administration has done, literally, during the entire 8-year period.\nWell, I think I've been surprised by a lot of things. And when you say surprised, I know the level of viciousness in the world. I know the level of hate in the world.\nI know the level of—actually, dishonesty in the media is one of the things that surprised me the most. I thought after I won, the media would become much more stable and much more honest. They've gone crazy. CNN is a joke. NBC is a total joke. You watch what they report, it bears no relationship to what I'm doing. But the media is absolutely dishonest. And I have never seen—frankly, I've never seen anything quite like it.\nBut the New York Times, the Washington Post, they write whatever they want to write. You know, they have an agenda. We'll have to figure out what their agenda is, but they do have an agenda. I think that's one of the biggest surprises is the level of dishonesty.\nInterestingly, after I won, I said, well, now I'll bet the media starts to shape up and, you know, it's over, so now—and it actually has gotten worse than during the campaign.\nWhat impresses me most is that the people—the voters—they get it. They get it. And I think we're higher now than we've ever been. I think people are loving the job I'm doing. Yesterday you saw what we did with Iran, and you saw what we did with the CSR payments, which were going right into the pockets of the insurance companies. And now we're going to be able to do something very good.\nSo we're doing a good job.\n2018 Congressional Elections/Health Care Reform/Senator John S. McCain III\nI think so. I think we'll have a lot done. We need some votes from some of the Republicans that for some reason, they weren't there on health care. They should have been. We thought we had it, but John McCain voted no, which was a shocker.\nYes, well, I hear it. And people have to be careful, because at some point, I fight back. You know, I'm being very nice.\nI'm being very, very nice. But at some point, I fight back, and it won't be pretty.Mr. Plante.All right. Mr. President, thank you very much. Getting the wave-off over here from your good people. I appreciate your time very much, sir.\nThank you. Thank you for everything.

{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Alexios Tsipras of Greece", "Date": "2017-10-17", "Text": "Thank you very much. I just want to make an initial comment that the stock market just hit an alltime record high. It broke, for the first time ever, 23,000. So we're very happy about that. I hope that Greece is going to be doing the same thing very soon. [Laughter] I think they will.\nBut I'm honored to welcome Prime Minister Tsipras to Greece—from—of Greece, and he's a special man who's done a very special job. We're grateful to the Prime Minister and to his entire delegation for visiting us today at the White House.\nGreece is a cradle of Western civilization—so true—of democracy, literature, philosophy, science, and so much else. America looks on that glorious heritage with wonder and with awe. You do indeed have a tremendous heritage, Mr. Prime Minister.\nPerhaps for this reason, America's friendship with the Greek people has been long and enduring. Thomas Jefferson wrote at the dawn of the modern Greek state that \"no people sympathize more\" with Greek patriots and \"none offer more sincere and ardent prayers to heaven for their success\" than the American people. Jefferson's words are true to this day.\nWe'll take a few questions. John [John Roberts, Fox News], go ahead, please.\nThank you. Nice place.\nIt's a nice place.\nYes, essentially, that would be the plan. Yes, block grants.\nI wish I knew that before my speech. [Laughter]Prime Minister Tsipras.The meeting I had with the President—his approach and the way he addresses most publics—[inaudible].The U.S. is a very strong power, and their ability to intervene for good are very, very important.\nI want to confirm that the meeting that we had was very productive. Not a moment did I feel threatened at any time. I saw that there is a very fertile outlook here. In order to set aside any differences that we may have to find the common ground, the common ground which is really important for the relationship between the two—our two peoples that are traditional and historical and for our common objectives.\nWe need common values—we have common values, excuse me. Don't forget that the value of democracy and freedom was born in Greece, and it's one of the basic values that traverses American culture and American tradition. The President today, of the U.S., is—continues this tradition. And I think our collaboration will be very substantial, and I'm very optimistic after our meeting that we had today.\nThank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I might just add that a number of countries were a little bit nervous at the beginning. And I have very good relationships with the leaders of virtually every country I've dealt with. But the reason they were concerned was because I will not allow our country, the United States of America, to be taken advantage of by so many other countries all over the world.\nIf you look at our trade deficits, massive trade deficits with virtually every country. If you look at our jobs moving out to certain countries, and the companies are leaving, and they're firing the people, and the product is made elsewhere, and then it's sold back into the United States. I'm not going to be allowing that.\nSo I can understand how certain countries and the leaders of certain countries may feel. But we're just not going to allow the United States to be taken advantage of by other countries anymore. And there's nothing we can do about that.\nThank you.\nOkay, you have a question.\nGreece's Economy/Greece-U.S. Relations\nI can say that we have a great confidence in Greece. I think it's a land of tremendous potential. I know many people are looking to invest in Greece. A lot of the problems are behind it. They've had some very good leadership. They've really done a lot of—they've made a lot of difficult decisions.\nWe are helping, as you know, with a massive renovation of their air force and also of airplanes, generally, going to Greece. They're looking at buying additional planes from Boeing. And we are helping—we're very much involved with Greece and with helping Greece get back on its feet. We have a tremendous Greek population in this country, people whose heritage is Greece. And we love that country, special country, one of the most beautiful countries in the world. And so I think it's got great potential, and we are helping it along.\nSure.\nI would say within those five you'll probably get the answer. And I'll be making this decision over the next fairly short period of time.Q.Can you say who your favorite is at this point?\nHonestly, I like them all.\nI do. I have a great respect for all of them. But I'll make a decision over the next very short period of time.\nSure, sure.\nYes, we have been involved. And this is a short-term deal, because we think, ultimately, block grants going to the States is going to be the answer. That's a very good solution. We think it's going to not only save money, but give people much better health care with a very, very much smaller premium spike—and you look at what has gone on with that—also, much lower deductibles so they can use it.\nLamar has been working very, very hard with the Democratic—his colleagues on the other side, and Patty Murray is one of them, in particular. And they're coming up, and they're fairly close to a short-term solution. The solution will be for about a year or 2 years, and it will get us over this intermediate hump, because we have—as you probably know, we have—we either have the votes or we are very close to having the votes. And we will get the votes for having, really, the potential of having great health care in our country.\nSo they are indeed working, but it is a short-term solution so that we don't have this very dangerous little period—including dangerous period for insurance companies, by the way. For a period of 1 year, 2 years, we will have a very good solution. But we're going to have a great solution, ultimately, for health care. Okay?\nAnd they are working together, and I know very much what they're doing. Okay? Thank you.\nWell, I'd just start by saying that I think it has a great role in stability in the area. We have a feeling that it will get stronger and stronger. Very stable people. It's got the potential to be—once it gets over this tremendous financial hurdle that it's in the process of working out, we think that there will be great stability in Greece and militarily and in every way we look at it as very important, and very important to the United States.\nWe have great confidence in Greece as a nation. We have great confidence in what they're doing relative to their military, because I know they have plans to do some terrific things. And we know they will be an ally for many, many years to come. You know, they've always been a very reliable ally, and we've always been very reliable to them. So we look forward to that for many years. We're going to be friends for many, many years, and stability is very important. And we look upon that, with respect to Greece, as being a key. Okay?\nThank you.\nWell, I want to thank everybody. And the Prime Minister came out here, and he said, this is so beautiful. I said, this is the Rose Garden. And I think even the media likes the Rose Garden. [Laughter] That's hard to believe, but even the media likes it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-alexios-tsipras-greece"}
{"Title": "Interview with Maria Bartiromo of FOX Business Network", "Date": "2017-10-20", "Text": "Thank you.\nWe're doing very well. We will — we had a fantastic vote, as you know, and was — budget is indirectly passed. Now it's going to go through a little bit of an iteration but it's going to end up, I think, again doing very well. And I think we're going to get our taxes.\nI think it's going to be — well, hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that. So there's a great spirit for it, people want to see it, and I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also, but I call it tax cuts. It'll be the biggest cuts ever in the history of this country.\nAnd I think that there's tremendous appetite. There's tremendous spirit for it, not only by the people we're dealing with in Congress, but for the people out there that want to see something — $5,000, almost. It can be $5,000 average per individual, — per group. And so, I'm really looking forward to it. Let's see what happens.\nI think we have the votes. I think that Rand Paul actually is going to vote for the tax cuts. I think that other people — you know, we had tremendous enthusiasm this time. Health care, I was told was tougher but it was close. I mean, so far, I would say it's not even a contest.\nAnd I will tell you — speaking of health care, I believe we're going to get that also. It'll be in the form of block grants to the different states. And it'll be a wonderful health care. It'll be a tremendous health care, managed properly in smaller doses where you can really do it much more individually.\nSo I think we're going to get that also. And a little bit later, probably in three or four months from now, but I do believe we'll have that long before the election in '18. As far as taxes are concerned, you see what's happening. It's really doing well, great enthusiasm.\nWell I've — I have looked at it very, very strongly. And pretty much, we can do almost what they're getting. I — I think he is a tremendous person. I don't know Senator Murray. I hear very, very good things.\nI know that Lamar Alexander's a fine man and he is really in there to do good for the people. We can do pretty much what we have to do without, you know, the Secretary has tremendous leeway in the — under the Obama plans. One of the things that they did, because they were so messed up, they had no choice but to give the Secretary leeway because they knew he'd have to be — he or she would have to be changing all the time.\nAnd we can pretty much do whatever we have to do just the way it is. So this was going to be temporary, prior to repeal and replace. We're going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nAnd I think we actually have the votes. People are criticizing me for saying that. I think we actually have the votes for that. You know, we were basically one short and I think we're going to have the votes for that also, Maria.\nNo, and sometimes it helps, to be honest with you. So we'll see what happens in the end. But I think, actually sometimes it helps. Sometimes it gets people to do what they're supposed to be doing. And you know, that's the way it is.\nI just want what's right. And I think, for the most part, they want what's right too. So we'll see what happens but I do believe we have the votes for health care at the appropriate time. And I think we're going to have the votes for taxes and I will say the fact that healthcare is so difficult, I think, makes the taxes easier. The republicans want to get it done and it's a tremendous tax cut. I mean, especially for the middle class and especially for business.\nWe have — we're loosing our companies. We have companies leaving and I have to say since I've been elected, that's really stopped, it's really slowed down. There's a tremendous enthusiasm for business in this country. So, a lot of things have changed.\nIt's been fantastic.\nWell I think they should and I think they will. I think a lot of things are happening unless, you know, it's going to be right after that. But I don't even like them leaving. But I will say this, I want to get it by the end of the year but I'd be very disappointed if it took that long.\nIt could be substantially less than that depending on what happens when we send the bill back to the House. You know, they'll send it back and people are going to go and make 200 suggestions as opposed to maybe no suggestions because it's a great bill. It's going to be a great bill. And we're adjusting.\nWe're adjusting so that there's no way that the middle class doesn't greatly benefit. Every once in a while there's a method under which, you know, it could be that some people in the middle class won't benefit as much as we want them to benefit and we're making certain adjustments but I think we're going to have it sooner rather than later.\nWell, he really said that on the basis that I wanted it or was thinking about it because I want to make sure the middle class gets taken care of. So, in that way, yes, but actually we do have four brackets because we have a zero bracket and people aren't including that.\nSo, that would actually make it a fifth bracket as opposed to an eight bracket on the other side, on the other way. I call that our competition which is the competition from the past. No, I think that when Paul says that — we may not have that. I would rather do that than do anything to hurt the middle class.\nRight.\nI think this, look, you know, I am very happy with the way I've done part of this in my civilian life, all right.\nOther people — well it's about me representing rich people.\nRepresenting — being representative of rich people. Very interesting to me Bob Kraft was down. He was very nice. He owns the Patriots. He gave me a Super Bowl ring a month ago. And he —-\nWhich was very nice. That's right. But he left this beautiful ring and I immediately give it to the White House and they put it some place and that's the way it is.\nHe said to me — he's a good man. He said to me you have to do us all a favor, give the tax decrease to the middle class, we don't need it. We don't need it. We don't want it. Give it to the middle class. And, I've had many people, very wealthy people tell me the very same thing. I've had very few say I want more, I want more.\nThey really want to see — you know the middle class has really not done very well over the last long period of time. And, so when Paul mentions maybe one more category which I'd rather not have, it may not happen. But the only reason I would have — and he does say this, he's very plain on what he said is that if for any reason that the other middle class is not being properly taken care of.\nSo, that's a big factor but we have so many things that are going to be so great bringing the corporate tax down maybe is the most important. And, we have a lot of most important but bringing it down from 35 down to 20 percent that's a massive — that' the biggest that we've ever done.\nThat's a big deal for companies; that's a big deal for investment. I think one of the other ones is expensing, you know when you write something off in one year as opposed to you know over many years, I think that's going to be tremendous.\nWe have so many things in this plan that are going to be for growth and you know your next questions going to be deficit so and on, and I fully understand that we all understand it, and growth, if we pick up one point on GDP that's $2.5 trillion if you think of.\nTwo point five it more than pays for everything and I think we pick up much more than 1 point, and I've been the one that's saying we're going to hit 3 sooner later than later, in the last quarter we 3.2.\nWe haven't been there real — we haven't been there in a long time, it's been a long time.\nAs you know the previous administration didn't hit it for the year for 8 years. In 8 years it didn't hit it at all. Here we hit it you know an early quarter for me, and actually before that it was down in the ones, it was down in the ones.\nWell, you know I call up — I become friendly with leaders of other very, very large countries and say how're you doing, and they would say \"We're not doing well, we are not doing well. GDP is at 7%, GDP is at 8%, we are not happy.\"\nAnd I'm saying you know we had it a 1% so I really think we can do much more than a —let's see what happens, but 1 point is 2.5 trillion and millions of jobs.\nYeah.\nBy the way that's an automatic talking point.\nI don't think so— it doesn't seem like it we got the budget passed.\nSo here's the thing Schumer, I like Schumer, but before he even knows the plan he'll say \"Oh this is for the rich\" so he doesn't even know what the plan is, and he's screaming it for the rich.\nHe did it with healthcare too, he said \"This is for the rich, this is for the rich you're not going to get your coverage.\" Everybody is going to go into hospitals; that's going to be terrible, the world is coming to an end, OK.\nDo you know what the plan was. That's OK you know we're all learning politics right, and he said that well, he says the same thing because I saw him two days ago before he really knew what was happening, he said \"Oh no it's for the rich.\"\nSo it's an automatic statement, it's like in business you ask for twice as much I mean.\nI do.\nYou know I've always gotten along with him.\nI don't think it matters, I mean I really don't, but I met with the Senate Finance Committee, I met with the Republicans, Democrats together right across the hallway two days ago we had a great meeting.\nRon Wyden was — is their Chairman we had a fantastic meeting, there's a lot of similarity they want tax cuts also Maria. They want tax cuts and they want them as fast as possible.\nNow they don't want to say it and their saying \"Oh gee, you know the — the — the middle class I call them the working people because they really are the working people, but the middle class doesn't benefit that's — that's their standard but they know it they do benefit.\nJobs.\nWell, there's a lot more I mean really lot more, I mean I think I can double it before it's over, but a lot of it's statutory where you have to give a 90 day notice and then you have give 120 day, we've given those notices I mean we're going to be doing a lot more.\nWell I guess some people talk about freedom and other people talk about we want to know who's taking adds or doing whatever and I would imagine something's going to come down along the lines of like we are doing right now. For regular — you know whether it's commercial or not for a normal broadcast company.\nIt'll be very interesting to see. You know that's a argument that's happening right now. It'll be very interesting to see what — there are two very distinct views on that. I can go — honestly I can go either way on it.\nWell as you know I — I've been seeing a number of people and most people are saying it's down to two, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Powell. I also met with Janet Yellen, who I like a lot. I really like her a lot. So I have three people that I'm looking at. And there are a couple of others.\nI said I will make my decision very shortly, pretty shortly.\nIt is in my thinking. And I have a couple of other things in my thinking. But I like talent. And they are both very talented people. And it's a hard decision. It's actually a very important decision. People have no — most people have no idea how important that position is. That position is actually — more — a lot of people get rid of the Fed.\nTake the Fed out. That's a very important position. It's also important psychotically. If the right person is there a lot of good things can happen. I think I'm doing a good job for businesses in that way. People are coming into the country; you saw what happened with Foxconn going to Wisconsin.\nYou see what's happening with Apple where there — I said to Tim — I said to Tim Cook, I said Tim I want some of those beautiful plants that I see in China. They have to open in the country. You got to give me some big beautiful plants, it's happening. It's all happening.\nThe auto companies are coming back into our country. Coming up to Michigan again, they are going back. We're not going to be taken advantage of. We were taken advantage of — I wouldn't say the companies so much, but by other countries. We were so badly taken advantage of.\nAs you know we're negotiating with NAFTA. And they have an election right now, and lots of things. But at some point either NAFTA will be renegotiated so that it's fair to the United States or it will be terminated. It was very simple. People think that's a very tough statement. But it will probably be renegotiated but if it's not successfully renegotiated so it's fair for the United States, it will be terminated.\nWell it's going to be all growth. Look it's going to be growth. I think that growth can be staggering. I also think we have a lot of waste in this country. And we'll be doing other things. We will be doing welfare reform. I mean that's coming up.\nOkay, and whether people like it or not. You know people don't like having a house and working three jobs and having somebody nearby where their living better than the person with the three jobs. It's not fair. And that's all coming up, believe me that's going to be out there very soon.\nI want to get the taxes first. I want to get health care. We're doing a big infrastructure bill which will be a very positive thing. But we're going to have tremendous growth.\nI could tie it. I was thinking about tying it but there's too many honestly. You lose a few votes, you gain a few votes. I don't want to take any chances cause I feel we have the votes right now the way it is.\nSo the tax will come up, the infrastructure will come up, the health care will come up, I have an economic develop plan, that I would like to propose that I think will be, you know very, very good for our country. I think the growth in the country is going to be tremendous. I think we have tremendous potential, it's hard to believe because it has been, you know going for a long time.\nBut the waste, the trade deals we have, that are so bad. You know, the money you're taking about is, peanuts compared to the trade deals. We lose with Mexico, almost 70 in terms of trade deficits, almost $70 billion dollars a year. We lose with China $100s of billions a year, we lose almost every country. If you look at I mean there is hardly a country. I can name two, and it is tiny surpluses, tiny.\nWe lose with almost every country, we have massive deficits. And that is gonna change, we can't allow the world to look at us as a whipping post. Not gonna happen, anymore.\nWell I wanna do it, because one the one thing have do, is have to spend on defense. This is a very rough time out there. I was left a mess, whether the people like or not, I think we can say it in different ways. I was left a mess, whether it was North Korea or the Middle East, where we have made more progress against ISIS.\nLiterally Maria, we have made more progress against ISIS in the last 9 months, than in the last 8 years, as you know. I mean as everybody—\nI mean it's not a question of tough talk, we have also produced, I mean the Middle East is a whole different ball game right now as far as ISIS is now, is concerned. But, but we have to…we are in a world, there's a lot hatred in this world. There is a lot of hatred towards us in the world. We need a strong military, stronger than ever before, and we are going to have that.\nSo I do want to get rid of the caps at least at some point in the near future.\nIt is such an interesting question, because I have friends that say, oh, don't use social media. See I don't call it Tweets, Tweeting is like a typewriter — when I put it out, you put it immediately on your show. I mean the other day, I put something out, two seconds later I am watching your show, it's up —\nOK, and then, you know they are well crafted. I was always good student, I am like a person that does well with that kind of thing. And I doubt I would be here if weren't for social media, to be honest with you. Because there is a fake media out there, I get treated very unfairly by the media.\nAnd I have a tremendous platform. I think I have a 125 million people between Twitter and Instagram and all of them and Facebook. I have a tremendous platform.\nSo when somebody, says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it. The other way, I would never be get the word out. I had a big rally, we were in Texas for something and I then I went back unfortunately for the hurricanes.\nBut one women was standing, I had thousands and thousands of people, but woman was saying 'keep tweeting, it matters.' It is sorta of an interesting — I really believe, again I don't call it, I call it social media.\nYou have to keep people interested also. You know, you have to keep people interested. But, social media, without social media, I am not sure that would be here talking. I would probably not be here talking.\nYou know what I find; the ones don't want me to are the enemies. The people who really don't like, what happened with me and winning the election and all of the things. Those are the ones who say he should, I remember, I was in — I was in a faraway land and I was tweeting. And I said very little. I said like, \"I'm in Italy right now,\" you know, for the summits. So \"I'm in Italy right now and the weather is wonderful.\" And one of the — one of the dishonest networks said \"Donald Trump is on a Twitter stomp again — President Trump.\"\nThey say \"President Trump is on a Twitter stomp\" within one tweet. It is such dishonesty. But without social media, I'm not sure that I'd be here today, so I don't…\nI don't think I want to take any chances. And we do get points out there — I mean, we get tremendous points. I can express my views when somebody expresses maybe a false view that they said I gave.\nIt works — It just seems to work. I mean, it is a little unconventional.\nHe is a — a very elegant man. He is a tough, strong four-star Marine. You're a four-star Marine, you've got something special to start off with, OK? General Mattis, General Dunford also, but very few. He — he was so offended, because he was in the room when I made the call and so were other people. And the call was a very nice call. He was so offended that a woman would be — that somebody would be listening to that call.\nHe was — he actually couldn't believe it. Actually, he said to me \"Sir, this is not acceptable. This is really not\" — and he knew — I was so nice. Look, I've called many people. And I would think that every one of them appreciated it. I was very surprised to see this to be honest with you.\nAnd by the way, I spoke of the name of the young man and I — it was a really — it's a very tough call. Those are the toughest calls.\nThese are tougher than dealing with the heads of countries, believe me. These are very, very hard calls. They're sad. And sometimes, you know, the grieving is so incredible. But he's just an elegant man and a wonderful man and he's doing a fantastic job as chief.\nHe doesn't need this job. In fact, he didn't really want this job. He was so happy, you know, he's a military guy. He was doing this incredible job on the border and elsewhere, you know, he ran homeland like nobody has ever run it, down 78 percent of the border crossings.\nThat's before the wall — he — there's nobody close. You go to the original first day, there was nobody close to doing the job. And I said \"I'd like to take you. How would you like it?\" And it's not that he wanted it. Actually, he would have preferred doing and staying where he was. He's a man that felt it would be important for the country. He does it for the country. He's not doing it for what he wants. He does it for the country.\nHe's a very unusual man. So when she made that statement, I thought it was sickening, actually.\nWhat we're going to see — we are working on DACA, we'll see if we can get something with DACA. We have to build the wall, we have to — all you have to do is look at what's happening in Mexico. We have to build a wall. Going to stop drug traffic in to a large extent. I mean, what's happening with drugs — and I'll be making a big announcement on that next week.\nWhat's happening with drugs in our country — and by the way, in the world. It's not like we're singled out. But it's never been like this. And a lot of the drugs come through that southern border. And we need a wall. We're going to have a wall. We have to — I would like to do something with DACA and we are negotiating, right with the Democrats, and we'll see if we can come up with a solution. But I can tell you, I and the Republicans are very open to it. We have to get something in return.\nRight.\nHonestly, I told them. They're friends of mine. They really are. I get along with all of them. Whether it's Emmanuel, or whether it's Angela, I get along — I really like those people.\nI told them, just keep making money. Don't worry about it. We don't need you on this. You just keep making money. When Iran buys things from Germany and from France and from the various — by billions of dollars, even us, they were going to buy Boeings. I don't know what's going to happen with the deal.\nWe'll see what happens with the deal, but — but when they buy those things, it's a little harder for those countries to do something. Would they do it if I really was insistent? I believe they would.\nI told them just keep making money. Don't worry. We don't need you on this one.\nChina has been — I've developed a very good relationship with President Xi. President Xi is right now going through his Congress and it's going to be something very soon is going to happen.\nThat gives him something that few leaders of China have ever had, and I'm really good with that. And to be honest with — I told you on this, I want to keep things very, very low key until such time as he gets that. I want him to get that.\nI think he deserves that. He's a good man. But they have been helping us. They're closing off their banking systems to North Korea. They have cut the oil way down. Now, the banking systems we can see, because they all come through here as you know. The oil you can never really see what's going on, but the oil is way down. The oil is — they're doing a lot of things.\nFor the first time ever. Those are the recent article that said I have the greatest relationship of any president — the two of us, and I think we do. I really do. I think — I don't want to be foolish.\nHe's for China and I'm for the U.S., OK? So we start off with that, but we do have a very good — I would say an exceptional relationship. And China's really helping us, and — well, also with respect to North Korea, 93 percent of things going into North Korea come through China. China is big stuff.\nI believe he's got — he's got the power to do something very significant with respect to North Korea. We'll see what happens. Now with that being said, we're prepared for anything. We are so prepared, like you wouldn't believe.\nYou would be shocked to see how totally prepared we are if we need to be. Would it be nice not to do that? The answer is yes. Will that happen? Who knows, who knows, Maria.\nNo. I'm not — I think you've covered just about everything...\nWell, I think whatever they do, it's a positive. Honestly, whatever they do, it's a positive. Even if they buy back, they buy back and they give people money and the people are going to go spend the money, okay? And that's okay too.\nSo you know that people have said that, oh, supposedly, they keep the money or supposedly, they buy back stock. Well, they buy back stock, the stock — the money's going to people and they're going to go out and buy a something — I won't say — I was almost going to say something, but I won't say it. We have minimum, in my opinion, $3 trillion—\nOverseas or however you define it. In some cases not necessarily totally over – but overseas. We have minimum $3 trillion — it can never come back. You know what's interesting? That's something that Democrats for years. Democrats and republicans agree the money should come back. Who's not going to say the money should stay there, right?\nEverybody agrees — I would say unanimously, it was never done, it was never done. Because of lack of leadership. Because of something.\nNow, it was not only the high tax — it was a very high tax, nobody would pay it. I mean, unless you were desperate to get money, you wouldn't pay it, so it was a high tax. It was also bureaucratic boondoggle; you never saw anything like it. You couldn't — I looked at the amount of work you had to do to get that money in, aside from the tax — OK, all of that is going to be solved and we're going to have 3 trillion and I think it could be much more than that.\nYou know, we've been saying 2.5 trillion for years — you've been saying it. For years, we've been saying 2.5 trillion — well it's not 2.5 trillion anymore, I think it could be much more than that and it could be up to five, we'll see. We're going to know fairly soon because for the most past, with the deeming and everything else that's going to come in very soon, I think it's going to come in very quickly. But there's — at a minimum three $3 trillion coming into our country and that money is going to put to work one way or the other. So the great thing is, it's a great plan, there's never been anything like it, it's the biggest and it's the best and I think you're going to be very happy, you'll be impressed.\nThank you. Thank you very much, Maria.\nOh, yes, isn't' it great?\nWell, I think you see the extent of what we have to do. And it's far greater than anybody would understand, whether its countries, or whether it's war and peace, and protection. The most important thing is protecting our people. And you protect them from lots of different things and elements.\nWe've done a great job with ISIS. We've done a great job with – I think our military is getting stronger, stronger, stronger. I want to have it to a point where it's the strongest by far that has ever been. But number one is always going to be protection. But if you look at the economy – what we've done with the economy has been great.\nAnd regulations down to a level that nobody's ever seen. I mean nobody's done anything near what we've done. We've actually had a lot of legislation pass. A lot of people say, oh, gee, you have to get the taxes – you have to get the healthcare. They're two very biggies, but we have – we've passed legislation that I think more than almost any, out of the four to nine month period, more than any other president, they said Harry Truman –\nYes.\nYes.\nI don't think we'll use a fifth bracket. I only want to use the fifth bracket if at any reason I feel the middle class is not getting as much as I thought they would or as much as they are entitled to. They're entitled to a lot.\nThis is about the middle class. It's really about the middle class and about jobs. And if I feel that the middle class is not getting what I want them to get, and that's going to be a lot, because I want them to get really a lot. Then I'm going to do a fifth bracket, which will give them more.\nThank you very much.\nGreat to have you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-maria-bartiromo-fox-business-network-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Lou Dobbs of FOX Business Network", "Date": "2017-10-25", "Text": "Well, I think we're going to get it. I think these Senators are going to come together. I think the House is looking really good, you know, they're passing this bill along very rapidly. In fact, that's going to happen hopefully today. And I did make a couple of calls. I said -- fellas, please, no changes. Just pass it along. We have to get tax cuts. And just pass it along.\nWe have to get tax cuts. And just pass it along. Now normally, they want to make their 15 points or their 20 points and then it has to go back and it has to be re-voted and everything else. I said just pass it along. And they said think we're going to do that. And let's see what happens.\nBut I think they're going to do that. And so look, we have actually in the Republican Party, in a true sense, we have great unity. Look at the Democrats with Bernie Sanders who got absolutely taken advantage of by the DNC. And now see it, you know, all the stuff coming out. You see worse happening.\nBut you look at Hillary and Bernie, that's big league stuff. We have very, very minor -- we have great unity. I was with the Senate yesterday, the entire Republican Senate. And other than two people, I tell you, there was a lot of love in that room.\nA lot to get done. Yes.\nFor many years.\nMany years before.\nSo we have many things. Number one, we're bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. That's a massive -- this will be the biggest tax --\n...cut in history. In the history of our country. And that's great. And we need it. Because right now, our country's about the highest taxed or certainly one of the highest taxed in the world. And we can't have that. So we're going to have a country that's toward the lower end. I can't say it's the lowest. You know, Ireland is going now lower and others are going lower.\nThey played the game a lot better than our people have played the game, I can tell you that. But we're going to have a country that's going to have tax incentive now. And we are going to bring back -- you know, I've been talking and I even heard you say it not so long ago -- two and a half trillion.\nBut you and I have both been using that number for years.\nThat number is much higher now, because it's, you know, built up over the years. And I would be surprised if it weren't close to $4 trillion. That money's coming back. And nobody would bring it back now because the tax is so astronomical, they'd have to be desperate to bring it back.\nI mean any company that would bring it back and pay the tax that they have to pay, which probably ends up being close to 40 percent, who's going to pay that to bring money back in? So what they do is they leave their money in these other places and other countries and they spend it there and they create a lot of additional wealth there.\nWe want the money coming back here. But it could be $4 trillion. And what we're doing is substantially lowering the tax. And we're also getting rid of all the bureaucratic hurdles. It wasn't just the tax. I have friends that want to bring money back. The amount of work they have to do to get the approval to bring the money back is absolutely ridiculous.\nSo that's going away also.\nYou know, we've done so well. Pretty much record setting, certainly record setting for nine months in so many different ways. Nine months of a presidency. But you look at the market, how well it's doing, so you'd say well why do you have to do anything. We can actually do better.\nAnd I think we will do better. We are going to have so many jobs created by what we're doing. And you know, we're going to have companies that aren't going to be leaving our country anymore. You look at what's happened over the last 25 years, you go down and take a look at Mexico --\n-- and see how many car companies have built these massive factories in Mexico. Not here. We want them built in Michigan, and Ohio, and our places. And they just leave, and they fire everybody, and they go and open up plants. That's not going to be happening anymore, plus they're going to be penalized in many different ways if they do it.\nIt's terrible.\nWell you're right, and it's surprising to me. For instance, NAFTA is a horrible agreement, one of the worst trade deals ever. It's just one of the worst. Although TPP, which I terminated before it got signed -- before it got finished, someday hopefully people will be thanking. That would have been one of the great disasters of all times, in terms of trade. --\nAnd a lot of people understand that, but a lot of people don't. But I was very honored to have just terminated that. And we'll do bilateral deals with all those countries. We'll do it great. And if they don't do -- treat us properly, we'll do a termination or we'll do whatever we want to do. These deals, once you get into them --\nOK. So I would say this. In order to have a resolution -- because right now, Mexico and Canada have such a great deal -- it's so good that it's very hard for them to get used to the fact that it can't be that way anymore. And as you know, Mexico has an election coming up and they have a number of people that are running and they're very pro Mexico.\nWhich is -- in fact, they wore a hat -- a green hat that says, \"Make Mexico Great Again.\" They call them -- they call them the Donald Trump of politics. They have a couple of them, actually. And it's very hard. I said, you -- you negotiate -- I tell my people. I say, right now, it's going to be very hard. And in my opinion, in order to make a fair deal with NAFTA, you have to terminate the deal and you have to see where you're going to come. And we'll come out\nBut I think you have to give them -- to make a fair deal and a great deal, and you see what's going on, we're being very tough and we're being very fair. But we have to get back a lot. What's happened to this country with NAFTA is unbelievable. The jobs that have been taken, the factories that are moving out of our -- out of Michigan, out of Ohio, out of Pennsylvania, out of our states is incredible.\nSo what are the chances? I think the chances, ultimately, are good. But right now, I think my people are going to have to get tougher.\nAnd I told them that.\nBut look at it a different way.\nWe have a trade deficit with Mexico. --\nMexico's wonderful. But we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $71 billion a year. This is Mexico. We weren't talking about China, which is much worse. --\nWe have a trade deficit right now with Mexico of $71 billion. People can't believe it. --\nThat we have trade deficits -- well, we have trade deficits with almost everybody. --\nBut we're changing that.\nIt's unbelievable.\nThe WTO, World Trade Organization, was set up for the benefit for everybody but us.\nThey have taken advantage of this country like you wouldn't believe.\nAnd I say to my people, you tell them, like as an example, we lose the lawsuits, almost all of the lawsuits in the WTO -- within the WTO.\nBecause we have fewer judges than other countries. It's set up as you can't win. In other words, the panels are set up so that we don't have majorities. It was set up for the benefit of taking advantage of the United States. NAFTA and I tell people and I tell good people, they hear me -- I'm going to be very tough with NAFTA.\nBut they hear I'm getting tough with -- they said 'please don't touch it.' I say, listen. I'm going to make the detail better. 'Oh, don't touch it.' I said, supposing I don't terminate it, but I make it better. 'Oh, don't touch it.' And I say, why would they not want me to make it better?\nEven if assuming you leave it the way it is, which we may or we may not. It depends how the negotiation turns out. We may not. But look, they don't even want you to touch it, even if you tell them, we're going to make it better. Then you say to yourself, what's going on. And then you say, well they must be on the other side of the deal too. And they are. They have companies that have factories in Mexico.\nBut I'm not interested in them, I'm interested here.\nThat's very interesting. It's well put. It's true.\nI really think they're coming along. I really do. I think they are coming along. One thing you didn't mention which you will mention and I know you talk about it is the power of the pharmaceutical companies.\nWe pay so much more for the same pill, prescription drugs than other countries. You go to Canada -- people go to Canada to buy prescriptions.\nWe pay for the exact same pill, made from same plant, the same company, we pay in many cases, many, many times more than they're paying in other countries. So we're subsidizing the world in terms of prescription drugs. It's ridiculous. And it's going to stop.\nThe problem I have is these companies give so much -- I mean the contributions are massive, just massive, the amount. But we do have -- there are a lot of good people that are seeing what's going on. And I think we'll be successful in that. Next week, I'm going to declaring an emergency, national emergency on drugs.\nThe opioid is a tremendous emergency, what's going on there. The drugs pouring into the country have gotten -- and I tell you what, we've made a big impact. But still, we need the wall. You know, part of the reason we need the wall is for drugs.\nForgetting even about people, we need a wall for drugs. And the wall's coming along. You know, we're building right now prototypes. We have six prototypes. I'm going to be looking at them over the next three weeks.\nWell, you know, it's funny. It's very interesting. Almost glad you asked because it's actually pretty easy to understand. You think of a wall as a wall. But honestly you do need some see through ability because you don't know who's – if you do pure concrete which is a wall then you can't see who's on the other side.\nYou know you have a wall that's this thick and you can't see who's on the other side. So, we're going to need some see through abilities. So, I'm going to be going down. We actually have six prototypes that are all very top of the line. Done with Homeland Security.\nBut I've had the people at that level. Those are the people, they know so much. They know more than anybody and they also know the wall and the wall systems. And, we're going to take a look at the wall and we're going to get it built and it's going to be – it's going to be quite the wall. It's going to be very effective.\nRight.\nWonder who that might be?\nI think I know but you know I'll let them find out. They're going to find out eventually just like they did – don't forget Hillary Clinton totally denied this. She didn't know anything. She knew nothing. All of a sudden they found out. What I was amazed at, it's almost $6 million that they paid and it's totally discredited, it's a total phony. I call it fake news.\nIt's disgraceful. It's disgraceful.\nAnd then, I understand recently she said well opposition research. Opposition research is very standard. So, it's very interesting, she denied it, her own people denied it. Everybody denied it and now they're sort of scooting around trying to figure out what to say.\nSo, they spent, if you think of it, almost $6 million on something like that and I think honestly I just think it's a disgrace.\nThat's the real collusion. Believe me.\nThere was no collusion on my side. I can tell you that. Everybody knew it. You knew it because you were saying it when it was not in vogue but I always said and I had no idea how right I was because I didn't realize it would be for this extent.\nBut I always said this was an excuse for losing the election put out by the democrats and that's what it was. But then when you hear the kind of money they spent and when you see all of the things about Podesta and you see all of the relationships that they actually have with Russia and you see in hers.\nYou know one thing that is interesting and I have to say even the democrats they walk out of those meetings and they say no there is no collusion and we haven't found any yet but we'll keep going.\nA wonderful man came to my office a week ago. A very highly respected man and he sat down and he said, \"You know it's been very unfair. From the day you have been president you've been under this little veil of Russia, Russia, Russia.\" And with all of this being said, I want to say this, I think it would be great if we got along with Russia.\nI don't think there's anything wrong with – you know they are a power, they're a nuclear power. I think we could have a good relationship. I think that North Korean situation would be easier settled. And I just spoke to the President of China, I congratulated him on his big victory. But it would be wonderful if we could speak to China and Russia. Because China is helping us and maybe Russia's going through the other way and hurting what we're getting.\nI mean when I say maybe, I think I know exactly what I'm talking about. If we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing.\nJust spoke to him a few minutes ago, just before I walked into the room. You know, something has been given to him that's never been --\n-- it's really virtually never happened in China. He's been given powers that nobody's --\nHe's a powerful man. I happen to think he's a very good person. Now with that being said, he represents China, I represent the USA, so, you know, there's going to always be conflict. But we have a very good relationship. People say we have the best relationship of any president-president, because he's called president also.\nNow some people might call him the king of China. But he's called president. But we have a very good relationship and that's a positive thing. And it would be good to have that relationship with Russia and other countries, too.\nNo, but I'll be going there in two weeks.\nAnd we're going to Beijing and other places, wherever he'd like to take me. And we'll be spending two days there. And we're going also to Japan and South Korea. And it will be, I think -- hopefully it's historic and positive and we have to solve the North Korea problem. It's a very big problem.\nIt should have never been given to me. This should have been solved long before I came to office, when it would have been easier to solve. But it was given to me and I get it solved. I solve problems. I'm very happy with the way the markets are going, I'm very happy with all of the regulation cuts and all of the things we've done and that's what's driving the markets.\nI am.\nSo I really have it down to two and maybe three people. And I think over the next very short period of time I'll be announcing it. It won't be a big shock. It was sort of interesting, the way it comes out. And you've been talking about the various people on your show, which I watch absolutely almost all the time, even if it means TiVo or whatever device you happen to be using at the time.\nBut no, your show is fantastic. So I'll be announcing this role over the next pretty short period of time.\nDo you have a preference, out of curiosity?\nTell me who your preference is.\nYes.\nNo, but I'd love to hear it. You could even cut it out if you want. You don't have to -- I would love to hear you. I only want that from people I respect.\nI tell you what, she was in my office three days ago. She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it's somebody that I am thinking about. I would certainly think about it. In one way, I have to say --\nNo, no. In one way, I have to say you'd like to make your own mark.\nYou understand that.\nYou like to make your own mark, which is maybe one of the things she's got a little bit against her. But I think she's terrific. We had a great talk. And we're obviously doing very well together, you look at the markets.\nMore than I thought.\nI came in. I said I'm going to fight like hell. I didn't realize -- I had -- it's even more -- more so than I thought. But that's the way it is. And that's good.\nI would say so.\nI would say that also.\nSo the one thing that I really thought -- because I thought I was treated very unfairly by the press during the campaign. --\nAnd when I won, I said, \"The good news is, now they'll start treating me well.\" But they got much worse.\nLou, they put on stories and CNN, and on NBC, and CBS, and ABC, and NBC being an offshoot also with the MSNBC, which is ridiculous. They put on stories that are so false. They have so-called sources that, in my opinion, don't exist. You know, they'll say, \"Sources have said,\" they don't know.\nThey're sitting down, they just -- they make it up. It is so dishonest. It is so fake. And you know, I have come up with some pretty good names for people. There's -- I think one of the best names is -- you know, I've really started this whole fake news thing. Now they've turned it around and then, now they're calling, you know, stories put out by different -- by Facebook fake. And they're fake.\nWhat could be more fake than CBS, and NBC, and ABC, and CNN when you look at some of these stories? And when you look at the amount of negative -- I know when I do well and when I do badly. --\nI know a good story from a bad story. But when you have a really good story and they make it bad, I'll say to my wife, \"Oh, tonight, I'm going to enjoy watching television because I did great, and wait until you see this.\" And then, they put it on and it's like -- oh, that's not so good. They are fake news.\nAnd the good thing about social media is that I have so many millions of people, so many -- I guess, 128 million. You could add up -- you know, you add up all the different platforms -- massive social media. At least I can put out -- it's not that I want to do that. I'd rather not do it. I would love to not do it at all. But at least I can put out the truth. And I can put out the real word. And people agree. And if you look at the level of approval of the -- of media -- of general media --\nif you look at it from the day I started running to now, I'm so proud that I have been able to convince people how fake it is -- because it has taken a nosedive. --\nExcept for your show, of course -- and Sean, and a few of them. Right?\nThere's some very good ones. And I have to say, Fox has treated me fairly. And I don't mean good, but they've treated me fairly. I don't want to be treated good. I just want to be treated fairly.\nWe're getting it done. I will promise you, we're getting it done. And it's happened -- a lot has already happened. Thank you very much, it's an honor.\nThank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lou-dobbs-fox-business-network"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Tokyo, Japan", "Date": "2017-11-06", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much, Shinzo. And this has been a truly enjoyable trip and one where we're accomplishing a lot.\nAnd I agree with you that our relationship is extraordinary. And I agree with you also that there has never been such a close relationship between the leaders of two countries—these two countries, Japan and the United States. So it's been great to be with you, and we'll be spending a lot of time with you over the years.\nMelania and I are deeply grateful for the warm welcome we've received in your remarkable country. And that's what it is: It is a remarkable country. This is a land of incredible history, culture, tradition, and spirit.\nFirst, let me congratulate you on your great success in the recent elections. You won very big and very easily, and I'm not at all surprised. We both share in common and, really, a deep loyalty to our citizens and a deep faith in the destiny of our people and also our people and our countries working together.\nI also want to take a moment to continue sending our thoughts, prayers, and deepest condolences to the victims of the horrific assault on a church in a beautiful area—so sad—Sutherland Springs, Texas. Such a beautiful, wonderful area with incredible people. Who would ever think a thing like this could happen?\nSo I want to send my condolences, the condolences of our First Lady. In tragic times, Americans always pull together. We are always strongest when we are unified. To the wounded and the families of the victims, all of America is praying for you, supporting you, and grieving alongside of you.\nJapan-U.S. Relations\nPrime Minister, I want to thank you and the people of Japan for your friendship. We have so many great things that we can accomplish together, and we are in the process of accomplishing those things.\nIt was a thrill for my daughter Ivanka to be able to participate in the World Assembly for Women and promote women entrepreneurship. Side by side, our two nations are advancing polices to empower women and harness the full potential of our great economies.\nYou were the first foreign leader to visit me shortly after my election, and now it is my pleasure to join you in your homeland to further strengthen the historic ties between our two great nations.\nAs you know, this is my first visit to the Indo-Pacific region as President—been here before—but as President, this has been my first, and it is my first. And I am thrilled that my first stop was with you, great friend. We're going to other countries where I have also developed some great friendships, and we're going to work to straighten a lot of things out, including trade, including military problems. We have a lot of things to work on. But this is a real honor to be with you, Shinzo.\nJapan is a very special place. The Japanese people are thriving, your cities are vibrant, and you've built one of the world's most powerful economies. I don't know if it's as good as ours. I think not. Okay? [Laughter] And we're going to try and keep it that way, but you'll be second.\nAnd yet, for all of its modern splendor, the people of Japan maintain a profound respect for their rich culture, heritage, and traditions. Honoring the past, even as you blaze new trails into the future—very, very strongly looking into the future—is Japan.\nYou demonstrate every day that the respect for history and heritage is the true foundation for progress. Our nations share an enduring bond. America and Japan face many challenges, many opportunities. There are many things we face, but we will be facing them together, in friendship and as allies.\nMost importantly, we're working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea. The regime continued development of its unlawful weapons programs, including its illegal nuclear test and outrageous launches of ballistic missiles directly over Japanese territory, are a threat to the civilized world and international peace and stability. We will not stand for that. The era of strategic patience is over. Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong, but look what's happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now.\nPrime Minister Abe has also shared with me the tragic stories of Japanese young people whom North Korea has abducted over the years. Together, we met with the parents of Megumi Yokota who was abducted as a young girl in 1977. No child should ever be subjected to such cruelty. No parent should ever have to endure 40 years of heartbreak.\nWe also had a young wonderful man in our country, Otto Warmbier. We all know the story of Otto; it's a horrible story, a sad story. And we can't let that happen. We cannot let that happen.\nThe United States of America stands in solidarity with the people of Japan against the North Korean menace. History has proven over and over that strong and free nations will always prevail over tyrants who oppress their people.\nOur powerful and enduring U.S.-Japan alliance includes more than 50,000 members of the United States military stationed right here in Japan. In addition to that, we have 33,000 stationed in South Korea. American and Japanese military personnel train together, work together, and will stand together to defend the security and sovereignty of both of our countries. I want to thank the entire Japanese people for acting as such gracious hosts and strong partners for our men and women in the Armed Forces.\nAmerica is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan. As President of the United States, I am committed to achieving a fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan's markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan. We're working on that; it's something we've all been working on very hard from the very beginning of our meetings.\nAs we continue to pursue closer economic ties, I believe it will create new and exciting opportunities to achieve greater prosperity in both of our nations and to advance new frontiers in science, medicine, and technology. The United States respects and honors Japan's heritage and admires your deep well of perseverance.\nI appreciate very much your acknowledging and stating the fact that the United States economy has done so well since our election on November 8: close to 200 million jobs, the highest stock market in our history. So many different things are happening for the better, including the cutting of massive amounts of regulation, which is one of the reasons that the market is reacting the way it's reacting.\nThis mutual respect for culture and sovereignty will continue to bring our nations closer and closer together and open up new avenues of cooperation and success.\nWell, as far as the North Korean people are concerned, Steve, I think that these are great people. They're under a very repressive regime, and I really think that, ultimately—I can tell you this—that I hope it all works out. It would be better for everybody. Certainly would be better for North Korea, but it would be better for everybody. So we hope that's going to take place.\nAs far as your second question, which is really the first part of your question, I think that mental health is your problem here. This was a very—based on preliminary reports—very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries.\nBut this isn't a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it's a little bit soon to go into it. But fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction; otherwise, it would have been—as bad it was, it would have been much worse.\nBut this is a mental health problem at the highest level. It's a very, very sad event. These are great people, and a very, very sad event. But that's the way I view it. Thank you.\nWell, I think it's very sad. I look at what's happened, and it's a very, very sad thing. Who has ever heard of anything like this? Abducted by a hostile country for purposes of language, for purposes of—could be any number of another reasons. We'll see what happens in terms of the ultimate conclusion.\nBut I did put it in my speech at the United Nations, and many people in Japan were really thrilled that I did because a lot of people thought that the folks we're talking about were forgotten about. Like I say, the \"forgotten people\"—where they were, maybe they're forgotten people—but I can tell you, your great Prime Minister did not forget. He didn't forget at all.\nSo we'll work together and see if we can do something. Now the spotlight is on and perhaps we can have some very good luck, and perhaps the regime itself would send them back. I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back. If he would send them back, that would be the start of something—I think, would be just something very special if they would do that.\nBut I spoke with people who were devastated, and they've been devastated for many years. They think they're alive, but they don't know. Probably makes it even tougher that way. But we'll see what happens. Thank you.\nThank you, Mark. I will say, if I could just take a piece of the Prime Minister's answer, he will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States. He will easily shoot them out of the sky, just like we shot something out of the sky the other day in Saudi Arabia, as you saw. And that was a very rapidly moving missile shot out of the sky. That was a needle in the sky, and it was hit immediately and exploded without damage.\nSo one of the things, I think, that's very important is that the Prime Minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment, by far. He'll be purchasing it from the United States. Whether it's the F-35 fighter, which is the greatest in the world—total stealth—or whether it's missiles of many different kinds, it's a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan and other countries that are likewise purchasing a lot of military equipment from us that, frankly, a year ago and 2 years ago were not.\nAs far as China is concerned, my relationship, as you know, with President Xi is also excellent. I like him a lot. I consider him a friend. He considers me a friend. With that being said, he represents China; I represent the United States. His views are different on things, but they're pretty similar on trade.\nThe problem we have with China is that for decades they've been—you know, it's been a very unfair—let me be very kind to previous administrations—it's been a very unfair trade situation. Our trade deficit is massive. It's hundreds of billions of dollars a year, anywhere from $350 billion to $504 billion, and that doesn't include intellectual property. And we've already started discussions with China because it has to come down. It has to come down. And that has to do with, really, free trade, fair trade, or reciprocal trade.\nAnd frankly, I like reciprocal the best of the group. Because when you explain to somebody that you're going to charge tariffs in order to equalize or you're going to do other things, some people that don't get it; they don't like to hear that. But when you say it's going to be reciprocal—that we're going to charge the same as they're charging us—the people that don't want a 5-percent or a 10-percent tariff say, oh, reciprocal is fair—and that could be 100 percent. So it's much more, Mark, understandable when you talk about reciprocal.\nAnd reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have many countries, not just China or Japan, or so many others that we see. I mean, we have one country that charges us a hundred-percent tax if we sell things into that country, and yet when they sell the same product into our\ncountry, we charge them nothing. Now, I've been against that for a long time, and you will be seeing, we do things about it.\nNow, it also takes a period of time to do that, because, as you know, you have statutory limitations in time. You have to put out notices. You have to wait 90 days before you can put out the next, and then you have to wait another 120 days, and then a hundred—then a 30-day. Now, much of this has already been caught and caught up. Some of it was unnecessary, statutorily.\nBut you will be seeing things of countries that have been treating the United States and the United States worker and companies—because I view the companies not as a company, I view it as an extension of the worker—but that have been treating our companies, our country, and our workers very unfairly.\nYou will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action. It's already started, but most of the legal foundation has now been done. And you're going to see a very big difference, and it's going to happen very soon. Because the United States, by many countries, has been treated very, very unfairly when it comes to trade.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shinzo-abe-japan-tokyo-japan-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in Seoul, South Korea", "Date": "2017-11-07", "Text": "Thank you very much, President Moon. Thank you for honoring us with the invitation to be here today and for the incredibly warm welcome and magnificent ceremony you have given us during our first trip to the very beautiful city of Seoul. Thank you very much.\nMelania and I had a wonderful time having tea with you and First Lady Kim—thank you—at the beautiful Blue House, which I've heard so much about and now get to visit and see firsthand. We're looking forward to joining you for dinner this evening, and we have much to discuss.\nToday the President and I had an opportunity to talk about a range of vital economic and security matters, including our trade relationship and our joint efforts to solve North Korea's grave nuclear threat to South Korea and, indeed, the entire world. This is a worldwide problem.\nThe Republic of Korea is more than a longstanding ally of the United States. We are partners and friends who have fought side by side in a war and, really, worked very hard and prospered toward a great and lasting peace.\nI feel confident that we'll be able to reach a free, fair, and reciprocal trade deal as we renegotiate our current 5-year-old trade document. We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built—and we've built it very much together, and we're very, very proud of it, also, together—but all that we've built in the decade since our soldiers sacrificed side by side in the struggle for freedom. Our alliance is more important than ever to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific region.\nThat is why Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, who is with us today, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, who was here just a short time ago, have all traveled to Seoul in the first year of my administration. It was very important to me that they did.\nNorth Korea's sixth test of a nuclear device and its missile launches are a threat not only to the people of South Korea, but to the people all across our globe. We will together confront North Korea's actions and prevent the North Korean dictator from threatening millions of innocent lives. He is indeed threatening millions and millions of lives so needlessly. North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation, including China and Russia, to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs and live in peace. As the South Korean people know so well, it's time to act with urgency and with great determination. All nations must implement U.N. Security Council regulations and cease trade and business entirely with North Korea. It is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.\nAs we work together to resolve this problem using all available tools short of military action, the United States stands prepared to defend itself and its allies using the full range of our unmatched military capabilities if need be. The crucial U.S. security partnership with South Korea is just one aspect of our enduring alliance. We also share deep partnerships on a range of issues, from cultural exchange to cutting-edge advances in science and medicine, and the very important issue of trade.\nCurrently, we are looking at ways of improving our economic relationship. I would like to thank President Moon for instructing his trade negotiators to work closely with us to quickly pursue a much better deal, a deal that, frankly, has been quite unsuccessful and not very good for the United States.\nIn the more than six decades since we signed our mutual defense treaty, our alliance has grown stronger and deeper. Our two nations symbolize what independent countries can accomplish when they serve the interests of their people, respect the sovereignty of their neighbors, and uphold the rule of law.\nImagine the amazing possibilities for a Korean Peninsula liberated from the threat of nuclear weapons, where all Koreans could enjoy the blessings of liberty and the prosperity that you have achieved right here in South Korea.\nI also want to congratulate President Moon and the South Korean people on hosting the Winter Olympics this upcoming February. It will be a truly spectacular event.\nWhich one? [Laughter]\nWell, I think you know me well enough to know that I don't like talking about whether I see success or not in a case such as this. We like to play our cards a little bit close to the vest. I will say this: that I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing, not only for North Korea, but for humanity all over the world. So there is a lot of reason, a lot of good reason, behind it.\nWith that, yes, I think we're making a lot of progress. I think we're showing great strength. I think they understand we have unparalleled strength. There has never been strength like it. You know we sent three of the largest aircraft carriers in the world, and they're right now positioned. We have a nuclear submarine also positioned. We have many things happening that we hope, we hope—in fact, I'll go a step further, we hope to God—we never have to use.\nWith that being said, I really believe that it makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and to make a deal that's good for the people of North Korea and the people of the world. I do see certain movement, yes. But let's see what happens.\nI don't want to say that.\nI just don't want to say that. You can understand that.\nMargaret, if I may add to that, that the President and I have agreed they'll be buying a tremendous—which they want, and which they need, and everybody thinks it makes a lot of sense. We make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it's planes, whether it's missiles. No matter what it is, we have the greatest military equipment in the world. And South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense. And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.\nBut they'll be ordering billions of dollars' worth of equipment, and we've already approved some of those orders. Okay? Thank you.\nI want to just say that President Xi—where we will be tomorrow, China—has been very helpful. We'll find out how helpful soon. But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with North Korea. We hope that Russia, likewise, will be helpful. We also hope that other countries—and we know for a fact that other countries have already started. And we've had great dialogue with many other countries, as you know, and they're really helping a lot.\nSo if we get China, if we get Russia—and we have some other countries, but we want to get most of them—we think that things will happen, and they could happen very quickly.\nThis is a problem, by the way, that should have been done over the last 25 years, not now. This is not the right time to be doing it, but that's what I've got. That's what I've got. This is a problem that should have been taken care of a long time ago.\nThank you.\nTrying to what?\nWell, you know, you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now. We could let a little time go by, but it's okay. If you feel that that's an appropriate question, even though we're in the heart of South Korea, I will certainly answer your question.\nIf you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference 3 days ago, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him. And I can only say this: If he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that's the way I feel about it.\nNot going to help.\nI mean, you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our Nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster. It's a total disaster. Just remember, if this man didn't have a gun or rifle, you'd be talking about a much worse situation in the great State of Texas. Thank you.\nI'll start off with your second. South Korea—Republic of Korea, Korea—is very important to me. And there will be no skipping South Korea, I can tell you that right now. Plus, I've developed great friendships, not only with the President, but with others, and we're not going to let them down, and they're not going to let us down. Because we're doing a lot for them, to be honest. We're doing a lot for them.\nAs far as the base is concerned, I thought that Humphreys was an incredible military installation. I know what it cost, and it's a lot of money. We actually spent some of that money, and as you know, that money was spent, for the most part, to protect South Korea, not to protect the United States. But some of that money was spent by us.\nThat being said, that was long before my time, and I'm sure I could have built it for a lot less. [Laughter] That's what I do. [Laughter] Thank you.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-moon-jae-south-korea-seoul-south-korea"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Tran Dai Quang of Vietnam in Hanoi, Vietnam", "Date": "2017-11-12", "Text": "Okay.\nYes.\nThat's true.\nWhat I said there—I'm surprised that there's any conflict on this. What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that's very important for somebody to believe. I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.\nAs to whether I believe it or not, I'm with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership. I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies. I've worked with them very strongly. There weren't seventeen as was previously reported; there were actually four. But they were saying there was seventeen; there were actually four. But as currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.\nNow, at the same time, I want to be able—because I think it's very important—to get along with Russia, to get along with China, to get along with Vietnam, to get along with lots of countries, because we have a lot of things we have to solve. And frankly, Russia and China in particular can help us with the North Korea problem, which is one of our truly great problems.\nSo I'm not looking to stand and start arguing with somebody when there's reporters all around and cameras recording and seeing our conversation. I think it was very obvious to everybody. I believe that President Putin really feels—and he feels strongly—that he did not meddle in our election. What he believes is what he believes.\nWhat I believe is that we have to get to work. And I think everybody understood this that heard the answer. We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve North Korea, to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism.\nAnd, you know, people don't realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned. They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently. It's now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken. Those are very important things. And I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world and an asset to our country, not a liability.\nAnd by the way, Hillary Clinton had the reset button. She wanted to get back together with Russia. She even spelled \"reset\" wrong. That's how it started, and then it got worse. President Obama wanted to get along with Russia, but the chemistry wasn't there. Getting along with other nations is a good thing, not a bad thing, believe me. It's a good thing, not a bad thing.\nOkay, second.\nSteve [Steve Holland, Reuters], I think anything is a possibility. Strange things happen in life. That might be a strange thing to happen, but it's certainly a possibility. If that did happen, it would be a good thing for—I can tell you—for North Korea. But it would also be good for lots of other places, and it would be good for the world. So, certainly, it is something that could happen. I don't know that it will, but it would be very, very nice if it did.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-tran-dai-quang-vietnam-hanoi-vietnam-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway", "Date": "2018-01-10", "Text": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I'm honored to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the White House. Madam Prime Minister, it's been a pleasure to host you today. We had some very interesting discussions, as we strengthen the wonderful friendship between our two countries. Norwegians and Americans have so much in common. We're nations made up of strong, pioneering, and adventurous people, to say the least.\nOver a thousand years ago, daring voyagers of Norwegian descent, such as Erik the Red, braved treacherous seas in courageous missions of exploration. Centuries later, during the Second World War, brave Norwegians escaped occupied Norway to fight alongside of Americans and the Allies, including on the beaches of Normandy in 1944. Our friendship builds on this proud and noble history and is rooted in our commitment to confront the problems of today with that same confidence and that same determination, and I think it might even be greater determination.\nWe've just concluded a series of discussions on how we can work together to promote a future of security and world prosperity and also a great future for our respective countries working together.\nThe Prime Minister and I are both committed to strengthening the NATO alliance. Norway has made contributions to the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan—where we are doing very well; it's been turned around—as well as to NATO and NATO's enhanced forward presence in Poland and the Baltic States. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Norwegian people for their participation in these efforts.\nI encourage Norway to follow through on its commitment to meet the 2 percent of GDP defense spending obligation so that together we can confront the full range of threats facing our nations. And I believe Norway will get there quite soon.\nNorway is also a vital and valued member of the campaign to defeat ISIS. Because of us, ISIS has now lost almost 100 percent of the territory it previously held not so long ago in Iraq and in Syria. We're grateful for Norway's civilian assistance efforts and generous humanitarian aid to the region. They've been out there and really doing an incredible job.\nI'm also pleased to share that the economic ties between our two countries are robust and growing. The United States currently has a trade surplus, which is shocking. [Laughter] Can you believe I'm saying we have a surplus? There aren't too many. You're going to have to go back and check your people. [Laughter] But we're getting more and more surpluses all over the world, I will say that. I told that to the Prime Minister.\nBut our two countries are robust and growing. The United States currently has a large contingent of products that we sell and—back and forth with Norway, and one of the big products, of course, is our military equipment. I want to thank the people of Norway for their commitment to fair and reciprocal trade, a word that you're going to hear more and more coming from this administration, and it should have come from other administrations before me. Reciprocal trade, which benefits us all. Free nations are stronger when the trade is fair. And trade has not been overly fair with the United States, but we've had that great relationship with Norway. But remember the word \"reciprocal.\"\nIn November, we started delivering the first F-52s and F-35 fighter jets. We have a total of 52, and they've delivered a number of them already, a little ahead of schedule. It's a $10 billion order.\nNorway also invests about one-third of its sovereign wealth fund in American businesses, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs. They're very big investors in our stock market, and therefore, the Prime Minister thanked me very much, because their market is—you have done very well with your investments in the United States. Right?\nThank you. Norway's commitment to mutually beneficial commerce is a model for other nations. And it really is. It's an amazing country. I'll look forward to forging an even stronger economic relationship between the United States and Norway, growing this record of success with even more investment and more jobs and more job creation.\nWe're also proud of our increasing cooperation on health and health security and also on biodefense, very important to both countries. I commend Prime Minister Solberg's efforts to promote vaccine development and disease prevention. Together, we can save and improve many, many lives. We're working very hard and, in some cases, together, on cures to many ailments.\nPrime Minister Solberg, I want to thank you again for joining us at the White House. For decades, Norwegians and Americans have stood side by side against common threats to our freedom, our security, and to our values. Together, we have fought against fascism and communism and terrorism, and we face threats always together. We're partners.\nOur partnership has advanced peace, cooperation, and respect for human dignity all around the world. Today, we remain united in our efforts to confront shared challenges, to seize new opportunities, and to build a bright and beautiful future for our countries, our people, our children. And I think we're doing very well working together, and we have a newfound friendship.\nSo I want to thank you, and God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you. Thank you.Prime Minister Solberg. We are already number two in NATO after the U.S., in terms of defense spending per capita, and we are making significant investments to further strengthen our defense. And this includes, as the President said, some big buys from American industry: P-8 maritime patrol aircraft from Boeing; 52 F-35 combat aircraft from Lockheed-Martin, our largest, single, public investment ever in Norway. But also, we are buying new submarines and investments in intelligence capabilities and army assets, and—which is important also for our job in the northern parts.\nThe American economy is doing well, and our economic relations are flourishing, and that's to the benefit of both countries. As we discussed in our meeting, for a small country like Norway, it's important for our ability to trade and to invest across borders that we have fair trade and that we have multilateral trade systems also. And we think it's important for our future.\nNorwegian investments and Norwegian companies support close to half a million jobs of—in the United States. And through our government pension funds, substantial revenues from our oil sectors are being investment—invested in U.S. assets.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nOkay, some questions. How about Sarah Westwood? Where is Sarah? Sarah, thank you. Washington Examiner.\nThat's right.\nNo. It's got to include the wall. We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety. We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in. I would imagine that the people in the room, both Democrat and Republican, I really believe they're going to come up with a solution to the DACA problem—which has been going on for a long time—and maybe, beyond that, immigration as a whole.\nBut any solution has to include the wall, because without the wall, it all doesn't work. You could look at other instances. Look at what happened in Israel. They put up the wall; they solved the—a very major problem.\nWe need the wall. We have to have the wall for security purposes. Security is number one. And so the answer is, have to have the wall. Thank you.\nAnd please.\nWhen you say \"the big war,\" you're saying what? Say it.\nRight.\nWell, maybe he knows something that I don't know, okay? [Laughter] I would say this——\nI would say this: We have a very, very powerful military. We're getting more powerful by the month, by the day. We're ordering a lot of the equipment that you're ordering. We're ordering it, but in larger amounts, to put it mildly. We are building up our military to a point that we've never been before. We're also—we were very much weakened over the last long period of time, but not with me.\nNo, I don't expect that. I think we're going to have—because of strength—peace through strength. I think we're going to have a long period of peace. I hope we do. We have certainly problems with North Korea, but a lot of good talks are going on right now, a lot of good energy. I see a lot of good energy. I like it very much, what I'm seeing.\nI just spoke this morning with the—as you know, with the President—President Moon of South Korea. He had some really great meetings. His representatives had a great, great meeting. And I had some very good feedback from that. So hopefully, a lot of good things are going to work out. No, I think that we will have peace through strength. Our military will be stronger than it ever was in a very short period of time. And that's my opinion. That's not the general's opinion, but I think my opinion counts more right now. [Laughter] Thank you.\nYes. And, Sarah [Sarah Westwood, Washington Examiner], did you have a question? You were about to ask a question? Did you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nWell, I will say this: There is collusion, but it's really with the Democrats and the Russians, far more than it is with the Republicans and the Russians. So the witch hunt continues.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News], go ahead.\nWell, again, John, there has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians, or Trump and Russians. No collusion. When I watch you interviewing all the people leaving their committees—I mean, the Democrats are all running for office, and they're trying to say this, that. But bottom line, they all say there's no collusion. And there is no collusion.\nAnd when you talk about interviews, Hillary Clinton had an interview where she wasn't sworn in, she wasn't given the oath, they didn't take notes, they didn't record, and it was done on the Fourth of July weekend. That's perhaps ridiculous, and a lot of people looked upon that as being a very serious breach. And it really was.\nBut again, I'll speak to attorneys. I can only say this: There was absolutely no collusion. Everybody knows it. Every committee—I've been in office now for 11 months. For 11 months, they've had this phony cloud over this administration, over our Government. And it has hurt our Government. It does hurt our Government.\nIt's a Democrat hoax that was brought up as an excuse for losing an election that, frankly, the Democrats should have won because they have such a tremendous advantage in the electoral college. So it was brought up for that reason. But it has been determined that there is no collusion and by virtually everybody. So we'll see what happens.\nWe'll see what happens.\nI mean, certainly, I'll see what happens. But when they have no collusion, and nobody has found any collusion at any level, it seems unlikely that you'd even have an interview.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/U.S. Foreign Policy\nJust to add to the answer, I think it is much better to work with Russia. It's very much better, having to do with North Korea, where we currently have a problem that should have never been my problem; this should have been a problem solved many years ago when it was much less dangerous. But it was given to me, along with a big mess of other things.\nBut I will say this: I am for massive oil and gas and everything else and a lot of energy. Putin can't love that. I am for the strongest military that the United States ever had. Putin can't love that. But Hillary was not for a strong military. And Hillary, my opponent, was for windmills, and she was for other types of energy that don't have the same capacities, at this moment, certainly.\nSo I just want to say that it's a lot better to work with other countries. We're working with China on North Korea. We're working with various other countries, and I think we're doing very well. We had a great talk—as you know, and as you reported—we had a great talk this morning with President Moon, and I think that a lot of good things are happening. We're going to see what happens.\nBut working with other countries, whether it's Russia or China or India or any of the countries that surround this world and encompass this world, that's a good thing, John; that's not a bad thing. That's very good thing, okay?\nOkay, go ahead.\nWell, it wasn't a major topic, I must tell you. We talked about other things, including mostly trade. But I will say that the Paris Agreement, as drawn and as we signed, was very unfair to the United States. It put great penalties on us. It made it very difficult for us to deal, in terms of business. It took away a lot of our asset values.\nWe are a country rich in gas and coal and oil and lots of other things, and there was a tremendous penalty for using it. It hurt our businesses. According to some estimates, we would have had to close businesses in order to qualify by 2025. Whereas, as an example, China, by 2030—they don't kick in until 2030. Russia, someplace in the mid-1990s—that was their standard, and that was never a good standard, because that was a dirty standard for the environment.\nIt treated the United States very unfairly, and frankly, it's an agreement that I have no problem with, but I had a problem with the agreement that they signed, because as usual, they made a bad deal.\nSo we could conceivably go back in, but I say this: We are very strong on the environment. I feel very strongly about the environment. Our EPA and our EPA commissioners are very, very powerful in the sense that they want to have clean water, clean air, but we also want businesses that can compete. And the Paris accord really would have taken away our competitive edge. And we're not going to let that happen. I'm not going to let it happen.\nIt's true.\nOne of the great assets of Norway is a thing called water. And they have tremendous hydropower—tremendous. In fact, most of your energy or your electricity is produced by hydro. I wish we'd do some of that. [Laughter] But hydropower is fantastic, and it's a great asset that you have.\nThank you very much. Great honor. Thank you.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-erna-solberg-norway"}
{"Title": "Interview with the Wall Street Journal", "Date": "2018-01-11", "Text": "Sure.\nWell, I think more than anything else it's the great success that we've had in the last year. And you know if you remember the first quarter was a very low GDP, when Obama's last quarter. It was the slowest growing recovery, a very minor recovery, but it's the worst recovery they've had since the Great Depression. And our country was headed in the wrong direction.\nWe were going down, we were going down a long way. I believe if the opposing party got in, I believe the stock market would have fallen 50 percent instead of gone up to the number it's gone up. The regulations were choking people, choking companies like never before. It was out of control and they were only going to get worse.\nThe cutting of regulation and all of the many things that we've done, including being a cheerleader for the country—and perhaps that's part of the reason I'm going to Davos also—but being a cheerleader for the country. Yesterday it was announced that Toyota is coming in with a very big plant in Alabama. It's going to cost—they're going to spend billions of dollars, four thousand jobs, create 300,000 cars a year within the country, which is what I want.\nPrime Minister Abe told me about it, I pressed him very hard. I said, 'We got to get your companies building here. We don't want a building in Japan; we want to build them here. We have a lot of plants opening, car plants opening; we have a lot of things happening that would've never happened under the Democrats.\nAnd I just think I want to tell the story of what's happening in the United States. A lot of tremendous things are happening in the United States, including the fact that you can now live without being strangled by regulation. You people actually wrote one of the best stories that I've ever seen on regulation; you said more than any president in history.\nThat was the full pager, that wasn't...\n...I mean I actually read it because I've never seen a full page—it's actually a full page article.\nBut, it was a full pager and essentially said there's never been a president that's been anywhere close on regulation. And you know, just so we understand. We need regulation, but we don't need 19 different roadblocks getting to the same place and that's what we had. And we have a long way to go, we're cutting actually quite a bit of additional regulation. We're looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we'll have something on that.\nI think it's going to be bipartisan and we're looking at other things and the bottom line is that the spirit in the country—you saw small business yesterday came out with the most enthusiastic they've ever been in the history of the report, which is a very old report.\nBusiness, generally, manufacturing the same thing, but we have companies pouring back into this country and you saw that yesterday with Toyota.\nI'm not sure that markets would dip; I think that markets would—I can tell you I'm not sure about world markets, but I can tell you I think the American market would go up if I terminated Nafta and renegotiated a new deal.\nWe are—when I campaigned I said we'll either renegotiate Nafta or I'll terminate it.\nAnd nothing's changed, I have fulfilled many of my campaign promises. One of the promises that you know is being very seriously negotiated right now is the wall and the wall will happen. And if you look—point, after point, after point—now we've had some turns. You always have to have flexibility. As an example, we've been much tougher on China, but not nearly as tough as I would be, but they are helping us a lot with North Korea.\nAnd you see in North Korea what's happening with North Korea all of a sudden. China's been helping us a lot, so you can veer a little bit differently, but for the most part everything I've said I've done.\nIf we don't make the right deal, I will terminate Nafta. OK?\nNow, do I want to? No, I'd rather leave it, but I feel that if that if—you know, the United States has been treated very, very badly. That has been a terrible agreement for us, and if we don't make a good deal for our country—we lose $71 billion in trade deficits with Mexico. We lose $17 billion with Canada. If we don't make a fair deal for the United States and the United States taxpayer, then I will terminate it.\nNo, but, you know, I'm leaving it a little flexible because they have an election coming up. So I understand a lot of things are hard to negotiate prior to an election. They have an election coming up fairly shortly, and I understand that that makes it a little bit difficult for them, and I'm not looking to make the other side—so we'll either make a deal or—there's no rush, but I will say that if we don't make a fair deal for this country, a Trump deal, then we're not going to have—then we're going to have a—I will terminate.\nWith that being said, I would rather be able to negotiate. We've made a lot of headway. We're moving along nicely. Bob Lighthizer and others are working very hard, and we'll see what happens.\nBut tremendous numbers of, you talk about auto plants like yesterday, but how about all the plants that have been taken out of this country and moved to Mexico. Like taking candy from a baby. No, I won't let that happen.\nRight.\nNot helpful enough, but they've been very helpful. Let's put it this way, they've done more for me than they ever have for any American president. They still haven't done enough. But they've done more for me than they have, by far, for any—I have a very good relationship with President Xi. I like him. He likes me. We have a great chemistry together. He's—China has done far more for us than they ever have for any American president. With that being said, it's not enough. They have to do more.\nFor instance, at the very beginning, you know Obama felt—President Obama felt it was his biggest problem is North Korea. He said that openly. He said that to me, but he said that openly. It is a big problem, and they should not have left me with that problem. That should have been a problem that was solved by Obama, or Bush, or Clinton or anybody, because the longer it went, the worse, the more difficult the problem got. This should not have been a problem left on my desk, but it is, and I get things solved. And one way or the other, that problem is going to be solved.\nChina has been helping us, and I appreciate the help, but they can do much more.\nSay it again?\nYou're the first one that's asked that question. No, I don't think anybody thinks that I'm bending. I think that people that, if anything, I'm being too tough.\nNo, I think it's inappropriate to have the Olympics, have millions of people going to the Olympics hopefully, have North Korea going to the Olympics, and we're having exercises on the beach. No, I think that it doesn't—I think it sends a good message to North Korea, not a bad message. I think it would be totally inappropriate to do that during the Olympics.\nI'll let you know in—within the next 12 months, OK, Mike?\nI will let you know. But if I were them I would try. But the difference is I'm president; other people aren't. And I know more about wedges than any human being that's ever lived, but I'll let you know. But I'll tell you, you know, when you talk about driving a wedge, we also have a thing called trade. And South Korea—brilliantly makes—we have a trade deficit with South Korea of $31 billion a year. That's a pretty strong bargaining chip to me.\nWith that being said, President Xi has been extremely generous with what he's said, I like him a lot. I have a great relationship with him, as you know I have a great relationship with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and I probably have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.\nI have relationships with people, I think you people are surprised.\nI don't want to comment on it—I don't want to comment, I'm not saying I have or I haven't. But I just don't—\nSure, you see that a lot with me and then all of a sudden somebody's my best friend. I could give you 20 examples. You give me 30. I'm a very flexible person.\nGetting close.\nNo but it's getting close. They—want, I feel, you know, I have great feeling for DACA. I think that we should be able to do something with DACA. I think it's foolish if we don't, they've been here a long time, they're no longer children, you know. People talk of them as children, I mean some are 41 years old and older. But some are in their teens, and late teens, but nevertheless I think we should do something with DACA and I think we should do something to help people.\nIt wasn't their fault, their parents came in, it wasn't their fault. So we're in the process of trying to work something out. I hope we can do it. I don't think it has to take that long. The lottery system is a disaster, we have to get rid of the lottery system. The—as you know chain is—chain migration is a horrible situation. You've seen the ads, you've seen everything, you know all about chain.\nThis person on the west side that killed eight people and badly, you heard me say yesterday, badly, badly wounded about 12. I mean people losing arms and legs—nobody even talks about that. But they say killed eight and that's it. I mean you have people—ones walking around without—missing two legs. And the person was running to stay in shape and now he's missing two legs. Think of it.\nBut this person, who should've never been allowed into this country, came in through the lottery. When they interviewed his neighborhood, they say he was horrible. You'd say good morning to him and he'd start cursing at you. They didn't want him so they sent him through the lottery, you know, congratulations United States.\nSo the lottery has to end, chain migration—he brought in they say 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why? And I honestly think that the Democrats are with us on that. We'll find out. I mean who wouldn't be? Who wouldn't be? Unless it's somebody that didn't love our country, and the Democrats love our country. We have different views but the Democrats love our country.\nSo yeah, I think, Michael, I think we have a good chance to make a deal. We have to have a wall. We don't have a wall, we're not doing the deal.\nLet me, let me tell you something about the wall. So I've always said we have to have a wall. I've also said Mexico's got to pay for it—sometimes you know on occasion, I'd add who's going to pay for it? Mexico. Well they will pay for it, OK? There are many forms of payment. I could name 10 right now. There are many forms of payment, I didn't say how.\nThey can pay for it through, as an example, they can pay for it indirectly through Nafta. OK? You know, we make a good deal on Nafta, say I'm going to take a small percentage of that money and it's going to go toward the wall. Guess what? Mexico's paying. Now Mexico may not want to make the Nafta deal and which is OK, then I'll terminate Nafta...which I think would be frankly a positive for our country. I don't think it's a positive for Mexico, I don't think it's a positive for the world. But it's a positive for our country because I'd make a much better deal. There is no deal that I can make on Nafta that's as good as if I terminate Nafta and make a new deal. OK? But I feel that we have a chance of making a reasonable deal, the way it is now.\nThe other thing...so the wall. The wall's never meant to be 2,100 miles long. We have mountains that are far better than a wall, we have violent rivers that nobody goes near, we have areas...\nBut, you don't need a wall where you have a natural barrier that's far greater than any wall you could build, OK? Because somebody said oh, he's going to make the wall smaller. I'm not going to make it smaller. The wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it. And there are some areas that are far greater than any wall we could build.\nSo, maybe someday somebody could make that clear, Sarah, will you make that clear please?\nI saw on television, Donald Trump is going to make the wall smaller; no, the wall's identical. The other thing about the wall is we've spent a great deal of time with the Border Patrol and with the ICE agents and they know this stuff better than anybody, they're unbelievable.\nThey both endorsed me, the only time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate, OK? And they endorsed us unanimously. I had meetings with them, they need see-through. So, we need a form of fence or window. I said why you need that—makes so much sense? They said because we have to see who's on the other side.\nIf you have a wall this thick and it's solid concrete from ground to 32 feet high which is a high wall, much higher than people planned. You go 32 feet up and you don't know who's over here. You're here, you've got the wall and there's some other people here.\nIf you don't know who's there, you've got a problem.\nI don't have to because the wall is the same wall I've always talked about. I can understand why I have to have see-through.\nIf I'm standing here, I want to be able to see 200 yards out. I want to be able to see, I don't want to have a piece of concrete that I can't see.\nNow on the wall we have cameras and we have highly sophisticated equipment, but the wall—the Border Patrol tells me the other way's more expensive. It's not less expensive. We have to have vision through the wall.\nThis is going to be state of the art wall; this will be state of the art. But, I can fully understand why you'd have to have vision. I'd like to be able to see three or four hundred yards instead of we're at a wall we have no idea who's on the other side. Does this make sense or am I just wasting my time.\nI never said the wall's going to be two thousand, but there are—there is a vast amount of territory where nobody comes through.\nRight.\nWell, I'm not talking amnesty at all. I'm not talking amnesty at all, that's the other thing. No, I think my base is with me. My base feels that these 800 thousand young people should not be thrown out of the country, OK? My base is with me and now\nI you know; and I think my base actually gets bigger.\nAnd I'm not doing it because of the base or anything else, I'm doing it from the standpoint of heart, I'm doing it from the standpoint of common sense. I'm doing it from another standpoint too. You have a lot of people of those 800, they work hard, they have jobs. We need workers in this country; we need people to come in and work because I have a lot of companies moving in.\nAnd I'm getting a lot of questions like we want to move to Wisconsin, we wanted—like Wisconsin, I have Foxconn coming to Wisconsin; that's my deal. You know the head of Foxconn, you know he's a friend of mine. He's still only moving there because of me.\nAnd the governor has been fantastic.\nThe governor of Wisconsin has been fantastic in their presentations and everything else. But I'm the one who got them to look at it. Now we need people because they're going to have thousands of people working it's going to be a—you know—that's—that's the company that makes the Apple iPhone.\nIs that—they're going to build them here, they're going to build other things here too.\nWe need people so we have to be a little bit flexible. I don't want to be so—I've had another pledge that I'm going to move companies back into this country. I don't want to make it so tough that they can't come back in.\nWould you say that's a correct statement, Gary, we have to have people.\nThat's a different discussion.\nThat's comprehensive—well, if we could do that, that's fine. I don't know that that's going to be possible.\nThere's a lot of—there's a lot of—there's a big difference—first of all, there's a big difference between DACA and Dreamers, OK?\nDreamers are different. And I want American kids to be Dreamers also, by the way. I want American kids to be Dreamers also.\nBut there's a big difference between DACA and Dreamers. And a lot of times when I was with certain Democrats they kept using the word dreamer. I said, \"Please, use the word DACA.\" You know it's a totally different word.\nOK, people think they're interchangeable, but they're not.\nSo—I—I think we have a very good chance of making a deal on DACA, I would like to be able to do it; I think that the people that are Trump supporters agree with me on it. I would never do it without a wall, the wall is the wall and it's the same wall that we're always talking about. It's—you know, wherever we need, we don't need it where you have mountains; you don't need it where you have rivers and—you know, vicious rivers.\nSo—so we have sort of natural barriers.\nAnd, obviously, we never intended [inaudible].\nYeah, be really clear, I'd like to—because I love The Wall Street Journal. I hope that you guys are clear. OK.\nNo, no I support the idea of discussing it.\nAnd, maybe, it's possible to get it. You know, that's what I do, I make deals. Despite what you read with—by these people that don't know me, that were never interviewed by—to me, you know.\nThe man with the three hour interview, he spent three hours—the man who said he spent three hours in the Oval Office who I never met once in the White House. OK, you know—despite all these characters that are—that's something you can talk about, is the libel laws, because we've got to increase our libel laws so when people make misstatements, like yourselves, but when people make misstatements somebody has some, you know, recourse.\nYeah, I do, I would—I would say—I don't know that I'll be able to get it though—but I think that when somebody makes false statements and libelous statements, whether it's in a book or a newspaper or anything else. When they have phony sources, when the sources don't exist, yeah I think they should have a liability.\nI don't know if Congress has the guts to do that.\nI would like to see that. Yeah, I'd like to be able to—look, nobody gets more false press than I do. Nobody—nobody gets—nobody comes close. In history—in the history of this country nobody's gotten more false press and you guys all know it.\nThey dislike me, the liberal media dislikes me. I mean I watch people—I was always the best at what I did, I was the—I was, you know, I went to the—I went to the Wharton School of Finance, did well. I went out, I—I started in Brooklyn, in a Brooklyn office with my father, I became one of the most successful real-estate developers, one of the most successful business people. I created maybe the greatest brand.\nI then go into, in addition to that, part-time, like five percent a week, I open up a television show. As you know, the Apprentice on many evenings was the number one show on all of television, a tremendous success. It went on for 12 years, a tremendous success. They wanted to sign me for another three years and I said, no, I can't do that.\nThat's one of the reasons NBC hates me so much. NBC hates me so much they wanted—they were desperate to sign me for—for three more years.\nJust—and so—so I was successful, successful, successful. I was always the best athlete, people don't know that. But I was successful at everything I ever did and then I run for president, first time—first time, not three times, not six times. I ran for president first time and lo and behold, I win. And then people say oh, is he a smart person? I'm smarter than all of them put together, but they can't admit it. They had a bad year.\nYes, I do. I feel betrayed because you're not supposed to do that, but I have many people that work for me who were far more important than Steve, right there.\nAnd others, I mean I could take you around to the back and I could show you many people, If you don't—and some of them you wouldn't know their names so [inaudible]. Steve was—I always liked Steve, but Steve became very ineffective because he was such a lightning rod.\nAnd Steve, in the end I fired Steve.\nYou never know, you know again, the word—– I don't know what the word permanent means, OK? I never know what the word permanent means. We'll see what happens, but Steve had nothing to do with my win. Well, certainly very little.\nSteve's greatest asset is he was able to convince a corrupt media that he was responsible for my win. Hope, just out of curiosity, you were there from day one. What do you think Steve in a percentage had to do with my victory?\nI mean he was there. Corey [Lewandowski] had more to do with it.\nDavid had more to do with it. Many people— I mean, there were many people—it's a little before Sarah's time. If you were here, you would have had more to do with it. No, I talked to Steve very little; I didn't know Steve well, believe it or not. They made it sound like—I mean when that guy wrote the book about Steve.\nDon't forget, I had vanquished 17 governors, senators plus a couple of very smart people, like Ben and Carly and others. I had vanquished them easily—easily. I won every debate based on the polls. You know, they do polls—seven or eight polls. Time Magazine—Time Magazine's not a fan of mine.\nDrudge, Time Magazine they have seven polls. I don't think, I may be wrong—I don't think you'll find one poll that I ever lost in any of the 14, 15 debates. Including the presidential debate, you know with her, the three. Steve Bannon, I just wish him well...\n...but he had nothing to do with my—he was involved, but he had nothing to do with our victory. And he was there two months—what was it two months after? So, I beat 17 people, OK? So, Michael, you know politics, perhaps better than me.\nYou've been doing it longer, OK? That's the other thing I've only been doing this for two years, two and a half years, OK? You know, it's pretty good. When they said Jeb Bush was off his game; Trump killed him in the debate. Jeb was off his game because he hasn't been governor now. He's been out of politics for eight years. Oh, really? I've been out of politics for—I was never in politics.\nSo, sort of interesting, but when I won against the 17 people, you can't then say that oh, gee, somebody comes in two months after I won, and he gives me new policy, new idea. I can't change those ideas, those ideas are wedded.\nWhat he said about my son is horrible. My son had a brief meeting based on the fact that he thought whatever he thought. And he—somebody said bad stuff on an opponent. I don't know of one politician in Washington—if you're a politician and somebody called up that they have information on your opponent that might be negative.\nI'm not sure, but I don't think there's one politician in all of Washington that would not take that would not take that meeting, number one. Number two, after the meeting was over nothing happened. In other words, it wasn't like OK let's meet again in a month and let's plan out the—nothing happened, it was a dead meeting.\nNo, I never did; I never knew about it.\nOh I do?\nYes.\nNo, I think—I just want them to—look, all I see of these Democrats, like Adam Schiff —it's all he does, he'll have a meeting, and then he'll leave, and he'll call up the meeting, and then I'll have a meeting and then he'll leave. He left meetings where people are being interviewed, and then all of a sudden they say a story about what's going on inside the meetings.\nIt's probably illegal, what he's doing. But the Democrats know it's a hoax. It's an excuse for them having lost the election. They know it's a hoax. And yet, they are milking it to a fare-thee-well and I think the Republicans— although I will say that over the last month the Republicans have started to get very tough. Because they realize there's no collusion whatsoever. There's no collusion.\nI hope so. Hey, look, I got elected president. I won easily, 306 or 304, depending on your definition, to 223. I won a race that should never be won by a Republican because it's so stacked in the Democrats' favor. I mean, if you figure California, New York, and Illinois, you start off with losing that—you have to run the entire East Coast and every— and the entire Midwest.\nI won an election that should never be won, because the Electoral College is far harder to win than the popular vote. The popular vote, for me, would have been much easier.\nNo, I just want them to be tough, be strong. I also think that primary collusion, because there was no collusion on our side, the collusion was on the Democrat side with the Russians. And what went on with the FBI, where a man is tweeting to his lover that if she loses, we'll essentially go back to the—we'll go to the insurance policy, which is—if they lose, we'll go to phase 2, and we'll get this guy out of office.\nI mean, this is the FBI we're talking about. I think that is—that is treason. See, that's treason right there.\nBy the way, that's a treasonous act. What he tweeted to his lover is a treasonous act.\nLook, there has never been in the history of this country an administration that, number one, did nothing wrong, and number two, was more open with a special counsel. We have—my lawyers are very good people. We made a decision right at the beginning. And it wasn't their original idea. They figured, like, well, we'll fight this [inaudible].\nAfter they looked at all the letters, all the facts, every email, they saw nothing. They said, \"We should be open.\" There has never been a more— they said, \"You never did anything wrong.\" To be honest, they probably were surprised, OK? As most lawyers would be.\nThey said, \"You never did anything wrong.\"\nAnd they said, and I agree with them, \"We should be upfront, give them a\"—we gave them everything.\nThere has never been, in the history—in the history of an administration anybody that was more open than we were. You understand that?\nWe gave them everything. We didn't go to court and say, \"You can't have this document, you can't have\"—and what we gave them showed—I never got a phone call from Russia. I didn't have a tweet. I didn't have a—I had nothing. I didn't have an email. I didn't have a meeting. I didn't have—did I have one meeting with—about Russia? And...\nWell allow—let me—[inaudible]. So, they make up a crime, and the crime doesn't exist. And then they say obstruction. And how could there be obstruction on firing Comey? When the man who's in charge of it wrote a letter that was far stronger than anything I would have written. He was in charge—Deputy Rosenstein. He wrote a letter that's far stronger than even what I say.\nAnd here's another thing. A friend of mine brought this up the other day. Comey. Comey has proven to be a liar and a leaker. Proven. He tries to act like a choir boy. What he did with Hillary Clinton is outrageous. He saved her life, because all of those charges—I call it \"Comey one, two, and three,\" all of those charges and Comey won, she was guilty of. She should have been taken out of the campaign and been on trial.\nHe didn't do that. He saved her life. But here's the way you look at Comey. Everybody hated Comey, and Comey—by the way, the FBI, say what you want, go back to look at the day around Hillary—the FBI was in turmoil. Everybody hated Comey. The Democrats wanted him fired. Everybody wanted him out. You look at what Schumer said about him, you look at what everybody said. As soon as I fired him they said, \"oh, he's wonderful—he's wonderful, how could you do that.\"\nSo there's no—you have a no-crime that was created, you have a phony crime and then they talk about obstruction. And how can they talk about obstruction when I was the most open person, in history, in terms of—there's never been a paper we didn't give them, there's never been a question we didn't answer.\nNow, I could of done it differently. I've been, you know, pretty successful in the courts over the years, I've been a very successful person, you can check—USA Today said, \"he does great in the courts,\" OK?\nThey don't want to talk about that—they don't want to talk about the biggest tax bill [inaudible].\nOK, all right, well we'll do as much as we can.\nSo, just to finish, everybody wanted Comey fired. And then, when I fired, I never forget, when I fired, all these people that had just said, \"You've got fire Comey\", they said, \"oh, he just fired Comey.\" Well now they're—the—on the other side, they're Democrats. So all of a sudden they change.\nAll you have to do is take a look, seriously—take a look at all these people, they all wanted him fired. And the FBI was a mess. When he announced the Hillary Clinton fiasco where she was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty and then where they did the interview with no tape recorder, with no swearing in, with no this, with no that—you know the story.\nBut take a look at all of these people that became critics of my firing, they all wanted him fired. And they wanted him fired until I said, \"he's fired.\" But the deputy, Rosenstein, who is in charge, he wrote a letter that was possibly or probably stronger than anything I would have written or did write.\nOf course there was no obstruction—excuse me. Of course there was no obstruction. But there was no crime. So now they're saying, could there be—now, I haven't even heard that they're looking at obstruct—I don't know that they're looking at obstruction.\nBut how can you—I'm sorry, this is the most open dialogue ever, I've given everything, number one. That's not obstruction.\nThe other thing is, everybody wanted Comey fired. And, another thing, and this is just a few, Comey has proven to be a leaker and a liar and, if anything, I should get credit for firing him because it turned out I was right because many thing have been found out about Comey that—I mean, I should be given credit for having great insight because many things have been found out about Comey that would never have been found out if I didn't fire him.\nBut just so you understand...\n...The deputy attorney general, who's in charge of the case, wanted—all you have to do is read his letter. So that's— there's no obstruction there.\nYeah, go ahead.\nI do?\nOK, get me a list of those people.\nI'll see the level of it.\nI do enjoy this, actually.\nI do ask you this, treat me fairly.\nWe'll do it—every month we'll do one of these. But—because I do respect and I love and I think [WSJ editor in chief] Gerard [Baker]—I always call him the most elegant debate—I thought it was the best debate, maybe because I like that one good from my standpoint.\nBut I thought he was very elegant. I always say, \"You're the elegant host.\"\nI went through some that weren't so elegant. But all I'm asking is one thing, you know what I'm saying, it's very easy, treat me fairly.\nReady? Comprehensive immigration reform is a far step from DACA. I am always open to discussing everything but that doesn't mean we're going to get anywhere close to getting it done.\nI'd love to get something done if it's appropriate. But there's no—I think we will get DACA, I really believe we're getting close to DACA and I'm dealing with some great people on the Democrat side. I'm dealing with some people that I really have gotten to like.\nAnd I really believe they have good intention. After we're finished with DACA, assuming that gets done, I would certainly be open to discussing—you know, the comprehensive immigration. I don't know that we'll be able to make a deal on that one.\nYou understand what I mean.\nSo that's a very different—very different topic.\nWell I think we're going to start with infrastructure. We're very far down the line. Gary [Cohn] actually met with Elizabeth Warren yesterday and I heard, actually, had a very good conversation. My team met—Gary, you had a whole group of people—and they had a good conversation. We'll start with infrastructure and we'll see. If we do infrastructure I think that has to be bipartisan—and I think it will be. I think we'll have a lot of Democrat support.\nAnd I think with welfare reform that will have to be bipartisan. You know, we only have a majority of one and unless we get more Republicans in the next election or the next two elections we won't be able to do that and as Republicans we're going to have to have a bipartisan.\nSo, if we do welfare reform it's going to have to be bipartisan.\nWell, I'd rather talk to you about that later because honestly, we're doing infrastructure first; OK? We'll do that again.\nIt's going to be a combination of public/private which is now the new hot topic. We'll be putting up approximately $200 billion. It could be as much as $1.8 trillion spent. We have many, many, wealthy countries, some of whom our country made wealthy, but we have many countries, any people that really want to put up tremendous amounts of money for the infrastructure. That gets it built faster, gets it built better, gets it built on time, on budget and the United States won't be putting up all of the money.\nThe $200 billion?\nWell, that's not a large amount. I mean—think of this—I hate to say it but it's not my fault and I did not want to go into Iraq, by the way. But as of two months ago we're into the Middle East for $7 trillion. We made a lot of headway in the Middle East, by the way. I've knocked out ISIS and Syria and Iraq and all but— and we're doing well in Afghanistan for the first time ever. But you'll see the results over the next three or four months like you won't believe.\nNo, never out of the military. No—no, no. Nothing comes out of the military. We're making the military strong, again. Just the opposite—we're building the military budget very substantially; you know that.\nNo. This will be—this will be money that we will find. There's a lot of places to find $200 billion. There are not a lot of places to find $1.8 trillion. I see Gary shaking his head, yes; correct? $200 billion sounds like a lot but relative to what we're talking about it's a number that we can easily handle.\nWhereas again people will come in and put up vast amounts of money. They will supervise the projects, they will make sure they get built on time, on budget—or below budget which is even better. And so, what we're talking about is about $200 billion. And, Gary, am I right when I say $1.7 trillion to $1.8 trillion?\nApproximately—so it will be actually $1.8 trillion of investment in our infrastructure which will largely rebuild our infrastructure.\nThat will include bridges, roadways, tunnels; it will include many things. One of the things we're doing separate of that will be air-traffic control. Our air-traffic control is from a different planet. It's horrible. It's a horrible mess.\nOur air-traffic control doesn't work. They have spent billions and billions of dollars on it over the last seven years. Billions and it's worthless. They had many different contractors doing many different locations using all different computers and computer companies. And when they hooked it up it didn't work. So, I'm good at that stuff—we'll fix it.\nGo ahead.\nThe tax bill has turned out to be far greater than we ever anticipated.\nIt's selling itself, Michael. Michael, it's selling itself.\nOne thing nobody anticipated was that these companies would come in and pay all of this money to the employees—to millions and millions of employees. And AT&T started it, but it was picked up by Comcast and another one.\nMany are announcing today—and the ones that aren't announcing you know what's happening? The employees are going, what about us? Did you forget us—to the ones that—that was never anticipated. That was just one of the many benefits. You know this bill—and I said from the beginning this bill will be so good—and the Democrats are very concerned. They're very concerned. This bill has turned out to be even better than we thought. It's really having a big—and I'm also hearing a lot of people are bringing money back in. You know, the $4 trillion that we're talking about or whatever it may be. Nobody even knows what it is, but it's a big number.\nWe're going to be very careful. We're going to be very, very, careful about Russia—and about anybody else, by the way.\nWe are absolutely—at the appropriate time and first of all we're working on different solutions.\nAnd as you know the last election was not affected in terms of votes—and I think you do understand that everybody—even the Democrats agree to that—a lot of people don't write it. But we are looking at all sorts of fail-safes and we are going to make sure that no country including Russia can have anything to do with the result of the midterms or any other election; OK? That's what our country is all about.\nYeah, Rex and I are getting along very well.\nI don't know, Gary, are you staying on?\nOh, I know it's the time. But look, hey, Gary may leave and Rex may leave but I don't anticipate it. I hope Gary stays and we'll see.\nYou know what? I like him. I like him. I like them all.\nWe'll find out. But people do leave. You guys may leave The Wall Street Journal, right?\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-the-wall-street-journal-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Reporters on Testifying Under Oath to Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III", "Date": "2018-01-24", "Text": "I'm looking forward to it, actually.\nThere's been no collusion whatsoever. There's no obstruction whatsoever. And I'm looking forward to it. I do worry when I look at all of the things that you people don't report about, with what's happening. If you take a look at, you know, the five months' worth of missing texts — that's a lot of missing texts. And as I said yesterday, that's prime time.\nSo you do sort of look at that and say, \"What's going on?\" You do look at certain texts where they talk about insurance policies or insurance where they say the kinds of things they're saying, you gotta be concerned. But I would love to do that, and I'd like to do it as soon as possible.\nI don't know, no. I guess you're talking about two or three weeks, but I would love to do it.\nYou know, again, it's — I have to say — subject to my lawyers and all of that — but I would love to do it.\nYou mean like Hillary did it under — who said that?\nOh.\nOh you said it. You did say it. You say a lot. Did Hillary do it under oath?\nI think you have an idea. Don't you have an idea?\nWait, wait, wait. Do you not have an idea? Do you really not have an idea? I'll give you an idea. She didn't do it under oath. But I would do it under oath. Listen, but I would do it. And you know she didn't do it under oath, right?\nIf you didn't know about Hillary, then you're not much of a reporter.\nOh, I would do it under oath.\nAbsolutely.\nWell, what am I going to say? I am very disturbed, as is the general, as is everybody else that is intelligent. When you look at — five months? This is the late great Rose Mary Woods, right? [inaudible] This is a large-scale version of this. That was 18 minutes, this is five months. They say it's 50,000 texts and it's prime time. That's disturbing.\nWell, McCabe got more than $500,000 from essentially Hillary Clinton. And is he investigating Hillary Clinton?\nDo you remember, did anybody hear many of my speeches when I talked about McCabe? He was the star of my speech. This isn't now. And I said a man who was more or less in charge of her — the wife got $500,000 from Terry. Now Terry is Hillary. And, yeah, I mean —\nYou know what, I keep out of it. You'd find that hard to believe. I keep out of it. That's the way it fell. He's been there. It's one of those things. But he was the star of many of my speeches. Because he got from $500,000 to $700,000, whatever the number was. Got that money for the wife. And, you know, in Virginia—\nIt's very interesting.\nWait. In Virginia, you don't have to spend the money. So I never checked as to whether or not they spent the money on the campaign. How much of the money did he spend on the campaign, do you know — she — how much was it?\nWait, how much of the money was spent?\nYou know.\nI don't think so.\nNo, I don't think I did.\nI don't know what's the big deal with that. Because I would ask you, \"Who did you vote for?\"\nI don't think that's a big deal. But I don't remember that. I saw that this morning. I don't remember asking him that question.\nI don't remember asking him the question. I think it's also a very unimportant question, but I don't remember asking him that.\nHey, chief, would you do me a favor? When we come back, when we come back, I want you to have a deal, OK? See if you could have a deal.\nNice — and, not — you don't repeat, and this and that, just one nice piece. OK?\nI only repeat for the purposes of making sure you understand.\nWe're going to find out.\nBecause here's what we'll say, and everybody says: No collusion. There's no collusion. Now they're saying, \"Oh, well, 'Did he fight back? Did he fight back?' You fight back, 'Oh, it's obstruction.' So, here's the thing: I hope so.\nYou're going to define it for me, OK? But I can tell you, there's no collusion. I couldn't have cared less about Russians having to do with my campaign. The fact is — you people won't say this, but I'll say it: I was a much better candidate than her. You always say she was a bad candidate. You never say I was a good candidate. I was one of the greatest candidates. Nobody else would have beaten the Clinton machine, as crooked as it was. But I was a great candidate. Someday you're going to say that.

{"Title": "Interview with Joe Kernen of CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland", "Date": "2018-01-26", "Text": "Thank you very much, Joe.\nI've known you a long time.\nAnd we've done many of these, but a little bit different position. I was a developer.\nCouple of more people.\nSo when I decided to come to Davos I didn't think in terms of elitists or globalists. I think I thought in terms of lots of people that want to invest lots of money, and they're all coming back to the United States, they're coming back to America. And I thought of it much more in those terms. After I said that I was going there were massive stories about the elite, and the globalists, and the planes flying in, and everything else. It's not about that. It's about coming to America, investing your money, creating jobs, companies coming in. We're setting records every week, every day we're setting records. You see what's going on. Apple now with $350 billion. Most people thought they meant $350 million, which would build a nice plant. But I spoke with Tim Cook and I was very honored. But you remember my campaign, I used to say, \"I won't consider this great unless Apple starts coming in and really investing big money doing the plants.\" They're gonna do a lot.\n... but so many companies are coming in and so many jobs ...\nThere's a lot of room. And we love global, but we love home. We have to take care of our home.\nNow, we have the disadvantage of having spent, as of about a month ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East. $7 trillion. That's a big disadvantage. And we're still there, and I've beaten ISIS, I've done—we've done a good job. But it's such a shame. It's such a sad, sad thing.\nGo ahead.\nRight.\nSure.\nGood. Good.\nAnd that's why I'm here. To a large extent, that's why I'm here. I think that the tax plan has been even better than we thought, Joe. What did happen that nobody considered is that AT&T started, but they immediately followed ...\nHundreds of companies are giving thousands and thousands of dollars to their workers. And now you have almost 3 million workers that are receiving thousands of dollars. Nobody ever thought — that was not, like, in the plan ...\nYeah, even Starbucks, yesterday Disney and others. I mean ...\nBy the way, the ones that aren't doing it, those employees are going like, \"How about us?\" Guess what? They're gonna be doing it, too. Go ahead.\nNo. I don't think – they can't do that.\nHe can't do it ...\nIt's OK.\nThat was Lloyd?\nAnd Jamie's become very positive ...\nI think it'll be much higher than that. So I said and let's see what happens, because as you know, we're getting a report very soon, so we're going to see what that is. But I just happened to ask what we were doing. Because you know, if you look at the real numbers, had I not won, had the Democrat won — I'm going to be nice — the Democrat, I say, won— I would consider their last quarter my first quarter. Because you know, I just got there. So let's say the first quarter of '17 you had a 1.2 GDP. OK? 1.2. In the fourth quarter, which is the Obama quarter, you had a 1.8. Before that, you had a 2.8, a 2.2. You had — weren't doing very well. And it was the worst recovery — I guess do they say ever, or since the Great Depression? But it was the worst recovery.\nHad the Democrat won — the stock market is up almost 50 percent since my election — had the Democrat won, I believe you would have been down 50. That's the direction we were headed. And you know, a lot of that, regulation. It was staggering. You could not do anything. You couldn't build — I approved immediately — the two pipelines, 48,000 jobs ...\nYes.\nYeah. It's difficult.\nWell, a lot of people have given me an A. Somebody gave me an A-plus. So look, I got the biggest tax plan in our history approved. And don't forget, not just a tax plan.\nI got rid of the ...\nJoe, one second. I got rid of the individual mandate, the most — the biggest part and the most unpopular thing in Obamacare, which really repeals Obamacare, because it can't live without the mandate, because that's where a lot of the money came. It was very unfair to people. And we did ANWR [Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]. ANWR, Ronald Reagan tried to do it 40 years ago. I mean, everybody's been trying to do ANWR, and I got ANWR done as part of that same bill. So on top of the biggest tax cuts, great reform and the money is coming in. I mean, the money is pouring in. We probably take in $4 trillion from overseas that would never have been able to be here because of regulation.\nAnd taxes. Yeah.\nYeah.\nWhatever it is.\nIt's time ...\nI like bilateral because if you have a problem, you terminate. When you're in with many countries, like with TPP — so you have 12 if we were in — you don't have that same, you know, you don't have that same option. But somebody asked me other day would I do TPP. Here's my answer. I'll give you a big story. I would do TPP if we made a much better deal than we had. We had a horrible deal. The deal was a horrible deal. NAFTA's a horrible deal, we're renegotiating it. I may terminate NAFTA, I may not. We'll see what happens. But NAFTA was and I went around and I'd tell stadiums full of people, \"I'll terminate it or renegotiate it.\"\nI'm only saying this: I would do TPP if we were able to make a substantially better deal. The deal was terrible. The way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal I would be open to TPP.\nAre you surprised to hear me say that?\nDon't be surprised, no. But we have to make a better deal ...\nThe deal was a bad deal, like the Iran deal is a bad deal ...\nThese are bad deals.\nHey Joe, we have a trade deficit with Mexico. Mexico, $71 billion a year, right? We have a trade deficit with Canada of a substantial amount of money. I have a number but they keep arguing, they keep saying no — so I won't say it. I won't tell you it's $17 million, OK? We have a trade deficit with Canada. We have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. Got to do something. We can't continue to do this ...\nI've always said during the campaign and as you noticed and as you've actually said a couple of times, which I've always appreciated, I have fulfilled a lot of what I've said. And I'm only here a year. You know, I think I have four years and maybe another four years, OK, if we keep going ...\nWe'll see what happens. But Joe, we have a $71 billion a year trade deficit with Mexico. We got to do something. We can't have that. So will it be renegotiated? We're trying right now with [U.S. Trade Representative] Bob Lighthizer and the whole group. I think we have a good chance but we'll see what happens.\nYeah.\nHe made a mistake in shutting down. He shouldn't have shut down. People of this country want security, they want safety, they want their military to be taken care of.\nWell, we've already started the process ...\nI think Cotton, and Perdue and Goodlatte, and the people that I've been dealing with — Cornyn, so many of the people — these are great people. These are people that really have shifted a lot. They've really shifted a lot, and I think they're willing to shift more, and so am I.\nWe're going to see. If we make the right deal. I think they will. These are people that have very strong opinions on DACA and on immigration generally. And I happen to think they're largely right. Look, we're going to try and make a deal on DACA. We have a good chance of making it. What we need is we need the wall, we need security, we need security at the border. We have to stop the drugs from coming in. We need safety and we need a strong military.\nWe need almost more than ever before — I mean, we've been in wars so we needed it then — but we need to be sure that our military is properly funded, and it would be really great to get rid of the, you know, we'd like to have a regular budget.\nWe're asking ...\nWe agreed to $25 billion ...\nYeah, sure. He took it back but, you know, that's ...\nBut he didn't really take it back. If you see numerous senators on the other side they said, \"We'd give the wall in two minutes if we could do something with DACA.\" Everybody wants to solve the DACA problem. They've been wanting to solve it for a long time. It should've been solved by President Obama. It would've been easier to solve it, especially when he had the House and the Senate. They could've solved it in a day. But they didn't solve it, he didn't solve things. And he did something that he didn't have the right to do. You understand, he did an executive order and that was no good.\nAnd by the way, the court — it wasn't me. The courts were not upholding that executive order. You have to do it through Congress. I want to solve the DACA problem. I will consider that a great achievement to solve the DACA problem. It's been out there for a long time. These are good people, these are people that should be able to stay in this country. We're going to solve the DACA problem. But we also want to solve a tremendous problem on the southern border, which is crime. We need a wall, we need the drugs to stop flowing in. They are coming in like — well, they're coming in less now than they were because we have a very strong — we have great Border Patrol agents, great ICE — we have great people and they are really doing a good job. And you see what's happening at the border, it's much better.\nBut we need a strong border. And to do that you need a wall. And they did agree to a $25 billion wall, of which I'll have a lot of money left over. Because I don't need $25 billion to build a wall. We'll build a great — that's what I do. We'll build a great wall and we'll have a lot of money left over, and we'll spend it on other things. But we need great security. And yes, Senator Perdue, Senator Cotton, Cornyn, this one, that one, we have tremendous support to get something done. Tremendous, Joe. And I think something will get done.\nBig problem.\nDifferent country.\nWe need vocational schools. We need the community colleges in many cases ...\nOh, I think it's a big factor for us. But I also want these great companies that are coming in — Toyota's now coming in. We talked already about Apple. Apple's coming in with a very big presence. We had many companies — Chrysler's coming in, leaving Mexico and coming back to Michigan. I mean, how good is that? When was the last time you heard that? And without me being here and without what we've been doing including regulation, by the way, because I happen to think that regulation is as big as the tax cuts, OK? I think the tax cuts are incredible. But I think the regulations, the cutting of regulations — because the businesses couldn't even — they couldn't do anything. They were totally bound. You'd have to get 16 different approvals from 15 different agencies. Hey Joe, it was impossible to do business. And I think you know that maybe better than anybody. The cutting of the regulations was every bit as important as what we did with the tax cuts. But you put them both together and we have a dynamic country again. I mean, everybody's talking. I just came out and some really wonderful people said, \"Davos has never been like this.\" This is like walking into the Academy Awards, except we have more photographers.\nSo let me tell you, I think they were taken out of context because I read his exact statement. I'll tell you where I stand, which ultimately is very important. No. 1, I don't like talking about it because, frankly, nobody should be talking about it. It should be what it is. It should also be based on the strength of the country. We are doing so well, our country is becoming so economically strong again — and strong in other ways too, by the way — that the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger. And ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar. Right now it floats. But it's your great reserve currency. There can never be anything even close to it. There is nothing close to it, there never will be.\nBut ultimately the dollar, because our country is going to get so much stronger economically, if you look at what's happened to our country over the — look, I've been talking about this with you for 25 years. Trade. It started with Japan, morphed into China, now it's China, Japan, it's everybody. And everybody has taken advantage of our country. They have ripped our country off. You look at what they do. I saw something on motorcycles today with a certain country. Why should I say? But they sell motorcycles into our country, no tax. We sell motorcycles into their country — Harley-Davidsons, the greatest, right? We sell them into their country, 100 percent tax. Not going to happen.\nThe word \"reciprocal\" is the most important word with Donald Trump when it comes to what the subject that we talk about and the subject that CNBC covers so well — especially you, by the way, because I don't agree with all of you people, but that's OK. But reciprocal. I want reciprocal. If they're going to charge us 100 percent for a motorcycle, it should be 100 percent the other way, too. And you know, when you mention a tax at the border, a 10 percent tax on the border for everything coming in, I'm a free trader. Totally. I'm a fair trader. I'm all kinds of trader, but I want reciprocal. Because when China's charging us a fortune to send products in and making it impossible for the product to get there — and many other countries, by the way, not just China. China's the biggest. And then we charge them nothing to sell their stuff here. It's not fair. When you use the word \"reciprocal\" everybody understands that. If they do it to you, you do it to them and everybody understands it, Joe. And you're going to see a lot of that in my administration. And you're already seeing it.\nI don't think the Democrats would shut it down again.\nNo. Because you look at every poll, it said they made a mistake.\nI don't want to say Schumer got badly beaten. Why should I do that? I'm negotiating with someone — I'm not going to say he got badly beaten. But you look at what happened. The people want security and they want DACA taken care of. But more importantly, they want security, they want the borders strong, they want to have a strong border. They don't want to have MS-13 coming into our cities. You know how many of these people were getting out? These are horrible, horrible human beings. And they came here as horrible human beings. And Joe, it sounds terrible. They don't shoot somebody, they cut them up into little pieces because it's more painful. I don't want them — we are taking them out by the thousands. By the thousands.\nWe don't want them coming in, but we're going to take care of DACA. Nobody wants to take care of DACA more than myself and the Republican Party. And the Republican Party is unified at a level that Paul Ryan called me the other day. He said, \"I have to tell you, Mr. President, I've been here for a long time and I've been a part of the Republican Party, and I've been watching it for a long time. For many decades I've never seen the Republican Party unified like it is under your presidency.\" And that — that was Paul Ryan. And I thought that was a very nice statement, a very nice statement. And I think Mitch McConnell actually feels the same way. We want to do what's right and we're going to do what's right, and we're going to solve the DACA problem. And I don't think the Democrats would want to pull another shutdown. But we'll get it solved. And if we need a little more time, we'll take a little more time. I want to get the problem solved correctly.\nThank you very much, Joe. It's been an honor.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-joe-kernen-cnbc-the-world-economic-forum-davos-switzerland"}
{"Title": "Interview with Piers Morgan of The Spectator on Good Morning Britain", "Date": "2018-01-28", "Text": "I'm good thank you, Piers.\nIt has, since you became my Champion on the Apprentice.\nCan you believe it? It's a long time but I appreciate all the nice things you've said, and every once in a while a hit, but that's OK.\nThat's true.\nThat's true. No I don't, if it's real. If it's fake, I don't like it. I mean when they give you false stories, and there's so much of it in the media, but you've always been very fair. And you really are a talented guy. Look, you were on the Apprentice, and I wouldn't say you were the most popular person in the sense of the other people liking you, but you were the smartest person and that had something to do with your victory.\nGo ahead.\nThat's true.\nWell, it's been an interesting campaign, and you know, often times they say that Hillary was a terrible candidate. They never said I was a great candidate, but we won. It was a convincing win. It was an electoral college – I guess it was like 223 to 306. You remember that it could never be 270. I'd love to do popular vote, it would be such a thing. I would love to do a popular vote, but it's a much different kind of a contest. I think it would be actually an easier way of doing it, but the electoral college is nice because it gets you into so many different states that you wouldn't see otherwise. But we had a great campaign and we won, and the country is doing fantastically well.\nWell, that's such a false story. That's fake news, that was in that fake book. But that is such a false story. I mean first of all, you know me, and I actually though I was going to win because I'd go to stadiums and we'd have 25,000, 30,000 people in the stadiums. We would have a fever pitch, it was incredible what was happening that last two months of the campaign. And coming into the last month I thought we were going to win. We were getting massive crowds. My opponent was not getting good crowds at all. She was getting, you know, singers and entertainers to fill up the stadiums. They'd finish singing and then everybody would leave and she was left there. So I'm telling you, I really thought I was going to win, and I very much wanted to win. If I didn't win I would have been very disappointed.\nI plead not guilty.\nI think I shakes things up. It had to be shaken up. The country had to be shaken up. We're doing incredibly on an economic basis. Financial – stock market just hit another new high. We've had 84 – since the election – 84 new market highs. Think of that. It's incredible. It's never happened before. It's a record. That in itself is a record. During the course of a little more than a year we've had – think of it – 84 stock market records. It's going to go higher. Regulation – nobody's done anywhere near like I've done. That's also a record, a world record for presidents. But what happened is, we passed a tax bill – not easy to get. Many people have tried to do it, they weren't able to do it, and this is the biggest one we've ever passed, bigger than the Reagan bill. And it's had a bigger impact than anybody even thought. But I would also say that the tax cuts, added to the regulation cuts, is what made the difference. And people...\nWell, I thought it was great, but that was one move. They're going to invest $350 billion, they're going to build plants all over the place, they're going to build a college, they're going to build this incredible campus. They are fantastic. So it's a $350 billion investment, which I guess is probably the largest – or certainly right up there – largest ever made by a company. So we're doing very well, people are coming back into the country in droves. One thing very exciting to me is Chrysler – they're leaving Mexico and they're going back to Michigan. You haven't heard that in a long time. We're doing things that nobody thought possible and the country is becoming very very strong again economically. Unemployment is at record lows. Women unemployment – 17 years. Think of it, 17 years. Black unemployment – the best record in history, the history of our country. African American unemployment, best. Hispanic unemployment, best in the history of the country. All of the things that I said on the campaign trail coming true, so I'm very happy about it.\nAnd that's been taking... a lot of the global economy Piers is because of how well we're doing. Most people won't admit that, but we are doing well, that's helping all around the globe. That's a very good thing.\nI don't think it's so many of my supporters. I think a lot of other people, they use that... I don't call it tweeting, I call it social media. And you're a big social media man by the way. you do great with it. And I think you might agree with that statement.\nIf I wasn't able to do that – I call it a modern day form of communication, OK – if I wasn't able to do that, because I get a lot of fake news, I get a lot of news that's very false, very made up. You saw all of the stories that were wrong this year. I mean one of the stories was so wrong it drove the stock market down substantially and it was wrong. They've made a lot of mistakes and lot of them were made on purpose. If I don't have that form of communication, I can't defend myself. Unless I'm going to have a news conference every 15 minutes...\nI do. I do. I also give it to people and sometimes I'll have – I had one case where a lawyer did a tweet, you know they'd call it. I have a man, Dan Scavino, and I have people that are with me, you know Hope [Hicks] and you know Sarah [Huckabee Sanders]...\n...It's a crazy situation.\nWell, perhaps sometimes in bed, perhaps sometimes at breakfast or lunch or whatever. But generally speaking during the early morning or during the evening, I can do that, but I'm very busy during the day – very long hours, I'm busy – and sometimes I'll just dictate out something really quickly and they'll give it to one of my people to put it up.\nWell, I am for them and I think a lot of them understand that. You know, I won many categories of women and the women vote in the election, and people were shocked to see it. I was running against a woman and I'm winning all of these categories. You know that better than anybody. And I think I would do even better right now... In fact we've just had polls coming out just a little while ago, just before I walked into the room that are really up tremendously. I think that's maybe because of the economy, but I just said before that women have the best unemployment numbers that they've had in 17 years. And they're doing tremendously in business, they're doing tremendously in so many ways, and people are starting to see that. Now, you're always going to have marches, and I guess the march was a lot smaller than it was last year...\nI do, but I also think they want to feel safe at the border. I think they don't want people pouring into their country. I think they want to see our military get much stronger. I mean women, you know, families, they want to see strength at the border. They want to see a strong law enforcement. I'm a very much law and order person and candidate when I ran. The uniformed services, the military – there's nobody better than me on the military. I've increased the budget, we're going to have a budget, $700 billion this year. The Democrats were not going to have anywhere near that. I think women really like that. I think they want to be safe at home in many different respects...\nWell I think we have to evolve. If we don't evolve, there's something missing. But I have tremendous respect for women, and I think you know that very well because you know me, and you've spent a long period of time with me. You see all of the women I have working around me and working with me. Tremendous respect for women.\nNo, I wouldn't say I'm a feminist. I think that would be maybe going too far. I'm for women, I'm for men, I'm for everyone. I think people have to go out, they have to go out and really do it and they have to win... And women are doing great. And I'm happy about that.\nI think it's good. I think I'm very popular in your country.\nBut I believe that, I really do. I get so much fan mail from people in your country. They love my sense of security. They love what I'm saying about many different things. I have a great... I own the great Turnberry and other things in your country – Turnberry in Scotland – and I'm getting tremendous – I mean we get tremendous support from people in the UK.\nI don't know the man, I don't know the man.\nWell, that's their problem. I mean, if they don't, I could very nicely stay home. But I can tell you I have a very good relationship with your Prime Minister, who I just left. And I think she's been doing a very good job. We actually have a very good relationship, although a lot of people think we don't. I support her. I support a lot of what she does and a lot of what she says and I support you militarily very much. I mean, we will come to your defence if anything should happen, which hopefully will never happen. But I am a tremendous supporter of the UK. Tremendous supporter. There's nobody that believes more strongly.\nWell, my mother was born in Scotland, in the Hebrides.\nMy mother was born in Stornoway. You know what they call that? Serious Scotland, right? That's serious Scotland. She was born in Stornoway.\nI sort of do. I love the country. I'm in Aberdeen with a tremendous... I also have a great situation over in Ireland in Doonbeg over there. And of course Turnberry... that's the Mona Lisa, one of the great Mona Lisas of the world in terms of sport and golf, and I own Turnberry. And I love the UK. I have a special – maybe because it's my mother, who I thought was one of the great people I've ever known...\nShe would have... you know she had a great sense of regal. She had a great sense of... She had a love for the Queen. She had a love for the Royal Family. She really respected the Queen. And she loved the pomp and ceremony – and circumstance – but she loved the ceremony. The fact is, she loved the UK...\nWell, she would go back every year to Scotland. She just thought it was incredible. You know, she came over here when she was 19, she came over to the United States when she was 19. She met my father very... it was not a long time. They got married, they were married many many decades and they had a great marriage. You know, she was a terrific woman, and maybe that's... and again she loved Scotland and maybe that's one of the reasons that I feel the same way...\nWell, I do, but they're seen me have great success, because I've had great success. And you know, I've been successful even if you talk about, I do a show on television. They always turn out... very rarely does a show become a big hit like I had. I go into that, the real estate... I've had a lot of hits. So they got to see a lot, but there's nothing like what happened here. I mean, the presidency is something special, but more importantly, I'm so happy with the results, because if you look at what's going on, and you look at our country, and you look at the way it's thriving. We're having a stock market like just about they've never had before. Ever before. We've picked up... Piers, we've picked up $8 trillion in value during the course of 12 months...\nWell, three times – boom boom boom.\nOf course, I didn't know that.\nWell, I know nothing about them, and I know nothing about them today other than I read a little bit, and I guess – and again, I'm in the United States, so I don't read as much about it. Perhaps it was a bit story in Britain, perhaps it was a big story in the UK, but in the United States it wasn't a big story. I did a retweet. You know, a retweet sometimes you do... When you do your own tweeting or you do your own social media, it's fine. When you do those retweets, they can cause problems, because you never know who's doing it to start off with.\nWell, I don't know who they are. I know nothing about them, so I wouldn't be doing that. And I am as I say often, I am the least racist person that anybody's going to meet. And certainly I wasn't endorsing anybody. I knew nothing about them. They had a, I guess, a couple of depictions of radical Islamic terror. Radical Islamic terror, whether you like talking about it or not Piers, is...\n...Because you look at what's going on, you look at what's going on in the UK, you look at what's going on all over the world...\nSo you can try and shield it and say...\nGo ahead.\nWell, you know, look. It was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror. This was a depiction of radical Islamic terror.\nBut this was... I didn't do it, I didn't go out and... I did a retweet. It was a big story where you are, but it was not a big story where I am.\nSo you're telling me something...\nWell, I tell you, the real me is someone who loves Britain, who loves the UK, who loves... I love Scotland. I wish... You know, one of the biggest problems I have in winning – I won't be able to get back there so often. I would love to go there, as you know before this happened, I would be there a lot. Very special people and a very special place. So I don't want to cause any difficulty for your country, that I can tell you.\nIf you're telling me they're...\nHere's what's fair. If you're telling me these are horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that. I know nothing about them.\nI don't want to be involved with people, but you're telling me about these people, because I know nothing about these people.\nThank you.\nSo we are going to make a deal with the UK, that will be great. As you know, somewhat restricted. Because of Brexit you have a two year restriction. And when that restriction is up we're going to be your great trading partner. It's a tough restriction to have. You know for a couple of years, you have very strong lack of being able to do things.\nBecause I know the British people and I understand the British people, and the British people wanted to have control over their country. And they don't want to have people coming from all over the world into Britain and they don't know anything about these people. And I said because of immigration, and to a certain extent because of trade, but mostly immigration, I said that Brexit is going to be a big upset and I was right.\nWell, would it be the way I negotiate? No, I wouldn't negotiate the way it was negotiated. But I have a lot of respect for your Prime Minister, and I think they're doing a job. I think I would have negotiated it differently. I would have had a different attitude.\nI think I would have said that the European Union is not cracked up to what it's supposed to be, and I would have taken a tougher stand in getting out... I have a lot of problems with the European Union.\nThey're very... no, it's not a question of doing business. But I will tell you, representing the United States, it's a very unfair situation. We cannot get our product in. It's very very tough. And yet they send their product to us – no taxes, very little taxes, it's very unfair. I've had a lot of problems with the European Union, and it may morph into something very big from that standpoint, from a trade standpoint. The European Union has treated the United States very unfairly when it came to trade. They're not the only ones by the way. I could name many countries and places that do. But the European Union has been very very unfair to the United States, and I think it'll turn out to be very much to their detriment.\nNo, I like him. He's a friend of mine. Em-man-u-el! He's a great guy, his wife is fantastic. I like him a lot. You know, we had dinner at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\nWell I hadn't heard about banning, but I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, they respect what I stand for. And I do stand for tough borders.\nI don't care, I don't care. It's just one of those things. I don't say anything. You know why? Because I don't care.\nBy the way, we would have never been there with the previous administration.\nAnd I have to say this. With the economy, had the previous administration in its own form, in a different form, or let's put it, had the Democrats won – instead of being almost 50% up, they would have been 50% down, because the United States was heading in a very bad direction. Yeah, we've done very well in Iraq, we've done very well in Syria, we've hammered them. But they spread. They go all over. It's not a good situation, and nobody knows it better than the folks in the UK. You've had some tough bouts.\nNo, totally false. No, that's false.\nI feel love for all people, but if a person's bad, we've got to do something about it. There's got to be retribution. But I've had great great relationships with Muslims, and I had good support from Muslims during my presidential run. And I think I have good support right now. You know, it's interesting. They want to be safe also, Piers. And they like me because I give them security. I have a great relationship and respect for Muslims.\nI'm a very big Second Amendment person, as you know very well. But take a look at Paris, where you have very very tough gun controls, take a look at that horrible slaughter that took place at the cafes where so many people were killed. And you had these thugs come in with guns. One by one for a long time, they just killed and hundreds of people wounded to this day still in the hospitals. That was one of the worst. And you've had many of them, where there are no guns except for the bad guys. So the bad guys have the guns, and if you would have had somebody with a gun right here when they walked in so that you could have had bullets going in the other direction, you wouldn't have had hundreds of people killed... By the way, you have many of those. You look at San Bernardino, California. These guys walk in – the people that they knew – they walk in and they start one by one shooting them. They had no chance.\nPiers, they had no chance.\nYou have a lot of terrorism.\nI remember it very well. It was terrible.\nWe do have gun control laws, and this sick person – he was a sicko. I mean that's the big problem, there's sick people. If he didn't have a gun he would have had a bomb or he would have something else.\nThe point is he would have had 55 bombs. He would have had 55 of something else.\nYou know, it's an argument that people have... I've heard it every different way and we can go around this argument. I'm a Second Amendment person. I think you need it for security. I think it would be far worse. I think you need it for security. But again, you've had so many attacks where there was only a gun – a bad person's gun – going in this direction, and if you had one on the other side – so many. In fact, that's a very big example. And if they had the bullets going in the opposite direction, you would have saved a lot of lives. So I get what you're saying, but I believe in the Second Amendment.\nI think it's about everything and I'm a believer in clean air and clear water. The Paris Accord for us would have been a disaster...\nI'm completely out of it.\nThere could be a way back. First of all, it was a terrible deal for the United States. If they made a good deal, like if they made a good deal with TPP – you know, having to do with trade – there's always a chance we'd get back, but it was a terrible deal for the United States. It was unfair to the United States.\nThere is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look – it used to not be climate change. It used to be global warming. Right?\nThat wasn't working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they're setting records, so OK, they're at a record level. There were so many thing happening, Piers. I'll tell you what I believe in. I believe in clear air. I believe in crystal clear beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all. Now, that being said, if somebody said go back into the Paris Accord, if we could go back into the Paris Accord, it would have to be a completely different deal because we had a horrible deal, As usual, they took advantage of the United States. We were in a terrible deal. Would I go back in? Yeah, I'd go back in. I like, as you know, I like Emmanuel... No, no, I like Emmanuel, I would love to, but it's got to be a good deal for the United States.\nI changed it. I didn't want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks bought back into this. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all of the things that they're saying, where money goes toward – well money in that case was going to a government which was probably taking the money, OK? I do not, I turned that order around. That was an order.\nI turned that order around.\nWere you shocked? Were you shocked?\nThat was done by a very high level government person. As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around. That same day even. Not even a day went by. No, I was not believing in conservation that...\nWhich most people are not going to do too well on.\nI am a stable genius.\nDon't want to change that! No, they build that up. I eat fine food, I eat really... some of the finest chefs in the world. I eat healthy food. I also have some of that food on occasion. Sometimes it makes sense. Actually when you're campaigning there's a lot of sense to it because it's boom boom boom. But no, I think I eat actually quite well.\nHave I?\nNot that I know of.\nI want them to be happy. I really want them to be happy. They look like a lovely couple.\nWell, I still hope they're happy.\nThat's true!\nHe'll be so happy.\nWell I think that's beautiful. You know I have a son who does love this sport. He loves this sport.\nAnd it's growing very rapidly in the United States.\nNot particularly, no...\nBut I have a friend who owns Manchester United so I know exactly what I'm going to do with it.\nThat's great! That's beautiful. We'll do very well!\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-piers-morgan-the-spectator-good-morning-britain"}
{"Title": "Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union", "Date": "2018-01-30", "Text": "The President.Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic Chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission: to make America great again for all Americans.\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America's soul and the steel in America's spine.\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much.\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He's here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands—everywhere—we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job.\nSome trials over the past year touched this Chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work 3½ months later: the legend from Louisiana—[laughter]—Congressman Steve Scalise. [Applause] I think they like you, Steve. [Laughter] We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath—[applause]—yes. Yes.\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. [Applause] Thank you. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless or daring or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there's a challenge, we tame it. If there's an opportunity, we seize it. So let's begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. And something I'm very proud of: African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.\nSmall-business confidence is at an alltime high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion and more in value in just this short period of time. The great news for Americans: 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hard-working Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax free. We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. In April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month—a lot more.\nWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn't afford Government-ordered health plans. We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone, thank heavens. [Applause] Great job.\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000, a lot of money. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They've just finished the best year in their 20-year history. Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. It's a good feeling.\nOne of Staub's employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hard-working Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax cut raise into his new home and his two daughters' education. Corey, please stand. And he's a great welder. [Laughter] I was told that by the man that owns that company that's doing so well. So congratulations, Corey.\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses, many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it's getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States—just a little while ago.\nThis, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you've been or where you've come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.\nTonight I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, \"In God We Trust.\" And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support.\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. Preston, a job well done. Young patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special, that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you've done, Preston. Thank you very much.\nPreston's reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem. Americans love their country, and they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are totally defending our Second Amendment and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty.\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their health care decisions. Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. And I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.\nAll Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that's what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. So tonight I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people.\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. We have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful, clean coal. We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America's great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that's what's happening. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States, something we haven't seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama, a big one. And we haven't seen this in a long time. It's all coming back.\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They're coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That's where they want to be.\nExciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year, the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country's history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions and terminal illness should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It's time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. [Applause] Right?\nOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it's very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our Nation has lost its wealth, but we're getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal.\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they'll be good ones, but they'll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules.\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year. Isn't it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve.\nTonight I'm calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it.\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than 2 years and perhaps even 1. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart and American hands and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day's work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let's invest in workforce development, and let's invest in job training, which we need so badly. Let's open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. And let's support working families by supporting paid family leave.\nAs America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year, we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates, who have served their time, get a second chance at life.\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They've allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives.\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters—Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens—were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa's 16th birthday—such a happy time it should have been—neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.\nSix members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa's murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa's high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you.\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain. Tonight I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents—these are great people; these are great, great people—that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again.\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America's children, America's struggling workers, and America's forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\nSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this Chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \"D.J.\" and \"C.J.\" He said, \"Call me either one.\" [Laughter] So we'll call you \"C.J.\" [Laughter] Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job.\nAt one point, MS-13 leaders ordered C.J.'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members. And I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done, we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. So I just want to congratulate you, C.J. You're a brave guy. Thank you very much.\nAnd I asked C.J., \"What's the secret?\" He said, \"We're just tougher than they are.\" And I like that answer. [Laughter] Now, let's get Congress to send you—and all of the people in this great Chamber have to do it; we have no choice. C.J., we're going to send you reinforcements, and we're going to send them to you quickly. It's what you need.\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements and show good moral character will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period.\nThe second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like C.J., to keep our communities safe. Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch-and-release.\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. It's time to begin moving toward a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country.\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. It's time to reform these outdated immigration rules and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. So let's come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done.\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses: 174 deaths per day, 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge.\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long, and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do, in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail.\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He's here tonight with his wife Rebecca. Thank you, Ryan.\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn't know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \"You will do it, because you can.\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our Nation. Thank you. Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.\nAs we rebuild America's strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.\nFor this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully, never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. Perhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly.\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations as well. But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city, hopefully, soon and, hopefully, safely.\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2½ hours and through emergency surgery.\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin's selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight Kenton is recovering in Texas, Raqqa is liberated, and Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \"V\" for valor. Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you.\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are.\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield, including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released. So today I'm keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis—who is doing a great job, thank you—to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. I am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay.\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America's sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid. That is why tonight I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\nOtto Warmbier was a hard-working student at the University of Virginia, and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\nOtto's wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto's brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Tonight we pledge to honor Otto's memory with total American resolve. Thank you.\nFinally—[applause]—thank you. We are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Sung-ho. In 1996, Sung-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth.\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he'd met any Christians. He had, and he resolved, after that, to be free. Sung-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.\nToday, he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth. Today, he has a new leg. But, Sung-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you've come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. Sung-ho's story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.\nThat is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her: monuments to Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia. And Freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol—this living monument—this is the monument to the American people.\nAudience members.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President.We're a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters and police officers and border agents, medics and marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this Nation, belongs entirely to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\nAmericans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country, the people built this country, and it's the people who are making America great again.\nAs long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-25"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Malcolm B. Turnbull of Australia", "Date": "2018-02-23", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I'm honored to welcome my friend, Prime Minister Turnbull of Australia, and Mrs. Turnbull. Thank you very much. It's a great honor.\nWe're looking forward to sending our newly nominated Ambassador, Admiral Harry Harris, to you very shortly. He's an outstanding man. You're going to find that he's a great man.\nI want to thank the Prime Minister for offering his condolences on the horrible tragedy in Parkland, Florida. Americans are grateful for the prayers and support of our Australian friends—and friends they are—as our entire Nation grieves the senseless loss of 17 precious lives and all of the horribly injured.\nThe United States and Australia are currently honoring 100 years of mateship, a term that you use very beautifully, Mr. Prime Minister. A century has passed since brave Americans and Australians first fought together in World War I. Over the last 100 years, our partnership has thrived as a bulwark of freedom, security, and democracy.\nLast spring, the Prime Minister and I celebrated the remarkable 100-year milestone during an extraordinary evening on the USSIntrepid. And my friend Greg Norman and Anthony Pratt and some of the others who are in the room today, they were—hello, folks. Stand up, Greg. Stand up, Anthony. [Laughter] Where's Anthony? Good. That was a great—that was a great evening, thank you.\nThis afternoon I'm pleased to announce that the United States will name the Littoral Combat Ship 30, the USSCanberra, in honor of an Australian cruiser lost fighting alongside the U.S. Navy during World War II. Our Secretary of the Navy has chosen Australian Minister of Defense Marise Payne to be her sponsor.\nI know that the USSCanberrawill be a worthy successor to both her Australian namesake and her American predecessor, the former Navy Baltimore-class heavy cruiser, USSCanberra. As she sails the open sea, the new USSCanberrawill symbolize to all who cross her path the enduring friendship between the United States and Australia. There is no closer friendship.\nToday, strengthened by our common values and history, we're working together to promote our mutual interests. I want to thank the Prime Minister for serving as a strong voice for peace and stability across the entire Indo-Pacific region.\nAustralia is one of our closest partners in our campaign of maximum pressure to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. Today we put the strongest sanctions on Korea that we have ever put on a country. We must continue to stand together to prevent the brutal dictatorship from threatening the world with nuclear devastation.\nOur nations, likewise, share a commitment to keeping our people safe from terrorism. Australian troops are currently serving alongside Americans and our partners in Afghanistan and the coalition to defeat ISIS. Together, we're denying terrorists safe haven, cutting off their funding, and discrediting their wicked ideology. ISIS land has been largely recaptured, almost 100 percent, I'm very honored to say. And they are on the run. Our strong partnership can also be seen in our flourishing economic relationship. Australia remains a key market for U.S. defense products. We make the greatest products in the world, so you have very good taste in choosing our product—[laughter]—automobiles and aircraft. And our fair and reciprocal trading relationship is a model for other countries as we seek bilateral agreements.\nNews that America is open for business has also reached Australian shores. In May, Australian entrepreneur Anthony Pratt announced a new $2 billion investment in box-making factories across the United States. But he only did that if Trump won the election, I think. Is that a correct statement, Anthony?\nPratt/Visy Industries Global Chairman Anthony J. Pratt. A hundred percent correct.\nThank you. [Laughter] Boy, that was a close one. I was worried. [Laughter] These people would have had a field day if you gave the wrong answer. Thank you. [Laughter] No, but Anthony did call, and he said if he wins the election, we're going to spend billions of dollars in the United States. And I appreciate your giving me a very, very correct comment. Thank you, Anthony. I'll never do that again. [Laughter]\nThis investment will continue to build on an almost 100,000 American jobs that are taking place and already supported by Australian companies.\nI'm glad to share that the United States is also, by far, the largest investor in Australia. In the room today are dozens of American and Australian business leaders and great athletes—great athlete and business leader, by the way, Greg—who are working together to identify further opportunities for bilateral investment and cooperation.\nFantastic. Thank you very much.\nWell, thank you very much, Malcolm. That's very beautiful words, and we appreciate it. On behalf of the First Lady, who is right here, and our great Vice President, Mike, thank you very much. It's an honor to have you.\nAnd we'll ask—we'll answer a couple of questions. Is that okay?\nHow about Trey [Trey Yingst, One America News Network] from One America News? Trey? Where are you? Hi. Good, Trey, go ahead.\nYes.\nHow about one? [Laughter] Go ahead, Trey.\nWell, we're going to do a lot, but we are going to be very strong on background checks. I've spoken with many of our people in Congress—our Senators, our Congressmen and women—and there's a movement on to get something done. We want to be very powerful on background checks.\nWhen we're dealing with the mentally ill, as we were in this last case—he was a very sick person and somebody that should have been nabbed. I guess they had 39 different occasions where they were able to see him or potentially see him. We want to be very powerful, very strong on background checks and especially as it pertains to the mentally ill. We're going to get rid of the bump stocks, and we're going to do certain other things.\nBut one of the feelings that I have, and you probably heard me in a speech this morning—very, very important that we have offensive capability as well as defensive capability that's within the schools. Because when you have a gun-free zone, you're really inviting people to come in and do whatever you have to do and, oftentimes, get out.\nNow, I was the one that brought up the fact that these shootings, on average, last 3 minutes, and it takes anywhere from 6 to 10 minutes for the police to get to the site. And I want to have people in the building. And, in many cases, you have ex-marines and ex-Army and Navy and Air Force and Coast Guard—you have them in the building, and they can have concealed weapons and still be teachers, or they could be in the building in a different capacity.\nBut we have to have offensive capability to take these people out rapidly before they can do this kind of damage. But we'll be putting in strong language having to do with the background checks, and that will take place very quickly.\nI spoke with Paul Ryan this morning, with Mitch McConnell, and people are looking to really energize. I know that you've had—this has been going on for a long time. Many, many years. And you've had people in my position, and they would mention things, but not a lot of things got done, obviously. We take it very seriously. We want to put an end to it.\nAnd if, by the way, the bad guy thinks that somebody is in this room with a weapon that's going to be pointed at him with live bullets, he's not even going into the school. It's the one way you're going to solve it. You're not going to solve it with gun-free spaces, because they'll get in there, and they're going to be the only one with a gun. So we need offensive capability, and we're going to be doing something about it. We're dealing with Congress right now.\nThank you. Thank you.\nWell, I think it's going to make it safer, and, you know, the problem that's been happening over the last 20 years is people have talked—you said it—it's all talk, it's no action. And we're going to take action. I think it's going to make it safer. I think the fact that you have some capability within a school, they're not going to go into that school. They're not going to do it.\nYou can look at what's happened with airplanes where we put marshals on planes with guns; where pilots, in many cases, have guns. Nothing has happened for a long period of time, when it used to almost—it was getting to a point of being routine. When you have somebody with a gun staring you down, it's going to be a lot different for them to walk into those schools.\nRight now they look at the sign outside, \"This is a gun-free environment.\" That means they're the only one with a gun. And the damage this lunatic did in that school for such a long period of time.\nAnd, frankly, you had a gun, and he was outside as a guard, and he decided not to go in. That was not his finest moment, that I can tell you. He waited, and he didn't want to go into the school. I just heard this, and it's a terrible situation.\nBut we need people that can take care of our children. We're not going to let this happen again. And the way it's not going to happen again—because they're basically cowards. Innately, they're cowards. And if they know bad things happen to them, once they get into that school, by people that love the children—see, a security guard doesn't know the children, doesn't love the children. This man standing outside of the school the other day doesn't love the children, probably doesn't know the children. The teachers love their children; they love their pupils; they love their students. They're doing it also from love. Now, they have to be very adept. I'm not talking about every teacher; I'm talking about a small percentage. But people that have great ability with weaponry, with guns, those are the only people I'm talking about it. But they'll protect the student.\nFor the Prime Minister?\nI will say, what Russia and what Iran and what Syria have done recently is a humanitarian disgrace. I will tell you that. We're there for one reason: We're there to get ISIS and get rid of ISIS and go home. We're not there for any other reason, and we've largely accomplished our goal.\nBut what those three countries have done to people over the last short period of time is a disgrace.\nWell, I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership was not a good deal for us. And if they made it a good deal for us, I'd go in. But honestly, it wasn't. I like bilateral deals much more than multilateral. I like to be able to negotiate with one country. And if it doesn't work out, you terminate. And during the termination notice, right after you consent, they call you and they say, \"Please, let's make a deal,\" and you fix the deal. When you get into multi, you can't do that.\nBut Trans-Pacific Partnership—TPP—was a very bad deal for the United States. It would have cost us tremendous amounts of jobs. It would have been bad. But there's a possibility we would go in, but they will be offering us a much better deal. I would certainly do that.\nAs far as your lanes are concerned, we'd love to have Australia involved, and I think Australia wants us to stay involved. I have to say, we've developed a great relationship with China, other than the fact that they've been killing us on trade for the last long period of time—killing us, absolutely killing the United States on trade.\nBut we have developed a great relationship with China—probably closer than we've ever had. And my personal relationship, as Malcolm can tell you, with President Xi is, I think, quite extraordinary. He's somebody that I like, and I think he likes me. With that being said, he likes China and I like the United States. [Laughter]\nBut a lot of things are happening. It's going to be a very interesting period of time. But we do have to straighten out. And as much I like and respect—really respect President Xi, we have to straighten out the trade imbalance. It's too much. It's no good.\nWell, to the second, we'll have to see. I don't think I'm going to exactly play that card. But we'll have to see. If the sanctions don't work, we'll have to go phase two. And phase two may be a very rough thing. May be very, very unfortunate for the world. But hopefully the sanctions will work. We have tremendous support all around the world for what we're doing. It really is a rogue nation. If we can make a deal, it'll be a great thing. And if we can't, something will have to happen. So we'll see.\nAs far as General Mattis is concerned, I mean, he has that view, and a lot of people have that view. China is tough. They're getting stronger. They're getting stronger to a large extent, with a lot of the money they've made from having poor leadership in the United States, because the United States leadership has allowed them to get away with murder.\nWith that being said, I think we can have a truly great even trading relationship with China. Hopefully that's going to work out. And hopefully the relationship I have with President Xi will make that happen. Only time will tell. Thank you.\nI don't think we've ever had a better relationship with China than we do right now. The only thing that can get in its way is trade, because it's so one-sided, it's so lopsided. And the people that stood here for many years in this position, right where I am right now, should never have allowed that to happen. It's very unfair to the United States, and it's very unfair to the workers of the United States. Very, very unfair.\nAnd even today, it's extremely hard on companies that want to do business in China, because the barriers are incredible, whereas the barriers coming into our country are foolishly not. Foolishly. I believe in reciprocal trade. If they do something to us, we do something to them. Well, that never happened. And it's gotten worse and worse over the years. But we'll correct it. That can be the only thing that can get in the way of a truly long-term, great relationship. Because we have all the ingredients for friendship.\nFrom the Washington Examiner, Gabby [Gabby Morrongiello, Washington Examiner].\nYes.\nWell, Jared has done an outstanding job. I think he's been treated very unfairly. He's a high-quality person. He works for nothing, just so—nobody ever reports that. But he gets zero. He doesn't get a salary, nor does Ivanka, who's now in South Korea—long trip—representing her country. And we cannot get a better representative. In fact, the First Lady, Melania, was telling me what a great impression she made this morning when she landed in South Korea.\nJared is truly outstanding. He was very successful when he was in the private sector. He's working on peace in the Middle East and some other small and very easy deals. They've always said peace in the Middle East, peace between the Palestinians and Israel, is the toughest deal of any deal there is.\nMalcolm, I've heard this all my life, that as a former dealmaker—although now you could say maybe I'm more of a dealmaker than ever before; you have no choice as President to do it right—but the hardest deal to make of any kind is between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We're actually making great headway. Jerusalem was the right thing to do. We took that off the table.\nBut Jared Kushner is right in the middle of that, and he's an extraordinary dealmaker. And if he does that, that will be an incredible accomplishment and a very important thing for our country.\nSo General Kelly—who's doing a terrific job, by the way—is right in the middle of that. We inherited a system that's broken. It's a system where many people have just—it's taken months and months and months to get many people that do not have a complex financial—you know, complicated financials. They don't have that, and it's still taken months. It's a broken system, and it shouldn't take this long. You know how many people are on that list, people with not a problem in the world.\nSo that will be up to General Kelly. General Kelly respects Jared a lot, and General Kelly will make that call. I won't make that call. I will let the General, who's right here, make that call.\nBut Jared is doing some very important things for our country. He gets paid zero. Ivanka, by the way, gets paid zero. She gave up a very good and very strong, solid big business in order to come to Washington, because she wanted to help families and she wanted to help women. She said, \"Dad, I want to go to Washington, I want to help women.\" And I said, \"You know, Washington is a mean place.\" She said: \"I don't care. I want to help women. I want to help families.\" And she was very much involved, as you know, in the child tax credit. And now she's working very much on family leave—things that I don't think would have been in the agreement if it weren't for Ivanka and some of our great Senators, et cetera. But she was very much in the forefront of that.\nSo I will let General Kelly make that decision. And he's going to do what's right for the country. And I have no doubt he'll make the right decision. Okay? Thank you very much.\nDo you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nAnd I have to add to that. They are very different countries with very different sets of problems. But I think we're well on the way to solving that horrible problem that happens far too often in the United States.\nThank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-malcolm-b-turnbull-australia"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Stefan Lofven of Sweden", "Date": "2018-03-06", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm honored to be joined by Prime Minister Lofven of Sweden at our first meeting in the White House.\nSweden is one of our oldest and closest partners, and was among the first European nations to offer the United States an unsolicited treaty of friendship -- a treaty signed, believe it or not, in 1783. That's a long time ago.\nMy daughter, Ivanka, had a wonderful time watching American and Swedish athletes compete in the recent Men's Curling Final at the Olympics. (Laughter.)\nThat was something, huh? That was a little upset. But that wasn't expected, but that's okay. We'll take it. Right? All of the athletes should be immensely proud of the great job they did.\nThe Prime Minister and I have just concluded a series of very productive meetings. The relationship between the United States and Sweden is one based on shared values, including respect for individual rights, the rule of law, and human dignity. These common principles are the foundation of our partnership. And we have had a great partnership for many years.\nWe look forward to exploring further opportunities to increase our security and our cooperation in every other way. And we encourage nations around the world to share responsibility for our common defense.\nWe appreciate Sweden's leadership on the United Nations Security Council, and look very much forward to working together in the coming months.\nThe United States is also grateful to Sweden for advocating for Americans detained in North Korea. I particularly want to thank the Swedish government for its assistance in securing the release of American college student Otto Warmbier last year. Terrible, tragic event. We continue to pray for Otto's parents, Fred and Cindy -- two terrific people -- over the tragic death of their son.\nAnd we remain determined to achieve a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. And there's been a lot of news on that today. Hopefully, it's positive. Hopefully, it will lead to a very positive result.\nIn economic matters, we are striving for a relationship grounded in fairness and reciprocity. The United States is one of the largest investors in Sweden, and the Swedish investments in the United States support over 200,000 American jobs.\nEarlier this afternoon, I heard from several Swedish business executives -- some of the greatest in the world. Where are you, folks? Please. Some of the great executives in the world. People I've known for a long time and certainly know of. And they're investing tremendous amounts of money in the United States and supporting, also, vocational training for American workers. We are grateful for those investments, and we are committed to working with Sweden to pursue even greater economic cooperation.\nWe're also continuing to pursue bilateral agreements to advance mutual prosperity. I'm pleased that Sweden intends to procure the Patriot air and missile defense system -- finest in the world -- in a deal worth over $3 billion. This system will increase stability and security in the Baltic Sea region.\nA strong and balanced economic relationship strengthens security and prosperity in both of our countries. And this is just the beginning. We have a lot of things that we're working on. And we're working on them, really, very hard.\nThank you very much.\nWell, the United States has been taken advantage of by other countries, both friendly and not so friendly, for many, many decades. And we have a trade deficit of $800 billion a year, and that's not going to happen with me. We have been mistreated by many, sometimes fairly, but there are, really, very few instances where that's taken place.\nAnd I don't blame the countries. I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. When I was with President Xi in China -- as an example, we lose $500 billion a year on trade. We have a deficit of approximately $500 billion a year with China. And we're doing things with China which are very strong, but they understand it. But I was with him and I said to him in public, I said, \"Look, I'm not blaming you. I blame our people for not doing a better job, for allowing this to happen.\"\nBut it's like that with many countries, other than small -- the European Union has been particularly tough on the United States. They make it almost impossible for us to do business with them, and yet they send their cars and everything else back into the United States. And they can do whatever they'd like, but if they do that, then we put a big tax of 25 percent on their cars. And believe me, they won't be doing it very long. The European Union has not treated us well, and it's been a very, very unfair trade situation.\nI'm here to protect. And one of the reasons I was elected is I'm protecting our workers, I'm protecting our companies. And I'm not going to let that happen.\nSo we're doing tariffs on steel. We cannot lose our steel industry. It's a fraction of what it once was. And we can't lose our aluminum industry. Also a fraction of what it once was.\nAnd our country is doing well. The massive tax cuts and all of the deregulation has really kicked us into gear. But I have to work on trade deals. We're working on NAFTA right now. And if we're able to make a deal with Canada and Mexico in NAFTA, then there will be no reason to do the tariffs with Canada and Mexico.\nBut again, other countries we won't have that choice, unless they can do something for us. As an example, if the European Union takes off some of the horrible barriers that make it impossible for our product to go into there, then we can start talking. Otherwise, we're going to leave it the way it is.\nSo the fact is we've been mistreated as a country for many years, and it's just not going to happen any longer.\nWell, we'll have to see. You know, when we're behind on every single country, trade wars aren't so bad. You understand what I mean by that? When we're down by $30 billion, $40 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion, the trade war hurts them; it doesn't hurt us. So we'll see what happens.\nYou know, you can also take it -- in some cases, we lose on trade, plus we give them military where we're subsidizing them tremendously. So not only do we lose on trade, we lose on military, and hence we have these massive deficit numbers in our country. We're going to straighten it out. And we'll do it in a very loving way. It will be a loving, loving way. They'll like us better and they will respect us much more. Because even they say -- right now, they say, \"We can't believe we've gotten away.\" I mean, two countries have said, \"We cannot believe, to be honest with you, we've gotten away with this so long.\" Now, one of them made that statement before I got elected. He said, \"I can't believe I made that statement before I got elected.\" But it's one of those things.\nWe have to straighten it out. We really have no choice.\nJust to add maybe a little bit further: If you talk China, I've watched where the reporters have been writing, 2 percent of our steel comes from China. Well, that's not right. They transship all through other countries. And you'll see that a country that doesn't even have a steel mill is sending us 3 percent steel for our country. And many countries are doing it, but it comes from China.\nSo China doesn't send us 2 percent; they send us a much, much higher level than that. But it's called transshipping. So it doesn't look good when it all comes out of China, so they send it through other countries, and it comes to us. And it's putting our steel mills out of business. Our aluminum mills are going out of business. And we need steel and we need aluminum.\nAnd you know there's a theory that if a country doesn't have steel, it doesn't have a country. And it's true. So this is more than just pure economics. This is about defense. This is about the country itself.\nBut again, remember this: We lose $800 billion a year in trade. And I think I was elected, at least partially, on this issue. And I've been saying it for 25 years -- our country has been taken advantage of by everybody. By everybody. Almost everybody. And we cannot let that happen any longer, not for our companies and not, most importantly, for our workers. So we're not going to let it happen.\nI think you have a wonderful Prime Minister, I have to say. We've gotten to know each other. Certainly, you have a problem with the immigration. It's caused problems in Sweden. I was one of the first ones to say it. I took a little heat, but that was okay because I proved to be right. But you do have a problem, and I know the problem will slowly disappear -- hopefully, rapidly disappear.\nBut as far as our relationship with Sweden, it's going to be only stronger, only better, both in a military sense and a trading sense, and economic sense. You know, Sweden is, I think, the largest -- the eighth largest investor in the United States. And they like me very much because the market is up almost 40 percent since Election Day. So I've made a lot of these business geniuses look even better. So they like Trump. But, you know, it's been up very substantially.\nBut I believe Sweden is about the eighth largest investor in the United States, and that's quite an achievement.\nWe've been working on North Korea. Sweden has somewhat of a relationship with North Korea. We've been working with North Korea. As I said, Otto was really brought home, unfortunately in very poor condition, but Otto was brought home largely with the help of Sweden. They're terrific -- terrific people. People from Sweden, the Swedish people, are fantastic people. I have many friends in New York and Washington from Sweden, and they are fantastic people.\nThank you.\nThey really have been terrific. Really terrific.\nSaagar Enjeti, Daily Caller. Please, Saagar.\nMe. No, I think that -- (laughter). Nobody got that. (Laughter.) I think that they are sincere, but I think they're sincere also because the sanctions and what we're doing with respect to North Korea, including, you know, the great help that we've been given from China. And they can do more, but I think they've done more than, certainly, they've ever done for our country before. So China has been a big help. I think that's been a factor.\nBut the sanctions have been very, very strong and very biting. And we don't want that to happen. So I really believe they are sincere. I hope they're sincere. We're going to soon find out.\nNo, I don't really talk about that. I just said that the White House has tremendous energy. It has tremendous spirit. It is a great place to be working.\nMany, many people want every single job. You know, I read where, \"Oh, gee, maybe people don't want to work for Trump.\" And believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House. They all want a piece of that Oval Office; they want a piece of the West Wing. And not only in terms of it looks great on their résumé; it's just a great place to work.\nIt's got tremendous energy. It's tough. I like conflict. I like having two people with different points of view, and I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it's the best way to go. I like different points of view.\nBut the White House has a tremendous energy, and we have tremendous talent. Yeah, there will be people -- I'm not going to be specific -- but there will be people that change. They always change. Sometimes they want to go out and do something else. But they all want to be in the White House. So many people want to come in. I have a choice of anybody. I could take any position in the White House, and I'll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position. Everybody wants to be there.\nAnd they love this White House because we have energy like rarely before. Okay? Thank you very much.\nPlease.\nWell, the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever. But, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals. And I think you have to be really watching very closely. You don't want your system of votes to be compromised in any way. And we won't allow that to happen.\nWe're doing a very, very deep study, and we're coming out with some, I think, very strong suggestions on the '18 election. I think we're going to do very well on the '18 election, although, historically, those in the White House have a little bit of a dip. But I think we're going to do well because the economy is so good and because we're protecting our job, like -- our jobs are being protected, finally, like with what we're doing with the tariffs.\nBut the big thing would be the tax cut and the regulations cuts. Also, the judges. I mean, we have outstanding judges. Judge Gorsuch in the Supreme Court, and many, many judges going onto the bench all over the country.\nSo I think we're going to do very well, and I think it will be a tremendous surprise to people how well. The economy is so good; jobs are so good. Black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment at all-time lows. I mean, we're really doing well.\nSo based on that, I guess we should do pretty well, and I hope so. But you have to be very vigilant. And one of the things we're learning is, it's always good -- it's old-fashioned, but it's always good to have a paper back-up system of voting. It's called \"paper,\" not highly complex computers -- paper. And a lot of states are doing that. They're going to a paper backup, and I think that's a great idea.\nBut we're studying it very closely. Various agencies, including Homeland Security, are studying it very carefully.\nNo, because we'll counteract whatever they do. We'll counteract it very strongly. And we are having strong backup systems. And we've been working, actually -- we haven't been given credit for this, but we've actually been working very hard on the '18 election and the '20 election coming up. Thank you very much.\nMaybe almost everything?\nOh, I think we have very good relationships on trade. We have had, and we are constantly in touch. We have, on the military, great cooperation, including design of various components of aircraft, et cetera. And we are -- we were discussing that. We have some of the great makers of these components in the room with us today.\nNo, we have a very good relationship on trade, and we always will have. Sweden is a great country. It's small, but it's very sharp, I will tell you. They are very sharp.\nThank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-stefan-lofven-sweden"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Kersti Kaljulaid of Estonia, President Raimonds Vejonis of Latvia, and President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania", "Date": "2018-04-03", "Text": "Thank you. Today I'm honored to host the President of Estonia, the President of Latvia, and the President of Lithuania at the U.S.-Baltic Centennial Summit. Thank you all for traveling to the White House for these really important discussions. We've just spent a long time together, and it was very interesting.\nThis summit proudly displays to the world America's deep and lasting friendship with the Baltic nations. On behalf of the American people, thank you very much. And we are going to have another 100-year—a very long and beautiful relationship. This is your 100th year of independence. Congratulations.\nFor a century, the United States has stood with the people of the Baltics in support of their independence, sovereignty, and self-determination. Through the decades of brutal Soviet occupation, the United States never ceased to recognize the sovereignty of the Baltic republics. In our discussions today, I was proud to reaffirm America's commitment to the Welles Declaration of 1940 and the U.S.-Baltic Charter of 1998. These same principles lie at the heart of America's approach to world affairs, honoring the right of peaceful citizens and nations to protect their interests and chart their own wonderful destinies.\nAll three Baltic republics are committed NATO Allies. I want to express our gratitude to each of your countries for fulfilling your full obligations and meeting the 2-percent GDP benchmark for national defense this year. Your commitment to burden-sharing is an example, really, that other NATO nations and partners all around the world will have to all get together and bear. Some of them do not make the same commitment. Hopefully, they soon will. When nations are committed to peace and to security, they have to pay their share. And we will all enjoy a much more safe and prosperous future.\nBaltic countries are also providing security assistance and training as part of the coalition to defeat ISIS. The coalition has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by ISIS in Syria and in Iraq, and we will not rest until ISIS is gone.\nIn economic matters, our cooperation continues to develop and grow, as you well know. We're excited about several new opportunities for collaboration, especially in science, medicine, and technology. Immediately following this summit, the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce will host a U.S.-Baltic Business Summit to expand mutual trade and investment between our nations. And they're all looking forward to seeing you.\nThe Baltic countries remain a key market for U.S. aircraft, automobiles, machinery, and medical equipment. And we welcome increased bilateral trade with all three nations based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity.\nFinally, we are enhancing our cooperation on energy security. We're all collaborating to diversify energy sources, supplies, and routes throughout the Baltic region, including expanding exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, of which you've become a bigger and bigger user. These are just some of the many wonderful opportunities we can seize together. To all three Baltic leaders with us today, thank you again for helping to celebrate. And this is really a very great celebration because it's a historic milestone. Our friendship will continue to grow closer, and our cooperation will continue to bring about the greater security and prosperity for our citizens. And you have done terrific jobs as leaders, as Presidents of your countries. And we tell you that, for your citizens, we are there for you.\nAs we begin the next 100 years of our partnership, the Baltic republics can trust the United States will remain a strong, proud, and loyal friend and ally.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Please.\nYes. Whatever you like.\nLadies first.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you very much. Thank you very much. We'll take a few questions. We're going to also have questions specifically for the Baltics.\nSteve [Steve Holland]. Reuters.\nYes. First of all, the border. The Mexican border is very unprotected by our laws. We have horrible, horrible and very unsafe laws in the United States, and we're going to be able to do something about that, hopefully, soon. Hopefully, Congress will get their act together and get in and create some very powerful laws, like Mexico has and like Canada has and like almost all countries have.\nWe don't have laws. We have catch-and-release. You catch, and then you immediately release. And people come back years later for a court case, except they virtually never come back.\nSo we are preparing for the military to secure our border between Mexico and the United States. We have a meeting on it in a little while with General Mattis and everybody. And I think that it's something we have to do.\nNow, the caravan—which is over a thousand people, coming in from Honduras—thought they were going to just walk right through Mexico and right through the border.\nAs you know, NAFTA is a phenomenal deal for Mexico. It's been a horrible deal for the United States. We're renegotiating it now. But it has been a horrible, horrible, embarrassing deal for the United States. This should have been terminated or renegotiated many years ago.\nMexico—we have a trade deficit with Mexico of over $100 billion a year. And I told Mexico yesterday that, because of the fact that their laws are so strong, they can do things about it that, hard to believe, the United States can't. I said, \"I hope you're going tell that caravan not to get up to the border.\" And I think they're doing that, because as of 12 minutes ago, it was all being broken up. We'll see what happens. But we have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We've started building the wall. As you know, we have a billion-six [dollars]But we have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We've started building the wall. As you know, we have a billion-six [dollars]But we have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We've started building the wall. As you know, we have a billion-six [dollars]*.\nAs far as Syria is concerned, our primary mission, in terms of that, was getting rid of ISIS. We've almost completed that task, and we'll be making a decision very quickly, in coordination with others in the area, as to what we'll do. Saudi Arabia is very interested in our decision. And I said: \"Well, you know, you want us to stay? Maybe you're going to have to pay.\" But a lot of people—you know, we do a lot of things in this country. We do them for—we do them for a lot of reasons, but it's very costly for our country, and it helps other countries a hell of a lot more than it helps us.\nSo we're going to be making a decision. We've had a tremendous military success against ISIS, as you know. It's close to a hundred percent, as I just said. And we'll be making a decision as to what we do in the very near future. We'll be consulting, also, with groups of our people and groups of our allies. Okay?\nSay it?\nI want to get out. I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our Nation. We will have, as of 3 months ago, $7 trillion in the Middle East over the last 17 years. We get nothing—nothing—out of it. Nothing. And as you remember in civilian life, for years I said, \"Keep the oil.\" I was always saying, \"Keep the oil.\" We didn't keep the oil. Who got the oil? It was ISIS got the oil, a lot of it. That's what funded their campaigns. They took a lot of the oil, and it was largely responsible for funding. We should have kept the oil then. We didn't keep the oil.\nSo I want to get back. I want to rebuild our Nation. Think of it: $7 trillion over a 17-year period; we have nothing—nothing—except death and destruction. It's a horrible thing. So it's time. It's time. We were very successful against ISIS. We'll be successful against anybody militarily. But sometimes, it's time to come back home, and we're thinking about that very seriously. Okay? Thank you.\nBaltic States-U.S. Relations\nWell, we have a very strong relationship, as the Presidents will tell you, with the Baltic States. And we are with them. We're friends, and we're allies. And we are going to have a long-term, very fine relationship. In addition, we do business on trade. We work very hard on security together. Surprisingly, large numbers of trade. These are very industrious nations. Now, you're from there so you know exactly what I'm talking about. These are tremendous people, and very, very industrious. We do a lot of business on trade.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\nOkay. Thank you. Would you like to choose somebody, President?\nI think all three would be great places to invest: stable governments, incredible people—hard-working, industrious people. I think they would be great places to invest. I would have no problem with it. Although, I think as President of the United States, they would call it a slight conflict of interest, perhaps. [Laughter] You might be hearing from these people.\nNo, I think it would be a great place. I think all three would be a great place to invest. Okay?\nThank you.\nWell, I think we'll be able to have great dialogue, I hope. And if we can't, you'll be the first to know about it. Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. And you can—and I know you're nodding yes, because everyone agrees when they think about it—strong energy, the United States. My opponent was into other forms of energy, like windmills. We're very strong on energy. We're, essentially, now energy independent. We're an exporter of energy. That is not a positive for Russia, but it's certainly a positive for the United States. We just passed a $700 billion military budget; next year, $716 billion, the largest ever passed. We are going to have a military stronger than we've ever had before, by far. That's not exactly a great thing for Russia, but that's the way it is. We're going to have the strongest military that we ever had.\nOkay.\nGood. Pick a reporter, please. You can pick a reporter, a Baltic reporter, ideally. [Laughter] Real news, not fake news. Go ahead.\nDo you want to pick? I think we have enough. Do we have enough? Yes? Go ahead. Pick—Mr. President, pick a reporter from the Baltics. Not the same man; he was very tough. Go ahead, pick a reporter.\nYes, go ahead. Yes, please.\nI just want to conclude by saying that I am very impressed with these three great Baltic nations and these three great Presidents. Thank you very much for being here\nThank you, everybody. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-kersti-kaljulaid-estonia-president-raimonds"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Palm Beach, Florida", "Date": "2018-04-18", "Text": "Thank you very much. I want to begin today by expressing my deep condolences to the entire Bush family on the passing of former First Lady Barbara Bush, a wonderful, wonderful person. For decades, Barbara was a titan in American life. Her presence and character were engraved into America's identity.\nHer strength and toughness really embodied the spirit of our country. And her warmth and devotion earned the admiration of an entire Nation and, indeed, the entire world. She was a tireless champion for literacy. She was a fierce advocate for the American family. And she was a woman of proud patriotism and profound faith.\nOur hearts are saddened by her passing, but our spirits are lifted by the memories of her goodness and her grace. She was a good person. Melania and I send our prayers to Barbara's husband of 73 years—I'll never beat that record—President George H.W. Bush; to the surviving children Jeb and Neil and Marvin, Dorothy, and former President George W. Bush; and to their many wonderful grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\nThank you very much, Shinzo. Appreciate it.\nThank you, Mark, very much. The fact is that they do have three prisoners. We have been talking about them. We are negotiating now. We are doing our very best. As you know, they've been there a long time, and it's harsh treatment. We fought very hard to get Otto Warmbier back. And when we came back, he was in very, very bad condition. It was a very sad event.\nWe are likewise fighting very diligently to get the three American citizens back. I think there's a good chance of doing it. We're having very good dialogue. We will keep you informed. But we are in there, and we are working very hard on that.\nWe have come a long way with North Korea. We were, as you know—and when I say \"we\", for many years, they've been talking to North Korea and nothing has happened. This should have been taken care of by past administrations when they were not nearly so far along. But we put unbelievably powerful sanctions on and many other things.\nI want to thank publicly President Xi of China, who has done more for us than he's done for any other administration or than any leader of China has done for any President or administration. He has clogged up the border, as you know, and he's done it very, very powerfully. He would tell you himself that he never thought he would go to this extent, and I appreciate that very much. But it's put a lot of pressure on.\nAnd, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come in from China. And President Xi understands that this is a very important set of months that are lying ahead. He doesn't want to see a Korea—North Korea or any Korea—that has nuclear weapons either. So he's also fighting for China when it comes to this. But he has been terrific. Can he be better? I always say yes, he can be better. I said: \"President, you've been great. Can you be better? Yes.\" But he's been very good, and it's had a big impact. And what we've done has had a big impact.\nSo we've never been in a position like this with that regime, whether it's father, grandfather, or son. And I hope to have a very successful meeting. If we don't think it's going to be successful, Mark, we won't have it. We won't have it. If I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we're not going to go. If the meeting, when I'm there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting, and we'll continue what we're doing or whatever it is that we'll continue. But something will happen. So I like always remaining flexible, and we'll remain flexible here. I've gotten it to this point. President Moon of South Korea was very generous when he said, if it weren't for Donald Trump, the Olympics would have been a total failure. It was my involvement and the involvement of our great country that made the Olympics a very successful Olympics. If you look at ticket sales prior to what took place with respect to North Korea, it was going to be a big problem, and it turned out to be a very successful Olympics.\nSo we've gotten us here, and I think we're going to be successful. But if for any reason I feel we're not, we end. Okay? Thank you, Mark.\nI will add that the 232, having to do with aluminum and steel tariffs—30 percent, in one case; 25 percent and 10 percent—that it's got us to the bargaining table with many nations, and, in other cases, they're paying. And it's billions of dollars coming into the coffers of the United States. So they've been, actually, very important.\nIf you look at what we did with solar panels, where we put 30 percent tariffs on, we had 32 companies opened with pretty new plants, because it's a relatively new industry. Of the 32 plants, 30 were closed, and 2 were not doing well. Since putting the tariffs on, the two are doing very well, seven or eight are going to be opening, and a lot more will open.\nSame thing with washing machines. We were, believe it not, having washing machines dumped all over the country. We put tariffs on, and we're now opening up and expanding companies that create and make—which is actually a very big business—washing machines and dryers.\nSo the workers of our country know what's happening. We have companies moving up from Mexico, automobile companies, and they're building new plants in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Kentucky and expanding their plants. A lot of things are happening. Our country is doing very, very well. And it's going to continue. It's going to continue. A lot of great momentum.\nIf you look at any chart, the enthusiasm for business in our country is at an alltime high. And unemployment, for African American workers, for Hispanic workers, unemployment is at an alltime low. In history, in the history of our country, it's at the lowest point. If you look at unemployment for women, it's at an 18-year low. So we're very proud of our achievements.\nAnd starting know, as you see, over the last few weeks, the tax cuts are kicking in. And it's a beautiful thing to see. And people are spending money where they didn't have the money to spend previously. So we're very happy with that.\nShinzo, please.\nJapanese Citizens Held Captive in North KoreaQ.I'm—[inaudible]. Now, I'd like to ask a question about how to handle North Korean issues. Prime Minister Abe, the coordination for holding summits between the South Korea and North Korea, as well between the U.S. and North Korea, is underway, there is a concern in Japan that Japan may be left behind. So how are you going to proceed with dialogue with North Korea?\nPresident Trump, you talked about the abduction issue. Are you going to consider the nuclear weapons disarmament the same level as abduction issue?\nWell, maybe I'll go first. Abduction is a very important issue for me because it's very important to your Prime Minister. I will tell you that we were having dinner last night, and he started talking about abduction and how horrible it was. And his level of enthusiasm was unbelievable. And I said to him right then and there last night at the table, I said we will work very hard on that issue, and we will try and bring those folks back home. Very, very hard.\nAnd we will be very loyal to Japan. Thank you.\nJennifer Jacobs [Bloomberg News].\nInvestigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein\nThank you very much. The United States has a massive trade deficit with Japan. It's anywhere from $69 billion to $100 billion a year. That's massive by any standpoint. We are doing 232 on steel and aluminum. And if we can come to an arrangement on a new deal between the United States and Japan, that would certainly be something we would discuss, aluminum tariffs and steel tariffs. And I would look forward to being able to, at some point in the future, take them off.\nBut right now we have a deficit that's a minimum of $69 billion a year. Japan sends us millions and millions of cars, and we tax them virtually not at all. And we don't send so much product, because we have trade barriers and lots of other things. So these are the things that the Prime Minister and I are going to be discussing over the next short period of time.\nThe media has not covered the TPP correctly. I don't want to go back into TPP, but if they offered us a deal that I can't refuse, on behalf of the United States, I would do it. But I like bilateral better. I think it's better for our country. I think it's better for our workers. And I much would prefer a bilateral deal, a deal directly with Japan. We already have a deal with 6 of the 11 nations in the TPP. So we already have trade deals, and the others we can make very easily. They're all calling wanting to make a deal. But we think that's much better for us.\nSo unless they offer us a deal that we cannot refuse, I would not go back into TPP. We'll see what happens. But in the meantime, we're negotiating. And what I really prefer is negotiating a one-on-one deal with Japan. And that's where we are right now, and I will say that the representatives who are sitting right here are extraordinarily competent and very tough, those representing Japan. And we will hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, have a very good deal, good for Japan and good for the United States. Okay?\nThank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much, Shinzo.\nYes, we'll do sanctions. As soon as they very much deserve it, we will have—that is a question. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than President Donald Trump. Between building up the military, between creating tremendous vast amounts of oil. We raised billions and billions of dollars extra in NATO. We had a very, very severe—we were talking about it a little while—fight in Syria recently, a month ago, between our troops and Russian troops, and that's very sad. But many people died in that fight. There has been nobody tougher than me. With the media, no matter what I did, it's never tough enough, because that's their narrative. But Russia will tell you, there has been nobody tougher than Donald Trump. And then, the other night, we had a strike in Syria, which was absolute precision.\nI leave it with this, with all of that said: If we can get along with China, and if we can get along with Russia, and if we can get along with Japan and other nations, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. Just remember that. If we got along with other nations, that's good, not bad.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shinzo-abe-japan-palm-beach-florida"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France", "Date": "2018-04-24", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Melania and I are truly honored to welcome French President Macron and Mrs. Macron to the White House. Thank you very much. It's a great honor.\nWe're thrilled that the first official state visit of my Presidency is not only with a great friend, but with a leader of America's oldest ally, the Republic of France. Today, in our Nation's Capital, the Stars and Stripes proudly fly alongside the tricolor flag, a symbol of the world—and to the world, of unity, fraternity, and friendship that forever links our nations together.\nForty years after the end of our War of Independence, the great General Lafayette traveled to George Washington's home at Mount Vernon to visit the grave of the father of our country. President Macron, we're deeply moved that nearly two centuries later, the President of the Republic of France made that same tribute last night. That was a beautiful evening. Thank you.\n[At this point, President Macron spoke in English.]\nThank you very much. This past summer, Melania and I had an incredible visit with you and Brigitte in Paris to celebrate Bastille Day. We were awed by the beauty of your country and the grateful hospitality of your incredible people. They are incredible people.\nTogether, we commemorated the 100th anniversary of America's entry into the First World War. We remembered the French and American patriots who shed their blood together in defense of civilization. Their noble sacrifice will echo through time forever, an immortal tribute to our people and to our freedom.\nDuring the horror of the First World War, more than 1 million people were killed or injured from chemical warfare. In the aftermath of that horror, civilized nations came together to ban chemical weapons. Two weeks ago, following Syrian dictator Bashar al-Asad's barbaric use of chemical weapons against his own people, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom joined together to strike at the heart of the Syrian chemical weapons program. These actions were designed to establish a strong deterrent against the use of these heinous weapons.\nPresident Macron, I thank you for your leadership in this effort. And it was a well-executed effort at that. And I thank you and the members of the French military for their courage and their great skill.\nThe United States and France are also cooperating to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We are grateful for France's key partnership in our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime. As you know, I will soon be meeting with Kim Jong Un as we seek a future of peace, harmony, and security for the whole Korean Peninsula and, in fact, for the whole world. However, in pursuit of peace, we will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations. The campaign of maximum pressure will continue. France and the United States also agree that Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon, and that regime must end its support for terrorism all over. Nowhere—no matter where you go in the Middle East, you see the fingerprints of Iran behind problems.\nI also want to thank President Macron for France's vital contribution to our very successful campaign against ISIS. As we drive these ISIS killers from Syria, it is essential that the responsible nations of the Middle East step up their own contributions to prevent Iran from profiting off the success of our anti-ISIS effort. Very rich countries are in the Middle East. They have to make major contributions. They have not been doing it as they should. A major topic that we discussed a little while ago: They have to step up tremendously—not a little bit, but tremendously—their financial effort.\nPlease.\n[President Macron spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nI like him a lot. [Laughter] First of all, I want to thank—I want to thank our Vice President and Karen for being here. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nNo, we had a wonderful conference today, and I think especially the one-on-one in the Oval office—we covered a lot of territory having to do with trade, having to do with Iran, and various other subjects. So I think a lot of good things are going to come out of our meeting, and I appreciate you being here.\nI will take a couple of questions. How about Jeff Mason from Reuters? Jeff. Go ahead, Jeff. Hi, Jeff.\nWell, we will start with your second part of the question. And I hope that we will be able to deal in a very open and honorable fashion with North Korea. I started a process, and when I did, everybody thought I was doing it absolutely wrong. But in the meantime, for 25 years, people have been dealing, and nothing happened. And a lot is happening right now. I can tell you that, Jeff. A lot is happening. And I think it's going to be very positive. And I hope it's going to be very positive for North Korea and for South Korea and Japan and the rest of the world.\nBut I am starting at a level that, frankly, I shouldn't have had to start. This should have been worked out a long time ago. This should have been worked out many years ago. We were discussing that. We shouldn't be having this situation happen to the United States and the world. This should have been resolved by other Presidents and by other leaders of other countries a long time ago.\nWith that being said, I think we're doing very well. Meetings are being set up. And I want to see denuclearization of North Korea. A lot of concessions have already been made. We have made no concessions, despite some of the media saying that I've made concessions. I don't—I haven't even discussed a concession other than the fact that meeting is a great thing. And I'm sure that a lot of other people would have liked to have had the position we're having.\nI will say this: We put the strongest sanctions on a country that we ever have put on any country, by far. China, President Xi, has been very strong in helping us to solve this problem, in his case, at the border. He's allowing very little to get through.\nI think he's doing that for a number of reasons. We have a very good relationship, and also, it's very important in terms of trade, because I do play the trade card. If you look at what's happening with trade in China, it hasn't been fair for many, many years to the United States, and we're going to solve that problem. In fact, we're having Secretary Mnuchin and a couple of other folks heading over to—Bob Lighthizer—heading over to China, at the request of China. They came here, as you know, last week. And we're having very substantive discussions on trade.\nBut I think it all plays to the border and the fact that they have been extremely strong on the border and very little has gotten through, much to the surprise of a lot of people. And I believe the trade will work out, but I also think that China has never treated us with more respect than they have over the last short period of time that I'm President. I have a very excellent, as you know, relationship with President Xi. And I think that relationship is very important as to what's happening with North Korea.\nSo the end result is, we'll see. Maybe good things will happen, and maybe we're all wasting a lot of time. But hopefully, it will be good for everybody concerned.\nAs far as Syria is concerned, I would love to get out. I'd love to bring our incredible warriors back home. They've done a great job. We've essentially just absolutely obliterated ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. And we've done a big favor to neighboring countries, frankly, but we've also done a favor for our country.\nWith that being said, Emmanuel and myself have discussed the fact that we don't want to give Iran open season to the Mediterranean, especially since we really control it. To a large extent, we really have controlled it, and we've set control on it. So we'll see what happens.\nBut we're going to be coming home relatively soon. We finished, at least, almost our work with respect to ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, and we have done a job that nobody has been able to do.\nBut with that being said, I do want to come home. But I want to come home also with having accomplished what we have to accomplish. So we are discussing Syria as part of an overall deal. When they made the Iran deal, what they should have done is included Syria. When I say \"should have\"—before giving them, Iran, $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash—$1.8 million in cash. If you think about this, before giving this kind of tremendous money, okay—$150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash—in barrels, I hear, it was taken out, and in boxes it was taken out—cash—they should have made a deal that covered Yemen, that covered Syria, that covered other parts of the Middle East where Iraq is involved—where Iran is involved. They didn't do that.\nSo we want to come home. We'll be coming home. But we want to have a very, very strong—we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint, and that was a very big part of our discussion. Okay? Thank you.\nIt means they get rid of their nukes. [Laughter] Very simple. They get rid of their nukes, and nobody else would say it. It would be very easy for me to make a simple deal and claim victory. I don't want to do that. I want them to get rid of their nukes. Okay?\nAnd I think we will have a great shot at doing a much bigger maybe deal, maybe not deal. We're going to find out, but we'll know fairly soon.\nAnd if I might add, they—states and, as I alluded to—that—and countries that are in the area, some of which are immensely wealthy, would not be there except for the United States and, to a lesser extent, France. But they wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what's happening, because I don't think France or the United States should be liable for the tremendous cost.\nThe United States is embarrassingly into the Middle East. As of a few months ago, as you've heard me say before—and I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to—$7 trillion. And when we want to build, Mr. President, our infrastructure, everybody says, \"Oh, we want to be careful with our money.\" When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things—tunnels, bridges—they say, \"Oh, let's be careful with our money.\" And yet we have spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, and we've gotten nothing for it. Nothing. Less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned. That's over an 18-year period.\nThe countries that are there, that you all know very well, are immensely wealthy; they're going to have to pay for this. And I think the President and I agree very much on that. And they will pay for it. They will pay for it. We've spoken to them. They will pay for it. The United States will not continue to pay. And they will also put soldiers on the ground, which they're not doing. And we will, in fact, bring lots of people home. We will have a strong blockage to the Mediterranean, which to me is very important—because if we don't, you have Iran going right to the Mediterranean. Not going to have that.\nBut there is a chance—and nobody knows what I'm going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea—but we'll see. But we'll see also, if I do what some people expect, whether or not it will be possible to do a new deal with solid foundations. Because this a deal with decayed foundations. It's a bad deal. It's a bad structure. It's falling down. Should have never, ever been made. I blame Congress. I blame a lot of people for it. But it should have never been made, and we're going to see what happens on the 12th.\nBut I will say, if Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like few countries have ever paid. Okay?\nYes, John. Please. John Roberts of Fox.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs-Designate Ronny L. Jackson/Senate Confirmation Process\nWell, I haven't heard of the particular allegations, but I will tell you he's one of the finest people that I have met, and I think speaking for Melania, also. He's been the doctor for President Obama, I believe for President Bush, for me. I've gotten to know him pretty well. He's a great doctor.\nAnd it was a suggestion. Now, I know there's an experience problem, because lack of experience. But there's an experience problem—the Veterans Administration is very important to me. We've done a great job with it, as you know, with the Accountability Act and many other things. Now we're working on choice. It's going to happen. We're going to take great care of our veterans. That's a very, very important thing, and we've done a great job.\nBut I told Admiral Jackson just a little while ago, I said, \"What do you need this for?\" This is a vicious group of people that malign—and they do. And I've lived through it; we all lived through it. You people are getting record ratings because of it, so congratulations. But I said, \"What do you need it for?\" He's an admiral. He's a great leader. And they questioned him about every little thing. As you know, with the success of what will, hopefully, soon be Secretary of State Pompeo, everybody was very surprised. I heard 10 minutes before the vote yesterday on committee that, \"He will not be approved at committee\"—which would be the first time in many, many decades that something like that would have happened with regard to a Secretary of State—except I spoke to Rand Paul, and Rand Paul has really never let me down. He—Rand Paul is a good man. And I knew things that nobody else knew. And Rand Paul said, \"I'm going to change my vote,\" and he voted, and everybody was surprised. And he actually got an 11-to-9 vote, because as you know, Johnny Isakson's vote counts if it isn't the deciding vote. So it was actually a 11-to-9 with, I believe, an—there was one vote—what would you call that, John?\nNot present.\nOh, it's called \"present.\" Okay. So it was 11-to-9 and that was a terrific thing. But they failed to stop him. So now they say: \"Who's next? Who's next?\" And this person, Admiral Jackson—Dr. Jackson—he's a wonderful man. I said to him, \"What do you need it for?\" And as far as experience is concerned, the Veterans Administration—which is approximately 13 million people—is so big, you could run the biggest hospital system in the world, and it's small time compared to the Veterans Administration. So nobody has the experience.\nWhat he is is a leader and a good man. But I told him—I said, \"You know what, Doc? You're too fine a person.\" His son is a top student at Annapolis. He's a high-quality person. I said, \"What do you need it for?\" So he'll be making—it's totally his decision—but he'll be making a decision.\nBut they failed with Mike Pompeo, and that was a big, big hit because they thought they could stop him and embarrass. The Democrats have become obstructionists. That's all they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They have bad ideas. They have bad politics. The one thing they do is obstruct. And that's why I'm waiting for—you would never believe this—I'm waiting for very good people like the Ambassador to Germany. Hasn't been approved yet. It's been in there for 11 or 12 months.\nWe have Angela Merkel coming to the United States on Friday. We still don't have our Ambassador approved. And at this rate—and many of the papers checked it out yesterday, and they actually said I was right—but it would be 9 years before these people are approved. We have hundreds of people in waiting to be approved, and the Democrats are taking 30 hours per person. They're taking the maximum time. They are obstructions. That's very bad for our country.\nI said to Dr. Jackson, \"What do you need it for?\" So we'll see what happens. I don't want to put a man through—who's not a political person. I don't want to put a man through a process like this. It's too ugly and too disgusting. So we'll see what happens. He'll make a decision.\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs-Designate Ronny L. Jackson\nOh, I would definitely stand behind him. He's a fine man. I'll always stand behind him. I'd let it be his choice. But here's a man who has just been an extraordinary person. His family, extraordinary success. Great doctor. Great everything. And he has to listen to the abuse that he has to—I wouldn't if I were him. Actually, in many ways, I'd love to be him. [Laughter] But the fact is, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it. What does he need it for? To be abused by a bunch of politicians that aren't thinking nicely about our country? I really don't think, personally, he should do it. But it's totally his—I would stand behind him—totally his decision.\nWe've pretty much finished with ISIS, and we're going to be making some big decisions in a very short period of time. But we're working very closely together with France and with the President. Okay? Thank you very much.\n[A reporter and President Macron spoke in French, and their remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nFrance-U.S. RelationsQ.Mr. President, BFM Television. President Macron, for a year now, you've enjoyed a very friendly relationship with President Trump. Quite unusual, compared to the previous Presidents. At the same time, we can see that you do not agree on a number of topics. There are more and more of them. We've seen that openly in the Oval Office earlier on Iran. It seems like the initial deal with Iran will not be able to be saved. So what about this relationship? Can it have some concrete impact on France? Can it be beneficial to France and to Europe? You talked about reciprocal interests. Is that really the case today?\nWell, I think that we have very much in common, I must say. I think many things that we—certainly, most things we agreed with, we can change, and we can be flexible. You know, in life you have to be flexible. And as leaders of countries, you have to show flexibility. And I think we actually get along on many of the subjects we discussed today. And I will say, France is a great country. And I believe France will be taken to new heights under this President. He's going to be an outstanding President, one of your great Presidents. And it's an honor to call you my friend. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany", "Date": "2018-04-27", "Text": "Thank you very much. Today I'm honored to welcome Chancellor Angela Merkel back to the White House. Over the past year, I have enjoyed getting to know the Chancellor very well through many productive calls, discussions, and meetings. We have a great relationship.\nChancellor, I want to congratulate you once again on your election victory, fourth term in office. It's really something. Congratulations.\nWe're also pleased to have our newly confirmed United States Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, an outstanding man, and he's with us today. And, Richard, congratulations. Do a great job. And I know you will. Thank you.\nThis confirmation was long overdue. We've been waiting a long time for Richard to get his clearance, and he got it. And it's going to be special. But we have a lot of people that are awaiting approval. And the Democrats have been treating us extremely unfairly, and they're going to have to move it along.\nFor decades, the alliance and friendship between Germany and the United States has advanced the cause of peace, prosperity, and freedom. Today, our nations face a wide array of shared challenges and opportunities, and I am confident that we will meet them together with the same strength and resolve that has always defined the United States-German friendship.\nThis afternoon I want to congratulate the Republic of Korea on its historic summit with North Korea. We're encouraged by President Moon and Kim Jong Un's expressed goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks. We look forward to that. And hopefully, it will be productive.\nI want to thank Chancellor Merkel for her leadership in our campaign of maximum pressure on the North Korean regime, which has helped us to reach this important step, this moment where we are right now. It's taken a long time—many, many decades—to get here. Let's see what happens.\nWe seek a future of peace, prosperity, and harmony for the whole Korean Peninsula, unlocking not only a brighter future for the people of Korea, but for the people of the world. However, in pursuit of that goal, we will not repeat the mistake of past administrations. Maximum pressure will continue until denuclearization occurs. I looked forward to our meeting. It should be quite something.\nIn our meetings today, the Chancellor and I discussed Iran. The Iranian regime fuels violence, bloodshed, and chaos all across the Middle East. We must ensure that this murderous regime does not even get close to a nuclear weapon and that Iran ends its proliferation of dangerous missiles and its support for terrorism. No matter where you go in the Middle East, wherever there's a problem, Iran is right there.\nAs we eradicate what little remains of ISIS in Syria, we must also ensure that Iran does not profit from our success. To prevent this outcome, it is essential that our coalition and regional partners step up their financial and military contributions to the anti-ISIS efforts. Some of these countries are immensely wealthy, and they're going to start paying for it and paying for this tremendous help that we've given them.\nThe Chancellor and I also had a productive discussion about the security of Europe and the responsibility of European nations to properly contribute to their own defense. We addressed the need to strengthen NATO and the NATO alliance by ensuring that all member states honor their commitment to spend 2 percent—and hopefully, much more—of GDP on defense.\nIt is essential that our NATO allies increase their financial contributions so that everyone is paying their fair share. We look forward to seeing further progress towards improved burden sharing. And a lot of people have stepped up; a lot of countries have stepped up, and they're going to have to continue to do so. A tremendous amount of additional money has been raised for NATO over the past 16 months, and I'm proud to have helped. But they have to keep going.\nIn this age of international crime, smuggling, terrorism, and trafficking, it is also essential that we have strong border security and immigration control. This is fundamental to national defense.\nAlso vital to our security and that of our allies is America's ability to maintain a strong and robust manufacturing base, which we really are doing in the United States. We have additional steel plants opening. Steel plants are expanding. Aluminum is doing great. A lot of things are happening that were never going to happen before.\nThat's why we must have a fair and reciprocal trading relationship with our friends and partners. We have a trade deficit in goods with the European Union of approximately—hard to believe—$151 billion a year, including a $50 billion annual trade deficit in autos and auto parts. I'm committed to working with Chancellor Merkel to reduce barriers for United States exports to remedy these trade imbalances and deepen our economic ties.\nWe also welcome the Chancellor's partnership in promoting major reforms to international organizations like the World Trade Organization—which has not treated the United States well—to protect sovereignty and ensure fairness.\nThe close cooperation across multiple fronts—military, intelligence, economic, academic—is critical to the defense of our civilization as we know it. And the close friendship between the German and American people enriches the lives of millions and millions of our citizens.\nChancellor, thank you again for visiting the White House. It's an honor to have you. Our alliance is strong and thriving. And together, we will overcome shared obstacles, seize upon shared opportunities, and build an incredible future for our country and our people.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Chancellor, thank you very much.\nThank you very much, Angela. Thank you very much.\nAll right, we'll take some questions. Blake Burman [Fox Business Network]. Yes? Blake.\n——but we have a very good working relationship. We're setting up a meeting. Things have changed very radically from a few months ago, you know, the name-calling and a lot of other things. We get a kick every once and a while out of the fact that I'll be watching people that failed so badly over the last 25 years explaining to me how to make a deal with North Korea. I get a big, big kick out of that.\nBut we are doing very well. I think that something very dramatic could happen. They're treating us with great respect. And you know, what's going on with South Korea—and I think President Moon of South Korea was very generous in saying that we helped make the Olympics a great success, because of the fact that, as you know, there was a tremendous animosity, there was a tremendous problem going on. And all of a sudden, people started buying tickets because—whole different feeling when North said, \"We'd love to go to the Olympics.\"\nSo a lot of good things are happening with respect to North Korea. President Obama told me—when I had the one meeting with him—he said: \"That's your biggest problem. That's going to be the most difficult thing you have.\" And honestly, I wish it was handled earlier. I wish it were handled by another administration years ago. I'm not just talking about President Obama. I go back to any administration you want. But over the last 25 years, this should have been handled a long time ago, not now. This should not have been left for me to handle.\nBut we will handle it. We're handling it well. And hopefully, there will peace for North Korea, South Korea, Germany—I mean, everything is included—Japan. The Chancellor has been very helpful in the maximum pressure campaign, as I said. Really, very helpful. So have many other nations.\nPresident Xi of China has been really good at the border. Everyone is surprised at how tight he clamped down. Everyone said that he'd just talk about it, he wouldn't do it. Well, he did it, and he did it out a relationship that we have and also out of the fact that we're negotiating trade deals, and I think that's also very important to him. Hopefully, we'll come up with something that's good for both countries.\nSo I think some very good things can happen with respect to North Korea. We're setting up meetings now. We're down to two countries, as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is.\nDo you have a question for the Chancellor?\nI think I have a responsibility. I think other Presidents should have done it. I think the responsibility has fallen on the shoulders of the President of the United States. And I think we have—I think I have a responsibility to see if I can do it. And if I can't do it, it will be a very tough time for a lot of countries and a lot of people.\nIt's certainly something that I hope I can do for the world. This is beyond the United States. This is a world problem, and it's something that I hope I'm able to do for the world. Okay?\nTough question.\nOkay?\nI don't talk about whether or not I'd use military force. That's not appropriate to be talking about. But I can tell you this: They will not be doing nuclear weapons. That I can tell you. Okay? They're not going to be doing nuclear weapons. You can bank on it.\nBen Kennedy, please. CBN.\nFormer Secretary of Veterans Affairs Nominee Ronny L. Jackson\nRonny Jackson—admiral, doctor—is one of the finest men that I've met over the last long period of time. High quality. High-quality family. I just met them. And I explained what happened. I explained that Washington can be a very mean place. You don't know about that, Chancellor. [Laughter] A nasty place.\nThe false accusations that were made about him by Senator Tester, from a great State—I don't think that State is going to put up with it. These were false accusations about a great man, about a man who has a son who is a top student at Annapolis, about a man that's given his life to this country and to the military. A brave man. He would have been a great leader.\nTo say the kind of things that he said—you had President Obama giving him an A-plus report. You had President Bush giving him an A-plus report. You have President Trump giving him an A-plus report. And to make statements of things that most people said never happened, never even happened. Calling him names was, to me, a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.\nAnd I think it's something we learn from. I called him today. I said, in a certain way—in a very big way, you're an American hero because you've exposed the system for some horrible things. I've had it happen to me with the Russian collusion hoax. It's a hoax.\nBut I came into the job understanding that things happen. He didn't. He's a great doctor. He's a great admiral. He didn't really think a thing like this could happen. And I think it's a disgrace.\nSo I just want to comment on that. And actually, I'm glad you asked the question. I think this man has been treated—he's an American hero, and I think he's been treated very unfairly. Okay?\nI have many people that want the position, if you can believe it, with all of this being said. We have some excellent people, some very political people, some people that a thing like that wouldn't happen, or if it did happen, I guess they'll handle it somewhat differently.\nBut we have many people that want that job. We're very proud of the job we've done for the veterans. The veterans have been—we've gotten accountability approved, which is something that, for years—for years they've been trying to get. As you know, they couldn't get it approved. We got accountability so that when somebody treats our veterans badly, we can fire them so fast, almost as fast as they fire people in Germany. [Laughter] We'll get rid of them.\nAnd I will tell you, we're getting choice. We're putting choice in very, very strongly. We have tremendous support in the Senate for that.\nBut I do—I have a lot of people that want the job. We're getting—we're doing a great job over there for the vets. And you know, that was one of the things that to me was the most important. We had tremendous support from the vets. We're getting great reports.\nBut getting a thing such as accountability done. We'll be soon getting choice done—meaning if a veteran stands on line and can't get to a doctor for various reasons, they're going to a private doctor, and this country is going to pay. They're not going to wait 9 weeks on line for a cure to something that could have been very easy to cure, and then they end up dying from it. So we're going to—I've very proud of what we've done.\nAnd I will tell you, your new head of the VA is going to be very exceptional. We have some exceptional people that want to do the job. Okay?\nSo they came to me—it's is a little bit about government. Somebody said, \"Could I tell this story?\" And they came to me with a proposal for a $1 billion Embassy in Jerusalem. And the papers—Mike Pence can tell you—the papers were put before me to sign an application for more than $1 billion to build an Embassy. I said, \"What are you talking about, a billion dollars?\" You know, most Embassies are, like, a single story. And they said: \"Yes, sir. It's $1 billion.\" And I had my name half signed, and then I noticed the figure, and I didn't—I never got to the word \"Trump.\" [Laughter] I had \"Donald\" signed, but I never got to the word \"Trump.\"\nAnd I called my Ambassador, who's a great lawyer—most people in business know David Friedman; he's the Ambassador to Israel. And loves Israel. Loves our country; loves Israel too. And I said, \"What's this $1 billion?\" He said, \"I can build it for $150,000.\" I said, \"What?\" He said, \"I can build it for $150,000\"—the Embassy. \"We have a building, we have the site. We already own the site; we own the building. I can take a corner of the building, and for $150,000 we can fix it up, make it beautiful, open our Embassy. Instead of in 10 years from now, we can open it up in 3 months.\" And that's what we did.\nBut I said: \"David, let's not go from a billion dollars to 150,000. Let's go to three, four-hundred-thousand.\" And that's what we did. We take a piece of the building—it's going to be beautiful. And it will be somewhat temporary, but it could be for many years—because by the time they build it the other way it's going to be many, many years. They were looking for sites; we already have a site. And we have a great site. The site is better than anything you could imagine. But that's the way government works. They were going to spend a billion dollars, and we're going to spend much less than a half-a-million. Could have done it for much less than that, but I said, \"Let's make it really nice.\" So that's what it is.\nI may go. Very proud of it. Jerusalem has been a subject that's been promised for many years, as you know, the Embassy in Jerusalem. It's been promised for many, many years by Presidents. They all made campaign promises, and they never had the courage to carry it out. I carried it out. So I may go. It's getting ready to open.\nAnd I do want to tell that story, though, because there are a couple of people that got to see it, including Mike, but others, where literally they were going to spend a billion dollars. And we're spending a tiny, tiny fraction of that in the hundreds of thousands of dollars instead. And it will be very nice. Maybe it will be nicer than a billion-dollar building. Okay?\nFor the Chancellor, please.\nThank you, Chancellor. We need a reciprocal relationship, which we don't have. The United States, right now, has a trade deficit with the European Union of $151 billion. And the Chancellor and I have discussed it today at length, and we're working on it. And we want to make it more fair and the Chancellor wants to make it more fair.\nSame thing with NATO. We have a far greater burden than we should have. Other countries should be paying more. And I'm not saying Germany alone; other countries should be paying more. I mean, we're protecting Europe, and yet we pay by far more than anybody else. A NATO is wonderful, but it helps Europe more than it helps us. And why are we paying a vast majority of the costs?\nSo we're working on those things. It's been unfair. And I don't blame the Chancellor and I don't blame Germany. I don't even blame the European Union. I blame the people that preceded me for allowing this to happen. There's no way we should have a trade deficit of $151 billion.\nSo we're going to make it reciprocal. We're going to make it a much more fair situation. And I think, in the end, everybody is going to be very happy. I think both countries—I view this as many countries—but looking at it as one bloc will really benefit. There's tremendous potential between the European Union and the United States, and I think that's going to happen. There's also tremendous benefit to NATO when people pay what they have to be paying.\nSome countries actually pay more than they're supposed to. They think the United States is—I've been told by numerous countries, Poland being one. Poland is great. I mean, they pay, actually, a little bit more than they're supposed to be paying, or have to pay, because they feel the United States is more than carrying the load, and perhaps they feel it's not fair. But it's something we very much appreciate.\nBut I believe that, you know, when I look at the numbers in Germany and some other countries, they may not like Donald Trump, but you have to understand, that means I'm doing a good job because I'm representing the United States. Angela is representing Germany. She's doing a fantastic job. My predecessors did not do a very good job. But we'll try and catch you. Okay? [Laughter] We'll try. We're going to have a reciprocal relationship, and it's going to be something that benefits all of us.\nOkay? Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Angela, thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-chancellor-angela-merkel-germany-6"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria", "Date": "2018-04-30", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I'm honored to host President Buhari of Nigeria at the White House, right here in the beautiful Rose Garden. President Buhari, I want thank you very much for traveling to Washington for these important discussions. It's a true pleasure to welcome you to our Nation's Capital.\nNigeria is the largest democracy in Africa. As I conveyed to President Buhari in our discussions, the United States deeply values and appreciates Nigeria's role as a strong, democratic leader in the region. The United States is currently working to expand trade and commercial ties with African nations, including Nigeria, to create jobs and wealth in all of our countries. We hope to be the economic partner of choice for nations across the continent and all around the world. And you see what's happening with respect to trade and the United States. We are being respected again.\nI hope all African countries and countries throughout the world, that we also will be supporting you and that they will likewise support us in our bid, along with Canada and Mexico, for the 2026 World Cup. We will be watching very closely, and any help that they could give us in that bid we would appreciate.\nI'm pleased that Nigeria is one of our largest trading partners in the region, and we look forward to growing our trade relationship based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. But we give Nigeria well over $1 billion in aid every year. And we have already started talking with the President about taking down the trade barriers—very substantial barriers—to the United States trading with Nigeria. So we think that we are owed that.\nPresident Buhari has also taken several steps to fight corruption and improve the Nigerian business climate. And most of all to me—and again—is ripping down those trade barriers. These measures will make it easier for Nigeria and the United States companies to invest. And we will be investing substantially in Nigeria if they can create that level playing field that we have to very much ask for and maybe demand.\nI especially want to thank President Buhari for Nigeria's partnership and leadership in the fight against terrorism. He's been a real leader. Nigeria was one of the first African nations to join the coalition to defeat ISIS, and Nigerian forces are currently leading regional efforts against ISIS in West Africa and doing very well, as we have.\nNigeria is also leading African nations in the fight against Boko Haram and—another ruthless jihadist terrorist group. You've been reading about them. They kidnap the young girls and young women, many of whom never are seen again. It's tough stuff. This summer, it was my honor to meet with two brave young women, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu, who were kidnapped by Boko Haram in April of 2014 at the secondary school in Nigeria. I was deeply moved by their inspiring stories of courage, resilience, and survival. They really were two amazing young women.\nI told Joy and Lydia, my administration is committed to combating both jihadist terrorism and the scourge of human trafficking and smuggling. In the world today, there is more human trafficking than there has ever been, if you can believe this. They use the internet better than almost anybody is able to use the internet. So think of it, in a modern world, in this world, there's more human trafficking and slavery than at any time in the history of this world. It's hard to believe.\nTo protect Americans from these menaces, I have called on Congress to close deadly immigration loopholes that are exploited by terrorists, traffickers, and criminals. Just look at our southern border and our weak and obsolete immigration laws. They are obsolete, and they are weak, and they are pathetic. And there's no country in the world that has laws like we do. They've got to change, and they've got to change now for the safety of our country.\nWe're also helping our Nigerian partners by facilitating intelligence cooperation and providing training and military equipment to Nigerian forces. For example, we recently sold Nigeria 12 U.S. A-29 Super Tucano aircraft—it's a great aircraft—in the first-ever [major; White House correction.] sale of American military equipment to Nigeria. These new aircraft will improve Nigeria's ability to target terrorists and protect civilians.\nFinally, we're deeply concerned by religious violence in Nigeria, including the burning of churches and the killing and persecution of Christians. It's a horrible story. We encourage Nigeria and the federal, state, and local leaders to do everything in their power to immediately secure the affected communities and to protect innocent civilians of all faiths, including Muslims and including Christians.\nWell, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.\nSteve Miller of the Washington Times, please. Washington Times. Thank you, Steve.\nI don't think it would, number one. And there is no reason to apologize. Our immigration laws in this country are a total disaster. They're laughed at all over the world—they're laughed at—for their stupidity. And we have to have strong immigration laws.\nSo I think if I apologize, it wouldn't make 10 cents worth of difference to them. There's nothing to apologize for. We have to have strong immigration laws to protect our country.\nCentral American Migrants Seeking Asylum in the U.S./Immigration Reform/Border Security\nWe've been watching it. We've been watching it, Steve.\nWell, I won't get into percentages. But we are a nation of laws. We have to have borders. We don't have borders, we don't have a country. And I've been watching for weeks as the caravan came up. And you know, the Mexican laws are very tough on immigration, extremely tough. And it started out with way over a thousand people—I guess now it's down to about a hundred—going all through Mexico. People don't realize what a big country Mexico is. But it came down by a lot.\nAnd now we're working on the border with the worst laws any country—no matter where you go, all over the world, they can't even believe it. And we're doing the best we can with it. But we have to have changes in Congress, and we have to have it quickly. We need a wall, number one. And you see that right now. You know, where they are—even though it's not a particularly good wall and even though a small percentage can climb to the top, they have to be in extremely good shape. But a small percentage can climb that particular wall. We have a wall that's much more difficult.\nBut if you didn't have that, you would have thousands of people just pouring into our country. You've got to have a wall. And we need border security, and we will have border security. As you know, we're sending many, many National Guardsmen down to the border—most of them are already there—and that's having a big impact. But we need a change in the law. Catch-and-release is ridiculous. If they touch our property, if they touch our country, essentially, you catch them, and you release them into our country. That's not acceptable to anybody. So we need a change in the law.\nWell, we more and more are—because it's a very fair question—we more and more are not wanting to be the policeman of the world. And we're spending tremendous amounts of money for decades on policing the world, and that shouldn't be our priority. We want to police ourselves, and we want to rebuild our country. And the President understands that. And they've come a long way. They're doing a great job. We're contributing to that job, but they have done a great job.\nWhat we do want to do, though, is open Nigeria and other countries up to trade, because we have spent, over the last decade, a number that's so large you wouldn't even believe it. And I think we'll be treated in a reciprocal fashion now, as of today. So I think that's going to happen.\nAnd I have great respect for the President. Okay?\nHow about Jordan Fabian? Where's Jordan? Jordan. The Hill.\nThank you.\nNo, I think it sends the right message. You know, in 7 years that deal will have expired and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons. That's not acceptable. Seven years is tomorrow. That's not acceptable.\nSo no, if anything, it's proven right what Israel has done today with the news conference. And Prime Minister Netanyahu just gave a very—I don't know if everybody has seen it, but I got to see a little bit of it. And that is just not an acceptable situation. And I've been saying that's happening. They're not sitting back idly. They're setting off missiles, which they say are for television purposes. I don't think so.\nSo we'll see what happens. I'm not telling you what I'm doing, but a lot of people think they know. And on or before the 12th, we'll make a decision. That doesn't mean we won't negotiate a real agreement. You know, this is an agreement that wasn't approved by too many people. And it's a horrible agreement for the United States, including the fact, Mr. President, that we gave Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion in cash—Nigeria would like some of that—$1.8 billion in cash and $150 billion. You know what we got? We got nothing. We got nothing.\nSo that doesn't mean I wouldn't negotiate a new agreement. We'll see what happens. But I think, if anything, what's happening today and what's happened over the last little while and what we've learned, has really shown that I've been 100 percent right.\nWe didn't discuss it. [Laughter] And you do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in. But we didn't discuss it, because the President knows me, and he knows where I'm coming from. And I appreciate that. We did not discuss it.\nWell, I would like to visit Nigeria. I'd like very much to visit Nigeria. It's an amazing country. And in certain ways, I hear from the standpoint of the beauty of a country, there's no country more beautiful. So I would like to. And the first part of your question, I couldn't hear what you were saying. Go ahead.\nOh, helicopters?\nOh, oh. We love helicopters. He likes them more than I do. He likes buying helicopters. But he is—and they're buying a lot of helicopters. Helicopters——\nVery soon.\nYes, very soon. We're getting it approved. Part of the problem was that you weren't allowed to buy helicopters in our country, and now you are. I worked that out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want. They weren't allowed to buy the helicopters in our country for various reasons, which, frankly, were not good reasons. But now they get them, and they get them very quickly. And they are the best helicopters anywhere in the world. We make the best military equipment in the world. And our friends can now buy that equipment.\nDid you have a question for the President?\nThank you. [Laughter]\nYes. We have actually discussed all of those topics at length over the last period of time. And in terms of corruption, Nigeria has a reputation, as you understand very well, for very massive corruption. I also know that the President has been able to cut that down very substantially. We talked about it; he is working on it. And they have made a lot of progress, and I think they will continue to make a lot of progress.\nWe have a lot of people in this country and, frankly, the country itself, that invests in Nigeria. So cutting down on that corruption element and a corrupt element is very important to us. And the President will be able to do that.\nI think maybe more than anything else, what we discussed today was agricultural products going into Nigeria, which Nigeria wants. But we have certain barriers that don't allow that to happen. So for the good of our farmers—U.S. farmers—and for the good of Nigeria and all of Africa, it's very important that we are able to sell our great agricultural products into Nigeria. And that will happen, and we're going to be working on that right away. Okay?\nThank you all very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.\nIt's possible. It's very possible.\nWell, it was an interesting thought. And I had that thought. We're looking at various countries, including Singapore. And we are also talking about the possibility of the DMZ—Peace House/Freedom House.\nAnd there's something that I thought was intriguing. I think that some people maybe don't like the look of that, and some people like it very much. I threw it out today as an idea. I also told President Moon, and through President Moon, we connected with North Korea. There's something that I like about it, because you're there. You're actually there—where, if things work out, there's a great celebration to be had on the site, not in a third-party country.\nSo we are looking at the possibility of doing it in that location. We're also looking at various other countries, including Singapore. I will say this, the good news: Everybody wants us. It has the chance to be a big event.\nAnd the United States—I was talking to John Bolton about this a little while ago—the United States has never been closer to potentially having something happen with respect to the Korean Peninsula that can get rid of the nuclear weapons, can create so many good things, so many positive things, and peace and safety for the world.\nSo we'll see what happens. You know, I often say, \"Who knows?\" Who knows? Maybe a lot of things change. But Kim Jong Un, who has been very open and very straightforward so far—I can only say, again, \"so far.\" But he's talking about getting rid of the site, which was their big site. He's talking about no research, no launching of ballistic missiles, no nuclear testing. And he has lived up to that for a long period of time, a longer period of time than anybody has seen.\nSo we are looking at that as a potential site, yes. I think it would be very interesting. I think it would be a great celebration if it works out well. And if it doesn't work out well, that's the way it goes.\nOh, yes, I think the summit is going to happen. They very much want it. We certainly would like to see it. I think the summit will happen. And personally, I think it's going to be a success. But we'll see. I will say this: If it's not a success—if it's not a success——\nHe's got to get rid of the nuclear weapons. If it's not a success, I will respectfully leave. It's very simple.\nThank you all very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-muhammadu-buhari-nigeria"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan", "Date": "2018-06-07", "Text": "Thank you very much. Today I'm greatly honored to welcome my good friend, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, to the White House. Over the past 16 months, the Prime Minister and I have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many; seize opportunities; and advance the interests of our nations. Today we have had another deeply productive and very valuable discussion.\nWe have developed not only a strong working relationship over the last year and a half, specifically 503 days, but a great personal friendship. I was honored by the tremendous hospitality the Prime Minister showed me when the American delegation went to Japan last year. It was really something very special. And we had the Prime Minister and Mrs. Abe as our guests at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.\nThe steadfast alliance between Japan and the United States is an enduring force of peace and stability in the Pacific region and around the world. From the beginning of my administration, the Prime Minister and I have been working to expand our cooperation in a range of areas, including defense and commerce, which is what we discussed today.\nAs I prepare to meet next week with Kim Jong Un—and I want to bring up the fact that the Prime Minister Abe and, also, President Moon of South Korea were extremely helpful, cooperative, and they'd like to see something happen. It would be great for North Korea, South Korea. It would be great for Japan, the United States, and the world. Our partnership has been invaluable in reaching this important moment, and we will continue to be in very close communication in the weeks ahead, including the issue of Japanese abductees, which I know is of great personal importance to Prime Minister Abe.\nI hope the upcoming meeting in Singapore represents the beginning of a bright new future for North Korea and indeed a bright new future for the world. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would usher in a new era of prosperity, security, and peace for all Koreans—for North and South—and for people everywhere.\nPrime Minister Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the United States and Japan, something we have to do. The United States seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. We're working hard to reduce our trade imbalance, which is very substantial, remove barriers to U.S. exports, and to achieve a fair and mutually beneficial economic partnership. And we're on our way.\nThe Prime Minister was telling us just moments ago that they're buying billions and billions of dollars of additional products of all kinds: military jets, airliners from Boeing, lots of farm products. We're going to be doing a lot more business with Japan, which is what everybody wants to see.\nThere's never been a better time to invest in the United States. Thanks to our massive tax cuts, historic deregulation, a strong trade policy, which has just really begun—because I will tell you over the years it has been an extraordinarily weak trade policy—the opening of American energy, and a return to the rule of law, our economy is absolutely booming, best it's ever been. Unemployment is at the lowest level in nearly half a century. And for African American and Hispanic American workers, unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded.\nWe welcome and encourage Japanese investors to open new plants and factories in the United States. And that will happen. The Prime Minister has told me that will happen. We want new auto plants going into Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and many of our States that have them and some that don't. And they'll be doing that.\nJapan has also remained a critical partner in our efforts to promote a free and open Pacific region where sovereign nations uphold the rule of law, respect the rights of their neighbors, and honor the interests of their people. These core principles allow diverse nations to thrive and prosper altogether in one beautiful, peaceful atmosphere. We're all happy about it. It's what's happening now.\nPrime Minister Abe, it is a true privilege to work with you. You've become my great friend. I want to thank you for being here at the White House for our meetings today. So productive. I'm also very proud to say that the bonds between our nations are stronger than ever before. And I know that, together, we can unlock incredible new opportunities, achieve remarkable new prosperity, and ensure the safety and security of our citizens for a very, very long time to come. And that's what we intend to do.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.\nAppreciate it. That's very nice. So we'll take a few questions, if we can start.\nJohn Roberts [Fox News], go ahead.\nWell, the letter was just a greeting. It was really very nice. Perhaps I can get approval to put it out. It was really a very warm letter, a very nice letter. I appreciated it very much. And nothing other than: We look forward to seeing you, and we look forward to the summit, and hopefully, some wonderful things will work out. So it was really very warm, very nice. We appreciated it.\nI think, John, that we are going to—we're going to have a great success. I don't think it will be in one meeting. I think it will take longer than that. This has been going on for many, many decades. This is something that should have been solved by other Presidents, as I've said often before, long before this point. They waited till the last second. And they shouldn't have waited. This should have been solved by many others. I'm not just saying President Obama, I'm saying other Presidents. A long time ago, this could have been solved in a lot easier manner and a lot less dangerous manner. But it wasn't. So I'll solve it, and we'll get it done.\nAs far as the Prime Minister is concerned, we've—we will agree and we have agreed that we're going to be helping—if the deal is done, we're going to be helping North Korea. We're going to be working with China. We're going to be working with South Korea. President Xi of China has been terrific. The border has been certainly more closed than ever before. I'd like them to close it a little bit more, but it's been more closed than ever before. China has never worked with us this way. And you know, I give him a lot of credit because, as you know, we're in a dispute as to the imbalance of trade. It's a massive imbalance in China's favor. It's been that way for many decades, and it should have also been handled by previous Presidents. But it wasn't, so we'll handle that too.\nBut I give President Xi tremendous credit, and I give President Moon tremendous credit. He really would like to see something happen. They've been living with the threat of war from their beginning, and it doesn't make sense. And I really believe that Kim Jong Un wants to do something. I think he wants to see something incredible happen for the people of North Korea.\nSo we have a lot of great opportunities right now. Shouldn't have waited to this point, but we have a lot of great opportunity.\nJohn, please.\nWell, it could be. We could sign an agreement. As you know, that would be a first step. It's what happens after the agreement that really is the big point.\nBut, yes, we could absolutely sign an agreement. We're looking at it. We're talking about it with them. We're talking about it with a lot of other people. But that could happen. But that's really the beginning. Sounds a little bit strange, but that's probably the easy part; the hard part remains after that.\nNormalizing relations is something that I would expect to do, I would hope to do, when everything is complete. We would certainly hope to do that.\nI know that Prime Minister Abe and President Moon have told me, very strongly, that they are going to go and they will help them economically, tremendously. Japan has a tremendous stake, and so do they. We, on the other hand, are very far away. We're very, very far away.\nBut Japan will be helping. I believe China will be helping economically, also. And I think China wants to see something very good happen, very positive happen. And certainly, South Korea has already stated their intentions. They will be very helpful.\nSo there are lot of good factors lined up for North Korea. A lot of tremendous factors that give it tremendous potential. It has tremendous potential because the people are great. And we would certainly like to see normalization, yes.\nYes. Thank you very much. Maximum pressure is absolutely in effect. We don't use the term anymore because we're going into a friendly negotiation. Perhaps after that negotiation, I will be using it again. You'll know how well we do in the negotiation. If you hear me saying we're going to use \"maximum pressure,\" you'll know the negotiation did not do well, frankly. We—there's no reason to say it.\nWe, in the meantime, haven't removed any sanctions. We have a list of over 300 massive, in some cases, sanctions to put on North Korea. And I've decided to hold that until we can make a deal, because I really believe there's a potential to make a deal. And I just don't think it's nice going in under those circumstances. But, yes, the campaign hasn't changed. China has continued to hold the border. We, again, would like them to do more in that sense. But they've been really good, and the President has been very good. But maximum sanction is there. We are leaving all of the existing sanctions on. We have many, many sanctions to go, but I don't want to use them unless it's necessary. And I don't think it will be necessary, but we will soon know. Okay? Thank you.\nWell, the answer is yes to the second part of your question. But certainly, if it goes well. And I think it would be well received. I think he would look at it very favorably. So I think that could happen.\nAll I can say is, I am totally prepared to walk away. I did it once before. You have to be able to walk away. If you're not going to be able to walk away—we didn't walk away from the horrible Iran deal that was signed. And if you look at what's happened since I signed that deal, Iran—and in all fairness, I say it with great respect for the people of Iran—but Iran is acting a lot differently. They're no longer looking so much to the Mediterranean. They're no longer looking so much to what's going on in Syria, what's going on in Yemen and lots of other places. They're a much different country over the last 3 months.\nAnd again, I say that with hope that maybe something can happen. But when you mention sanctions, we're putting sanctions on Iran, the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, including, frankly, North Korea. That would have been the next phase, if we did it or find it necessary to do.\nBut nuclear to me is always first. And we're going to be fine, with respect to Iran. But we also, Saagar, got something out of it that's very important. A lot of the people that write about this, some of whom I have great respect for, but they haven't picked it up: Iran is not the same country that it was a few months ago. They're a much, much different group of leaders. And I hope at some point they'll come to us and we'll sit down and we'll make a deal that's good for them and good for us and good for everybody. And it will be great for Iran. I expect it to be—I want it to be—great for Iran.\nBut if they would have walked—our side—from some of the horrible provisions that you know as well as I do, and probably everybody sitting here knows, we could have had a great deal. Nothing wrong with a deal, but there's something wrong with that deal. We had a great opportunity to make a phenomenal deal.\nSo I am totally prepared to walk. It could happen. Maybe it won't be necessary. I hope it won't be necessary to walk because I really believe that Kim Jong Un wants to do something that is going to be great for his people and also great for his family and great for himself.\nOkay? Thank you very much.\nChairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North KoreaQ.Sir, if you do invite him to the White House—or to the United States, would it be here at the White House or at Mar-a-Lago?\nMaybe we'll start with the White House. What do you think? [Laughter]\nYou know, I can speak first because I will tell you, on the Prime Minister's behalf, that he very much talked about abduction. It was preeminent in our conversations. He talked about it long and hard and passionately. And I will follow his wishes, and we will be discussing that with North Korea, absolutely. Absolutely.\nPrime Minister, go ahead.\nI'd like to just close by paying my highest respect and regards and love, frankly—I've gotten to know them very well—to the Warmbier family, the incredible family of Otto Warmbier, who was a brilliant, beautiful, terrific young man. And he has not died in vain, I can tell you that. He has not died in vain. So to the Warmbier family, our love and our respect.\nAlso, I'd like to say that we were tremendously successful in getting our three hostages back. And I'm very thankful to the cooperation that we received from North Korea. And the three United States citizens are now very happily ensconced in their homes with their families. They're very happy. And they didn't think this was going to happen. And frankly, it would never have happened, but it has.\nSo I just want to wish them well also. They had a tough journey, but I really respect the fact that we were able to work with the North Korean folks and get them out. They're very, very well ingrained already. They're back into—they were telling me they're now going to movies and they're going out to dinner and they're back. They're back in our country, and it's a terrific thing.\nI believe we're going to have a terrific success or a modified success. But in one form or another, if it all goes—and things can happen between now and then—but I know many of you are going. And I look forward to seeing you there. I look forward to traveling with you. It's a long way. But I really believe that we have the potential to do something incredible for the world. And it's my honor to be involved.\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shinzo-abe-japan-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Charlevoix, Canada", "Date": "2018-06-09", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. We're getting ready to make a big trip. We're just leaving, but we wanted to have a little bit of a conference just to announce what's happened, how we've done. And I think it's been very, very successful. We've concluded a really tremendously successful G-7 and would like to provide you with an update.\nAnd you know the gentlemen up are the legendary Larry Kudlow and the legendary John Bolton. We had a good meeting, both on defense and environment and, frankly, on tariffs, which are what we're here for.\nFirst, I'd like to thank Prime Minister Trudeau for hosting this summit. It has worked out to be so wonderful. The people of Canada are wonderful, and it's a great country and a very beautiful country, I might add.\nWe tackled a variety of issues and opportunities facing our nations. At the top of the list was the issue of trade—a very important subject—because the United States has been taken advantage of for decades and decades, and we can't do that anymore. We had extremely productive discussions on the need to have fair and reciprocal, meaning, the same. People can't charge us 270 percent, and we charge them nothing. That doesn't work anymore.\nI made a lot of statements having to do with clarity. We want and expect other nations to provide fair market access to American exports, and that we will take whatever steps are necessary to protect American industry and workers from unfair foreign trading practices, of which, really, there are many. But we're getting them straightened out, slowly but surely.\nWe also discussed the issue of uncontrolled migration and the threat that it poses to both national security and other groups and countries and our citizens and quality of life. We're committed to addressing the migration challenge by helping migrants to remain and prosper in their own home countries. A wide array of national security threats were addressed, including the threat of Iran. The G-7 nations remain committed to controlling Iran's nuclear ambitions—with or without them, those ambitions are going to be controlled—along with efforts to combat terrorism and extremism and those who spread this deadly ideology.\nThe nations of the G-7 are bound together by shared values and beliefs. That came out loud and clear. Each of our nations is totally unique, with our own people and our own sovereign obligations, but we can coordinate together and achieve a common good—a good for all—good for all of our people, all of our nations.\nWe're linked in the great effort to create a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world. And from the standpoint of trade and jobs and being fair to companies, we are really, I think, committed. I think they are starting to be committed to a much more fair trade situation for the United States, because it has been treated very, very unfairly.\nAnd I don't blame other leaders for that. I blame our past leaders. There was no reason that this should have happened. Last year, they lost eight-hundred—we as a nation, over the years—but the latest number is $817 billion on trade. That's ridiculous, and it's unacceptable. And everybody was told that. So I don't blame them; I blame our leaders. In fact, I congratulate the leaders of other countries for so crazily being able to make these trade deals that were so good for their country and so bad for the United States. But those days are over.\nIn just a few minutes, I'll be leaving for Singapore. I'll be on a mission of peace, and we will carry in, really—in my heart, we're going to be carrying the hearts of millions of people, people from all over the world. We have to get denuclearization. We have to get something going. We really think that North Korea will be a tremendous place in a very short period of time. And we appreciate everything that's going on. And we appreciate the working together with North Korea. They're really working very well with us.\nSo I say, so far, so good. We're going to have to see what happens. And we're going to know very soon. So I'll be leaving—as soon as we're finished with this conference, I'll be leaving. And I very much look forward to it. I think it's very important for North Korea and South Korea and Japan and the world and the United States. It's a great thing. And we'll see what happens.\nWell, there's always everything. It's really—you know, this has probably rarely been done. It's unknown territory, in the truest sense. But I really feel confident. I feel that Kim Jong Un wants to do something great for his people, and he has that opportunity. And he won't have that opportunity again. It's never going to be there again.\nSo I really believe that he's going to do something very positive for his people, for himself, his family. He's got an opportunity, the likes of which I think almost—if you look into history—very few people have ever had. He can take that nation, with those great people, and truly make it great. So it's a one-time—it's a one-time shot. And I think it's going to work out very well.\nThat's why I feel positive, because it makes so much sense. And we will watch over, and we'll protect, and we'll do a lot of things. I can say that South Korea, Japan, China, many countries want to see it happen. And they'll help. They'll all help. So there's a great—there's really—this is a great time. This has not happened in all of the years that they've been separated by a very artificial boundary. This is a great opportunity for peace and lasting peace and prosperity.\nYes, ma'am.\nYes, I have not spoken to Vladimir Putin in quite a while. It has been discussed. We didn't do votes or anything, but it has been discussed. Some people like the idea of bringing Russia back in. This used to be the G-8, not the G-7. And something happened a while ago, where Russia is no longer in. I think it would be an asset to have Russia back in. I think it would be good for the world. I think it would be good for Russia. I think it would be good for the United States. I think it would be good for all of the countries of the current G-7.\nI think the G-8 would be better. I think having Russia back in would be a positive thing. We're looking for peace in the world. We're not looking to play games.\nI did. Oh, I did. That's the way it should be. No tariffs, no barriers. That would—that's the way it should be.\nAnd no subsidies. I even said no tariffs. In other words, let's say Canada—where we have tremendous tariffs—the United States pays tremendous tariffs on dairy. As an example, 270 percent. Nobody knows that. We pay nothing. We don't want to pay anything. Why should we pay?\nWe have to—ultimately, that's what you want. You want a tariff-free, you want no barriers, and you want no subsidies, because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries, and that's not fair. So you go tariff-free, you go barrier-free, you go subsidy-free. That's the way you learned at the Wharton School of Finance. I mean, that would be the ultimate thing. Now, whether or not that works—but I did suggest it, and people were—I guess, they're going to go back to the drawing and check it out, right?\nBut we can't have—an example—where we're paying—the United States is paying 270 percent. Just can't have it. And when they send things into us, you don't have that. I will say, it was not contentious. What was strong was the language that this cannot go on. But the relationships are very good, whether it be President Macron or with Justin. We had—Justin did a really good job. I think the relationships were outstanding.\nBut because of the fact that the United States leaders of the past didn't do a good job on trade—and again, I'm not blaming countries, I'm blaming our people that represented our past. It's got to change. It's going to change. I mean, it's not a question of \"I hope it changes.\" It's going to change, a hundred percent. And tariffs are going to come way down, because we—people cannot continue to do that. We're like the piggybank that everybody is robbing. And that ends.\nIn fact, Larry Kudlow is a great expert on this, and he's a total free trader. But even Larry has seen the ravages of what they've done with their tariffs. Would you like to say something on that, Larry, very quickly? It might be interesting.\nThank you.\nAnd it's very unfair to our farmers. Our farmers are, essentially—whether it's through a barrier, nonmonetary barrier, or whether it's through very high tariffs that make it impossible—and this is all over the world. This isn't just G-7. I mean, we have India, where some of the tariffs are a hundred percent. A hundred percent. And we charge nothing. We can't do that. And so we are talking to many countries. We're talking to all countries. And it's going to stop. Or we'll stop trading with them. And that's a very profitable answer, if we have to do it.\nYes, sir.\nWell, if they retaliate, they're making a mistake. Because, you see, we have a tremendous trade imbalance. So when we try and bring our piece up a little bit so that it's not so bad, and then they go up—right?—the difference is they do so much more business with us than we do with them that we can't lose that. You understand. We can't lose it.\nAnd as an example, with one country we have $375 billion in trade deficits. We can't lose. You could make the case that they lost years ago. But when you're down $375 billion, you can't lose. And we have to bring them up.\nSo there's very bad spirit. When we have a big trade imbalance and we want to bring it up to balance—just balance—and they keep raising it so that you never catch, that's not a good thing to do. And we have very, very strong measures that take care of that, because we do so much—the numbers are so astronomically against them in terms of anything, as per your question. We win that war a thousand times out of a thousand.\nSo two things can happen on NAFTA. We'll either leave it the way it is, as a threesome deal with Canada and with the United States and Mexico and change it very substantially—we're talking about very big changes. Or we're going to make a deal directly with Canada, directly with Mexico. Both of those things could happen. If a deal isn't made, that would be a very bad thing for Canada, and it would be a very bad thing for Mexico. For the United States, frankly, it would be a good thing. But I'm not looking to do that. I'm not looking to play that game.\nSo we're either going to have NAFTA in a better negotiated form, or we're going to have two deals.\nIt will have a sunset. You have the two sunsets. I mean, you have an ISDS provision and a sunset provision. They've been very heavily negotiated. You have two sunsets, two concepts of sunset. We're pretty close on the sunset division. Okay?\nWell, we have one that's 5 years; you know it very well. You've studied this very well. Congratulations. That's right. You have one group that likes to have 5 years, and then a renegotiation at the end of 5 years. And you have another group that wants longer because of the investments. So—but we're pretty close.\nYes, sir.\nWell, you know, you have to ask President Obama, because he was the one that let Crimea get away. That was during his administration. And he was the one that let Russia go and spend a lot of money on Crimea, because they've spent a lot of money on rebuilding it. I guess they have their submarine port there and such. But Crimea was let go during the Obama administration. And you know, Obama can say all he wants, but he allowed Russia to take Crimea. I may have had a much different attitude. But—so you'd really have to ask that question to President Obama—you know, why did he do that; why did he do that? But with that being said, it's been done a long time.\nI would rather see Russia in the G-8 as opposed to the G-7. I would say that the G-8 is a more meaningful group than the G-7, absolutely.\nThey virtually didn't even make that case. I mean, my case is the fact that it is national security; it's our balance sheet; it's our strength. It's absolutely national security. And, you know, if you look at our—just take a look at our balance sheet. We're going to have a very strong balance sheet very soon because of what I'm doing. We have the strongest economy that we've ever had in the United States—in the history of the United States. We have the best unemployment numbers: Black unemployment, the lowest in history; Hispanic unemployment, the lowest in history. I don't mean the lowest in the last 10 years or 20 years. The lowest in the history of this country. Black unemployment is doing the best it's ever done. Hispanic doing the best. Women are now up to 21 years. Soon it's going to be the best ever in its history—in the country's history.\nWe have to have deals that are fair, and we have to have deals that are economic. Otherwise, that does, in fact, affect our military. Okay?\nOh, it's very easy. It's economic. It's the balance sheet. To have a great military, you need a great balance sheet. Okay?\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\nGroup of Seven (G-7) Nations/News Media/U.S. Relations With Allies/Trade\nIt's well put, I think.\nWho are you with, out of curiosity?\nI figured. Fake News CNN, the worst. But no, I could tell by the question. I had no idea you were CNN. After the question, I was just curious as to who you were with. You're with CNN.\nI would say that the level of relationship is a 10. We have a great relationship. Angela and Emmanuel and Justin. I would say the relationship is a 10. And I don't blame them. I blame—as I said, I blame our past leaders for allowing this to happen. There was no reason this should happen. There's no reason that we should have big trade deficits with virtually every country in the world. I'm going long beyond the G-7. There's no reason for this. It's the fault of the people that preceded me. And I'm not just saying President Obama. I'm going back a long way. You can go back 50 years, frankly. It just got worse and worse and worse.\nYou know, we used to be a nation that was unbelievably cashflow oriented, had no debt of any consequence, and that built the highway system. We built the interstate system out of—virtually out of cashflow. And it was a lot different.\nNo, we have a very good relationship, and I don't blame these people, but I will blame them if they don't act smart and do what they have to do—because they have no choice. I'll be honest with you, they have no choice.\nThey're either going to make the trades fair, because our farmers have been hurt. You look at our farmers. For 15 years, the graph is going just like this, down. Our farmers have been hurt, our workers have been hurt. Our companies have moved out and moved to Mexico and other countries, including Canada.\nNow, we are going to fix that situation. And if it's not fixed, we're not going to deal with these countries. But the relationship that I've had is great. So you can tell that to your fake friends at CNN.\nThe relationship that I've had with the people, the leaders of these countries, has been—I would really, rate it—on a scale of 0 to 10, I would rate it a 10. That doesn't mean I agree with what they're doing. And they know very well that I don't. So we're negotiating very hard, tariffs and barriers.\nAs an example, the European Union is brutal to the United States. They don't take—and they understand that. They know it. When I'm telling them, they're smiling at me. You know, it's like they—the gig is up. It's like the gig is up. They're not trying to—there's nothing they can say. They can't believe they got away with it. Canada can't believe it got away with it. Mexico—we have $100 billion trade deficit with Mexico, and that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring in because we have no wall. But we are. We started building the wall, as you know. $1.6 billion—and we're going to keep that going.\nBut a lot of these countries actually smile at me when I'm talking. And the smile is—we couldn't believe we got away with it. That's the smile. So it's going to change. It's going to change. They have no choice. If it's not going to change, we're not going to trade with them.\nOkay, how about a couple of more? Go ahead in the back.\nYes. Hi.\nI have a clear objective. But I have to say, Eliana, that it's going to be something that will always be spur of the moment. You don't know. You know, this has not been done before at this level. This is a leader who really is an unknown personality. People don't know much about him. I think that he's going to surprise on the upside, very much on the upside. We'll see. But never been done. Never been tested. Many people—world leaders—I'm talking about world leaders that have been right next to him have never met him.\nSo we're going in with a very positive spirit, I think, very well prepared. I think—and by the way, we have worked very well with their people. They have many people right now in Shanghai; our people have been—in Singapore. Our people have been working very, very well with the representatives of North Korea.\nSo we're going in with a very positive attitude, and I think we're going to come out fine. But I've said it many times: Who knows? Who knows? May not. May not work out. It's a good chance it won't work out. There's probably an even better chance that it will take a period of time. It will be a process.\nThat's a good question. How long will it take? I think within the first minute I'll know.\nJust my touch, my feel. That's what I do. How long will it take to figure out whether or not they're serious? I said maybe in the first minute. You know, the way—they say that you know if you're going to like somebody in the first 5 seconds. You ever hear that one? Well, I think that very quickly I'll know whether or not something good is going to happen.\nI also think I'll know whether or not it will happen fast. It may not. But I think I'll know pretty quickly whether or not, in my opinion, something positive will happen.\nAnd if I think it won't happen, I'm not going to waste my time. I don't want to waste his time.\nYes, ma'am.\nNo, no, no, no. That's only—only the fake news says that. You know, this—look, we just three hostages back. We paid nothing. They came back. They're happily in ensconced in their homes with their families. They're the happiest people in the world right now.\nWe have gotten—you know, we haven't done anything. Everyone said—you know, the haters, they say, \"Oh, you're giving him a meeting, you're\"—give me a break, okay? There's nothing. I think if I didn't do this, it would be—and it's never been done before, you know. It's never been done before. And obviously, what has been done before hasn't worked.\nAnd this is something—I can't stress this strong enough. You know, I talked about tariffs that previous people—and I'm not looking to criticize people that were preceding me—but on tariffs, it should have never happened.\nWell, the same thing on North Korea. We shouldn't be in this position. We shouldn't be in this position on tariffs, where we're hundreds of billions of dollars down to other countries that, frankly, were never even negotiated with. They never even got spoken to. I asked a top person in China, how did it get so bad? He looked at me, he said, \"Nobody ever talked to us.\" They were missing in action, our leaders.\nWell, a very similar thing, if you think about it, took place with North Korea. This should not be done now. This should have been done 5 years ago and 10 years ago and 25 years ago. It shouldn't be done now.\nI can't comment on that.\nDirector KudlowSir, you've got a plane to catch, Mr. President.\nOkay, one more question.\nWe're going to raise every issue.\nEvery issue is going to be raised.\nBecause the U.S. press is very dishonest, much of it. Not all of it. Oh, I have some folks in your profession that are with the U.S., in the U.S.—citizens, proud citizens; they're reporters. These are some of the most outstanding people I know. But there are many people in the press that are unbelievably dishonest. They don't cover stories the way they're supposed to be. They don't even report them, in many cases, if they're positive.\nSo there's tremendous—you know, I came up with the term, \"fake news.\" It's a lot of fake news. But at the same time, I have great respect for many people in the press.\nThank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-charlevoix-canada"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference on Sentosa Island, Singapore", "Date": "2018-06-12", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. We're getting ready to go back. We had a tremendous 24 hours. We've had a tremendous 3 months, actually, because this has been going on for quite a while. That was a tape that we gave to Chairman Kim and his people, his representatives. And it captures a lot. It captures what could be done. And that's a great place. It has the potential to be an incredible place. Between South Korea—if you think about it—and China, it's got tremendous potential. And I think he understands that, and he wants to do what's right.\nIt's my honor today to address the people of the world, following this very historic summit with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea. We spent very intensive hours together, and I think most of you have gotten the signed document, or you will very shortly. It's very comprehensive. It's going to happen.\nI stand before you as an emissary of the American people to deliver a message of hope and vision, and a message of peace.\nLet me begin by thanking our incredible hosts in Singapore, especially Prime Minister Lee, a friend of mine. This is a country of profound grace and beauty, and we send our warmest wishes to every citizen of Singapore, who really made this visit so important and so pleasant, despite all of the work and all of the long hours.\nI also want to thank President Moon of South Korea. He's working hard. In fact, I'll be speaking to him right after we're finished. Prime Minister Abe of Japan—friend of mine—just left our country, and he wants what's right for Japan and for the world. He's a good man. And a very special person, President Xi of China, who has really closed up that border—maybe a little bit less so over the last couple of months, but that's okay. But he really has. And he's a terrific person and a friend of mine and really a great leader of his people. I want to thank them for their efforts to help us get to this very historic day.\nMost importantly, I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people. Our unprecedented meeting—the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea—proves that real change is indeed possible. My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct, and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time, under very strong, strong circumstance. We're prepared to start a new history, and we're ready to write a new chapter between our nations.\nNearly 70 years ago—think of that; 70 years ago—an extremely bloody conflict ravaged the Korean Peninsula. Countless people died in the conflict, including tens of thousands of brave Americans. Yet, while the armistice was agreed to, the war never ended, to this day, never ended. But now we can all have hope that it will soon end. And it will. It will soon end.\nThe past does not have to define the future. Yesterday's conflict does not have to be tomorrow's war. And as history has proven over and over again, adversaries can indeed become friends. We can honor the sacrifice of our forefathers by replacing the horrors of battle with the blessings of peace. And that's what we're doing, and that's what we have done.\nThere is no limit to what North Korea can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce and engagement with the rest of the world that really wants to engage. Chairman Kim has before him an opportunity like no other: to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security and prosperity for his people.\nChairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his \"unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" We also agreed to vigorous negotiations to implement the agreement as soon as possible. And he wants to do that. This isn't the past. This isn't another administration that never got it started and therefore never got it done.\nChairman Kim has told me that North Korea is already destroying a major missile engine testing site. That's not in your signed document; we agreed to that after the agreement was signed. That's a big thing—for the missiles that they were testing, the site is going to be destroyed very soon.\nToday is the beginning of an arduous process. Our eyes are wide open, but peace is always worth the effort, especially in this case. This should have been done years ago. This should have been resolved a long time ago, but we're resolving it now.\nChairman Kim has the chance to seize an incredible future for his people. Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace. The current state of affairs cannot endure forever. The people of Korea—North and South—are profoundly talented, industrious, and gifted. These are truly gifted people. They share the same heritage, language, customs, culture, and destiny. But to realize their amazing destiny, to reunite their national family, the menace of nuclear weapons will now be removed.\nIn the meantime, the sanctions will remain in effect. We dream of a future where all Koreans can live together in harmony, where families are reunited and hopes are reborn, and where the light of peace chases away the darkness of war. This bright future is within—and this is what's happening. It is right there. It's within our reach. It's going to be there. It's going to happen. People thought this could never take place. It is now taking place. It's a very great day. It's a very great moment in the history of the world.\nAnd Chairman Kim is on his way back to North Korea. And I know for a fact, as soon as he arrives, he's going to start a process that's going to make a lot of people very happy and very safe.\nSo it's an honor to be with everybody today. The media—this is a big gathering of media, I will say. It makes me feel very uncomfortable. [Laughter] But it is what it is. People understand that this is something very important to all of us, including yourselves and your families.\nSo thank you very much for being here. We'll take some questions. Wow. That's a lot of questions. Go ahead. Sure, go ahead. NBC.\nChairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea/Death of U.S. Citizen Otto Warmbier Following Release From Captivity in North Korea\nWell, he is very talented. Anybody that takes over a situation like he did, at 26 years of age, and is able to run it and run it tough—I don't say he was nice or I don't say anything about it—he ran it. Very few people, at that age—you can take 1 out of 10,000, probably, couldn't do it.\nOtto Warmbier is a very special person, and he will be for a long time, in my life. His parents are good friends of mine. I think without Otto this would not have happened. Something happened, from that day. It was a terrible thing. It was brutal. But a lot of people started to focus on what was going on, including North Korea.\nI really think that Otto is someone who did not die in vain. I told this to his parents. Special young man. And I have to say, special parents, special people. Otto did not die in vain. He had a lot to do with us being here today. Okay? Thank you very much.\nGo ahead.\nNo.\nNo, we're not reducing anything. We're not reducing. At some point, I have to be honest—and I used to say this during my campaign, as you know, probably, better than most—I want to get our soldiers out. I want to bring our soldiers back home. We have, right now, 32,000 soldiers in South Korea, and I'd like to be able to bring them back home. But that's not part of the equation right now. At some point, I hope it will be, but not right now.\nWe will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should. But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, I think it's very provocative.\nYes, John. Yes, John, go ahead. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry, I thought you were John Roberts [Fox News]. I looked at you, you just like——\nMuch better, right?\nYes.\nYes.Q.Was that a concession on the part of the United States?\nNo, not at all. Because if you look at it, I mean, it said we are going to—let's see here—it will be gone. We—I don't think you can be anymore plain than what we're asking—\"issues related to the establishment of the new U.S.-D.P.R.K relations\"—the building. We talk about the guarantees, and we talk about \"unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" This is the document that we just signed.\nYes, we do. Yes, we did. And we'll be verifying.\nYes, we'll be verifying. It will be verified.\nWell, it's going to be achieved by having a lot of people there, and as we develop a certain trust. And we think we have done that. Secretary Pompeo has been really doing a fantastic job—his staff, everybody. As we do that, we're going to have a lot of people there, and we're going to be working with them on a lot of other things. But this is complete denuclearization of North Korea, and it will be verified.\nCombinations of both. Combinations of both. And we have talked about it, yes.\nYes, go ahead. Be nice. Be respectful.\nYes, I mean, very fair question. He actually mentioned the fact that they proceeded down a path in the past, and ultimately, as you know, nothing got done. In one case, they took billions of dollars—during the Clinton regime—took billions of dollars and nothing happened. That was a terrible thing, and he actually brought it up to me.\nAnd he said we have never gone this far. I don't think they've ever had the confidence, frankly, in a President that they have right now for getting things done and having the ability to get things done. And he was very firm in the fact that he wants to do this. I think he might want to do this as much or even more than me, because they see a very bright future for North Korea.\nSo you never know. Right? We never know. But I'll tell you what, we signed a very comprehensive document today, and I think most of you have been given that document. But we signed a very, very comprehensive document, and I believe he's going to live up to that document. In fact, when he lands—which is going to be shortly—I think that he will start that process right away.Chairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea/President Trump's National Security Team\nI do. I do. I can only say that I know him for—really well, it's been very rhetorical, as you know. I think, without the rhetoric, it wouldn't have happened. I think without other things going along—I think the establishment of a new team was very important. We have a great team. But I do, I think he wants to get it done. I really feel that very strongly.\nOh, there's John. I think—you know, you two guys look alike when the light is right on the—the hair is very similar. Let me see, who has better hair? He's got pretty good hair, John, I hate to——\nHuman Rights in North Korea/Remains of U.S. Servicemembers Killed in Korean War\nYes.\nYes, it was discussed. It will be discussed more in the future, human rights. What was also discussed in great detail, John, was that fact that, you know, we have—and I must have had just countless calls and letters and tweets, anything you can do—they want the remains of their sons back. They want the remains of their fathers and mothers and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea. And I asked for it today, and we got it. That was a very last minute. The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.\nBut so many people, even during the campaign, they'd say, \"Is there any way you can work with North Korea to get the remains of my son back or my father back?\" So many people asked me this question. And you know, I said, \"Look, we don't get along too well with that particular group of people.\" But now we do. And he agreed to that so quickly and so nice—it was really a very nice thing, and he understands it. He understands it.\nSo for the thousands and thousands—I guess way over 6,000 that we know of, in terms of the remains, they'll be brought back.\nHuman Rights in North Korea/North Korea-U.S. Relations\nRight. It was discussed. It was discussed relatively briefly compared to denuclearization. Well, obviously, that's where we started and where we ended. But they will be doing things, and I think he wants to do things. I think he wants to—you'd be very surprised. Very smart. Very good negotiator. Wants to do the right thing. You know, he brought up the fact that, in the past, they took dialogue far—they never went—they never were like we are. There's never been anything like what's taken place now. But they went down the line. Billions of dollars was given—were given, and you know, the following day the nuclear program continued. But this is a much different time, and this is a much different President, in all fairness. This is very important to me. This was one of the—perhaps, one of the reasons that I won; I campaigned on this issue, as you know very well, John.\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\nWell, at a certain time, I will. I said that will be a day that I look very much forward to, at the appropriate time. And I also will be inviting Chairman Kim, at the appropriate time, to the White House. I would—I think it's really going to be something that will be very important. And he has accepted. I said, at the appropriate time. We want to go a little bit further down the road.\nBut what we signed today was a lot of things included. And then, you have things that weren't included that we got after the deal was signed. I've done that before in my life. But we didn't put it in the agreement because we didn't have time. And I think most of you have been handed out the agreement or soon will. But I——\nOh, you have not? Okay. Well, if you could have those agreements passed out. We just finished them, just a little while ago. But if you could have the agreements passed out, we'll—you'll see what we're talking about.\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\nThank you.\nYes.\nYes.\nThat's true. Fifty-thousand great troops. That's true. Yes, it did—abduction. Absolutely. This is Prime Minister Abe's—one of his, certainly—other than the whole denuking subject—certainly his, I would say, his main point. And I brought it up. Absolutely. And they're going to be working on that. It will be—we didn't put it down in the document, but it will be worked on.\nChristians, yes. We are—brought it up very strongly. You know, Franklin Graham spent—spent and spends—a tremendous amount of time in North Korea. He's got it very close to his heart. It did come up, and things will be happening. Okay? Thank you. Great question.\nYes, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Go ahead.\nThank you, Jon.\nRight. Jon, I believe it's a rough situation over there. There's no question about it. And we did discuss it today pretty strongly. I mean, knowing what the main purpose of what we were doing is: denuking. But discussed it at pretty good length. We'll be doing something on it. It's rough. It's rough in a lot of places, by the way. Not just there. But it's rough, and we will continue that. And I think, ultimately, we'll agree to something. But it was discussed at length outside of the nuclear situation, one of the primary topics.\nI think it will change. Yes. I think it probably has to, but I think it will. Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nSteve [Steve Holland, Reuters]. That's you, Steve? Right there.\nWell, you know, scientifically, I've been watching and reading a lot about this, and it does take a long time to pull off complete denuclearization. It takes a long time. Scientifically, you have to wait certain periods of time, and a lot of things happen. But despite that, once you start the process, it means it's pretty much over; you can't use them. That's the good news. And that's going to start very, very soon. I believe that's going to start very soon. We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done, Steve.\nThe sanctions will come off when we are sure that the nukes are no longer a factor. Sanctions played a big role, but they'll come off at that point. I hope it's going to be soon, but they'll come off. They—as you know, and as I've said, the sanctions right now remain. But at a certain point, I actually look forward to taking them off. And they'll come off when we know we're down the road—where it's not going to happen, nothing is going to happen. Okay?\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nThank you.\nThank you very much. Congratulations to everybody, by the way. Congratulations to everybody.\nGo ahead.\nWell, you have a different administration. You have a different President. You have a different Secretary of State. You have people that are—you know, it's very important to them. And we get it done. The other groups, maybe it wasn't a priority. I don't think they could have done it if it was a priority, frankly. I don't think they honestly could have done it even if it was a priority.\nAnd it would have been easier back then. It would have been—for me, it would have been much easier if this were 10 years ago or 5 years ago. And I'm not just blaming President Obama. I mean, this goes back—for 25 years, this should have happened. I was given a very tough hand. I was given this, I was given the Iran deal and plenty of other problems.\nBut we are—we're doing really well. And the Iran deal, I have to be honest, we—I did it because nuclear is always number one to me. Nuclear is number one. But on the Iran deal, I think Iran is a different country now than it was 3 or 4 months ago. I don't think they're looking so much to the Mediterranean. I don't think they're looking so much at Syria, like they were, with total confidence. I don't think they're so confident right now.\nBut I hope—with that being said, I hope that, at the appropriate time, after these sanctions kick in—and they are brutal, what we've put on Iran—I hope that they're going to come back and negotiate a real deal, because I'd love to be able to do that. But right now it's too soon for that.\nYes, please.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Diplomatic Relations\nYes.\nYes.\nYes, we've done exercises for a long period of time, working with South Korea. And we call them war games, and I call them war games. And they're tremendously expensive. The amount of money that we spend on that is incredible. And South Korea contributes, but not a hundred percent, which is certainly a subject that we have to talk to them about also. And that has to do with the military expense and also the trade.\nSo we're doing that. We actually have a new deal with South Korea, in terms of the trade deal, but we have to talk to them. We have to talk to many countries about treating us fairly.\nBut the war games are very expensive. We pay for a big majority of them. We fly in bombers from Guam. I said it—when I first started, I said, \"Where do the bombers come from?\" \"Guam. Nearby.\" I said: \"Oh, great, nearby. Where's nearby?\" \"Six and a half hours.\" Six and a half hours, that's a long time for these big massive planes to be flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam. I know a lot about airplanes; it's very expensive. And I didn't like it.\nAnd what I did say is—and I think it's very provocative, I have to tell you, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], it's a very provocative situation when I see that, and you have a country right next door. So under the circumstances that we are negotiating a very comprehensive, complete deal, I think it's inappropriate to be having war games. So number one, we save money—a lot. And number two, it really is something that I think they very much appreciated.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations/North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program\nWell, we've gotten—you know, I've heard that. I mean, some of the people that—I don't know, maybe they really mean it. I don't always want to go against the press, because I just don't—especially not today, this is too important. But I noticed that some of the people were saying that the President has agreed to meet, he has given up so much. I gave up nothing. I'm here. I haven't slept in 25 hours, but I thought it was appropriate to do—because we have been negotiating for literally around the clock with them and with us and with John and with Mike and a whole team of very talented people.\nBut we haven't given up anything, other than—you're right, I agreed to meet. And I think the meeting was every bit as good for the United States as it was for North Korea. But I just wrote down some of the things we got. And they—you know, they—sure, they got a meeting. But only a person that dislikes Donald Trump would say that I've agreed to make a big commitment. Sure, I've agreed to take a period of time and come here and meet, and that's good. But I think it's great for us and—as a country, and I think it's good for them. But what did they do to justify this meeting? Secured commitment for complete denuclearization; that's the big thing. They secured the release of three American hostages. They already gave them to us 2 months ago. These people are now living happily back in their homes with their families. And it was pretty rough for them, to put it mildly.\nSecure the commitment to recover the remains, including—these are of fallen heroes. And they're giving a commitment, they're starting it immediately, to recover their remains. And I just went through how many people asked me about it. I was amazed, actually. So many people would ask me: \"Is it possible? Is it possible?\" At that time we had no relationship to Chairman Kim or to anybody else in North Korea. You know, it was a very closed society. So we're getting the remains back.\nSecured the halt of all missile and nuclear tests for—how long has it been? Seven months? You haven't had a missile go up. For 7 months, you haven't had a nuclear test; you haven't had a nuclear explosion. I remember a nuclear event took place, 8.8 in the Richter scale. And they announced—I heard it on the radio, they announced that a massive—you know, an earthquake took place somewhere in Asia. And then, they said it was in North Korea. And then, they found out it was a nuclear test. I said, \"I never heard of a Richter scale in the high 8s.\"\nAnd if you look, there has been no missile launches. They've blown up their missile area. That's going to take place. That has not been written into the contract. We're going to give you the exact details on that. But they secured a halt of all missiles and of all nuclear tests. They secured the closure of their single primary nuclear test flight—test site. All three of them—they're in an area that's common around each other—they secured the closure.\nThey secured the commitment to destroy the missile engine testing site. That was not in your agreement. I got that after we signed the agreement. I said: \"Do me a favor. You've got this missile engine testing site. We know where it is because of the heat.\" We—it's incredible the equipment we have, to be honest with you. I said, \"Can you close it up?\" He's going to close it up.\nWe maintained the ability to continue to apply sanctions. So we're applying sanctions. Now, I had 300 sanctions that I was getting ready to put on last week. And I said, you know, I can't really put on sanctions when I'm meeting with—I thought it would be very disrespectful. Three hundred very big ones, powerful ones. And I said it would be disrespectful.\nSo, Jennifer, when you look at all of those things that we got—and when we got our hostages back, I didn't pay $1.8 billion in cash like the hostages that came back from Iran, which was a disgraceful situation, what took place.\nSo we've gotten a lot. So when I hear somebody in the media say that President Trump has agreed to meet, like, it's not a big deal to meet. I think we should meet on a lot of different topics, not just this one. And I really believe a lot of great things can happen.\nSure. That's what they're doing. I mean, I don't think the——\nBecause there's no time. I'm here 1 day. We're together for many hours intensively, but the process is now going to take place. And I would be surprised, Mike, if they haven't even started already. They have started; they blew up their sites. They blew up their testing site.\nBut I will say, he knew, prior to coming—you know, this wasn't, like, a surprise. It wasn't like we've never discussed it. We discussed it. Mike discussed it very strongly with his counterpart in North Korea. They knew that this was—let's say they didn't agree to that I couldn't sign any agreement. There was no agreement that could have been signed. So they understood that.\nAnd it wasn't a big point today because, really, this had been taken care of, more than any other thing. Because it was all about this. This has been taken care of before we got here. So when we brought that up today, you see the language. It's very strong. It's in the document.\nYes, ma'am.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations/North Korea-South Korea Relations\nWell, I don't want to talk about—yes, I know. That's a tough thing to talk about because I don't want to be threatening. I don't want to be threatening. They understood that. And you've seen what was, perhaps, going to happen.\nAnd you know, Seoul has 28 million people. We think we have big cities. You look at New York, where it has 8 million people. We think it's a big city. Seoul has 28 million people. Think of that. And it's right next to the border. It's right next to the DMZ. It's right there. I mean, if this would have happened, I think—you know, I've heard, oh, a hundred thousand people. I think you could have lost 20 million people, 30 million people. This is really an honor for me to be doing this, because I think, you know, potentially, you could have lost, you know, 30, 40, 50 million people. The city of Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, is right next to the border.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations/Japan\nWell, at that time we needed, perhaps, fire and fury. Because we could not have allowed that kind of capability from the standpoint of the United States. And certainly, Japan wasn't going to allow it either. Japan is right next door.The President's Video Presentation to Chairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea\nYes.\nToday. Yes, we had it made up by some—I hope you liked it. I thought it was good. I thought it was interesting enough to show, one in English and one in Korean. And we had it made up. I showed it to him today. Actually, during the meeting—toward the end of the meeting. And I think he loved it. He—they were giving—we didn't have a big screen like you have the luxury of having. We didn't need it because we had it on a cassette and—an iPad. And they played it. And about eight of their representatives were watching it, and I thought they were fascinated.\nBut I thought it was well done. I showed it to you, because that's the future. I mean, that could very well be the future. And the other alternative is just not a very good alternative. It's just not good. But I showed it because I really want him to do something. Now, I don't think I had to show it because I really believe he wants to—I think he wants to get it done.\nHe wrote the best story about me with the Staten Island Ferry. And after that, he's never written a good story.\nI don't know what happened. It's a long time ago.\nWell, first of all, I think it's a very fair question. I had a very good meeting with the G-7. And I left the meeting. And, I'll be honest, we are being taken advantage of by virtually every one of those countries. Very, very seriously. Now, the United States, because of bad management at the top, because of Presidents that didn't care about trade or didn't understand it or whatever reason. For many years, with China being, obviously, the most successful at it, but the European Union is second—$151 billion we lost. They were represented at the meeting. And we're being taken advantage of on trade.\nCanada does have very big advantages over us in terms of trade deficits. We have a big trade deficit with Canada, I was reading, where, oh, it's actually a surplus. Not a surplus. It's either 17, but it could actually be 100. You know, they put out a document. I don't know if you saw it. They didn't want me to see it, but we found it. Perhaps they were trying to show the power they have. It's close to $100 billion-a-year loss with Canada. They don't take our farm products, many of them. They charge what was 270 percent, but somebody told me the other day that a few months ago they raised it to 295 percent for dairy products. And it's very unfair to our farmers, and it's very unfair to the people of our country: the workers, the farmers, the companies. And we are not able to trade. They have tremendous barriers up. They have tremendous tariffs.\nSo when I put in a countervailing tariff just to get us up a little bit so the balance isn't so much—it's like this—they said, \"Oh, that's so terrible.\" I said: \"What's terrible? We have to catch you a little bit. We have to have a little balance.\" Even if it's not complete, we have to have a little balance. I say this with many countries.\nAnyway, we came—we finished the meeting. Really, everybody was happy. And I agreed to sign something. I asked for changes; I demanded changes. And those changes were made. In fact, the picture with Angela Merkel, who I get along with very well, where I'm sitting there like this, that picture was we're waiting for the document, because I wanted to see the final document as changed by the changes that I requested.\nThat was a very friendly—I know it didn't look friendly, and I know it was reported like sort of nasty both ways. I was angry at her or she—actually, we were just talking, the whole group, about something unrelated to everything, very friendly, waiting for the document to come back so I could read it before I leave.\nAnyway, I left, and it was very friendly. When I got onto the plane, I think that Justin probably didn't know that Air Force One has about 20 televisions, and I see the television. And he's giving a news conference about how he will not be pushed around by the United States. And I say, push him around? We just shook hands. It was very friendly.\nLook, countries cannot continue to take advantage of us on trade. The numbers are out. Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years—but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China. Eight-hundred billion dollars. A hundred fifty-one billion with the European Union. They don't take our agricultural products, barely. They don't take a lot of what we have, and yet they send Mercedes into us, they send BMWs into us by the millions. It's very unfair, and it's very unfair to our workers. And I'm going to straighten it out. And it won't even be tough. Okay? Thank you.\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nCanada-U.S. Relations/North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nI would like to involve Congress, yes. And no, I have a good relationship with Justin Trudeau. I really did. Other than he had a news conference that he had because he assumed I was in an airplane and I wasn't watching. He learned. That's going to cost a lot of money for the people of Canada. He learned. You can't do that. You can't do that.\nWe left. We had a very good relationship. I've had a good relationship with Justin. I have a good relationship with all. I have a very good relationship with Angela Merkel. But on NATO, we're paying 4.2 percent; she's paying 1 percent of a much smaller GDP than we have. We're paying 4.2 percent on a much larger—we're paying for—I mean, anyone can say—from 60 to 90 percent of NATO. And we're protecting countries of Europe. And then, on top of it, they kill us on trade. So you—we just can't have it that way. It's unfair to our taxpayers and to our people.\nBut no, I have a good relationship with Justin. And I have a, I think, a very good relationship with Chairman Kim right now. I really do. I think—I hope it's good because if it is, we're going to solve a very big problem. I think we've gone a long way to solving it today.\nShould we keep going for a little while? Sarah, I don't know. It's up to the legendary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Should we keep going, Sarah? Okay, we'll go. Well, I don't care. Hey, you know, it just means we get home a little later in the evening. Right?\nHow are you?\nNice to see you.\nThank you very much.\nBeautiful country. I did.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations\nYes. Well, we're getting together next week to go into the details.\nSecretary Pompeo. Yes. Next week, with John Bolton and our entire team, to go over the details and to get this stuff done. We want to get it done; he wants to get it done.\nWe're also working very much with South Korea. We're working with Japan. We're working with China, to a lesser extent, but we're working with China.\nI would come back gladly. Your Prime Minister was fantastic. We were with him yesterday. He's done a great job. It was very welcoming. It really, probably had—it probably made a difference, actually. It's a great place.\nThank you very much.\nYes, ma'am.\nChairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea/North Korea-South Korea RelationsQ.Thank you, Mr. President. What was it about that first interaction with Chairman Kim this morning that that made you decide not to walk away after you said that you would know within the first minute if he was sincere or not?\nYes. I've said that about relationships. I've said that about people. You know in the first second. Now, I was generous. I said 5 seconds. But you know in the first second, in some cases. Sometimes, that doesn't work out. But sometimes, it does.\nFrom the beginning, we got along. But there's been a lot of groundwork. This wasn't like we went and we started talking about—as you know, right? We didn't just come in and start talking about these very complex subjects that have been going on for 70 years. We've been discussing this for months. And you know, once the rhetoric stopped, once they did a great thing—you know, North Korea did a great thing by going to the Olympics. Because the Olympics—and President Moon will tell you this—the Olympics was not exactly doing great. People didn't feel like being bombed out of the opening ceremonies. You know, they weren't exactly selling tickets. And as soon as the Chairman—Chairman Kim—said, \"Let's participate in the Olympics,\" it sold like wildfire and was a great success as an Olympics. It was a great success. He did a great thing.\nBut since that time, pretty much since that time—because, as you know, a delegation came from South Korea who had just met with North Korea. They came to the White House. They told me lots of things, including the fact that they'd be willing to denuke. We have one of their great people here today. That they were willing to denuke. And once that started, we have been really talking about that from the end of the Olympics when the whole delegation came to say various things, including denuking.\nNorth Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program/North Korea-U.S. Relations\nWell, I think can you ensure anything? Can I ensure that you're going to be able to sit down properly when you sit down? I mean, you can't ensure anything. All I can say is they want to make a deal. That's what I do. My whole life has been deals. I've done great at it, and that's what I do. And I know when somebody wants to deal, and I know when somebody doesn't. A lot of politicians don't. That's not their thing, but it is my thing.\nI mean, again, this really could have been done, I think, easier a long time ago. But I know for a—I just feel very strongly—my instinct, my ability, or talent—they want to make a deal. And making a deal is a great thing for the world. It's also a great thing for China, because I can't imagine that China has, you know, is happy with somebody having nuclear weapons so close. So you know, that's—China was very helpful.\nSo I think he wants to make a deal. Can anybody be certain? But we're going to be certain soon, because the negotiations continue. Okay? Thank you very much.\nGo ahead.\nNo, I think I've helped them, because I think things will change. I think I've helped them. There's nothing I can say. All I can do is do what I can do. We have to stop the nuclearization. We have to do other things, and that's a very important thing. So at a certain point, hopefully, you'll be able to ask me a much more positive question or make a statement.\nBut not much I can do right now. At a certain point, I really believe he's going to do things about it. I think they are one of the great winners today, that large group of people that you're talking about. I think, ultimately, they're going to be one of the great winners as a group.\nYes, sir. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yes.\nNo. I want significant improvement. I want to know that it won't be happening. And again, once you start that process, there will be a point at which, even though you won't be finished for a while because it can't happen scientifically or mechanically, but you're not going to be able to go back. You know, once we reach that point, I'll start to give that very serious thought.\nWell, I think that South Korea and I think that Japan will help them very greatly. I think they're prepared to help them. They know they're going to have to help them. I think they're going to help them very greatly. We won't have to help them. The United States has been paying a big price in a lot of different places. But South Korea, which obviously is right next door, and Japan, which essentially is next door, they're going to be helping them. And I think they're going to be doing a very generous job and a terrific job. So they will be helping them.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead. Behind. Yes.\nThank you.\nI had an uncle who was a great professor for, I believe, 40 years at MIT. And I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time. He was a great expert. He was a great, brilliant genius, Dr. John Trump at MIT. I think he was there 40 years, I was told. In fact, the head of MIT sent me a book on my uncle. But we used to talk about nuclear. You're talking about a very complex subject. It's not just like: \"Oh, gee. Let's get rid of the nukes.\" It takes a period of time.\nBut the main period of time that I'm talking is that first period, when you hit a certain point, you can't go back. It's very hard to go back.\nWe don't know, but it will go pretty quickly.\nGo ahead. Sure.\nYes.\nWell, I think we have a lot of leverage. I think we have tremendous leverage. I do believe that China, despite my relationship with President Xi—a man who I told you I have great respect for and like, also, a lot. You know, we're having very tough talks on trade. And I think that probably affects China somewhat. But I have to do what I have to do. And I think, over the last 2 months, the border is more open than it was when we first started. But that is what it is. We have to do it. We had a—we have a tremendous deficit in trade, commonly known as a trade deficit. We have a tremendous deficit in trade with China, and we have to do something about it. We can't continue to let that happen.\nAnd I think that has had an impact on my relationship, in terms of the border. I don't think it has the relationship—you know, I don't think it affects my feeling or my relationship to President Xi. But when we first started, we weren't ready to go that route. And as we started preparing and getting ready to do that, I think that's had an impact on, frankly, the border. I—which is a shame. But I have to do it. I have no choice. For our country, I have to do it.\nSouth Korea will do whatever is necessary to get a deal done. And if that means we can't trade, well, then I'm not going to trade. They're definitely not going to trade. If they think—and they would do this with our concurrence—if they think that they can do some work because we're very far down the line—we're actually very far. You know, that document, when you read it today, that's far down the line. That's not something that just happened to be put together. This was done over months. And again, the rhetoric was important, and the sanctions were important. I don't even know which one was more important. They were both important.\nWell, David, I can tell you he understands. He understands it so well. He understands it better than the people that are doing the work for him. That is an easy one. As far as what he has, it's substantial. Very substantial. The timing will go quickly. I believe you'll see some good action. I mean, as an example, one of the things with the missile site, I think you're probably surprised to hear that—that was a throw-in at the end, the missile site.\nBut I really believe, David, that it's going to go very quickly. I really believe that it's going to go fast. And it is a very substantial arsenal. There's no question about it. You know, I used to say maybe it's all talk and no action. But we have pretty good intelligence into that. Although, probably less there than any other country—you understand that maybe better than anybody in the room—probably less there than any other country. But we have enough intelligence to know that what they have is very substantial.\nThis is why, David, I always say that this shouldn't have taken place so late into the process. Wouldn't this have been better if it was 5 years ago or 20 years ago or 15 years ago and we didn't have to worry about not having a successful meeting like today? So—and I still love my first interview with you, David. I still have that interview, actually.\nThank you.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations\nWe haven't set that up. We'll probably need another summit. We'll probably need—or meeting. We can use a different term. But we'll probably need another one. We'll probably—I will say this, we're much further along than I would have thought. I did not think we'd be here. I thought—and I've told people—I didn't want to build up people's hopes too much. I told people I thought that this would be a successful meeting if we got along, we developed a relationship, and we could have maybe gotten to this point in 3 or 4 months from now. But it really happened very quickly. A lot of that was because of the foundation that was, you know, put down before we met. A lot of things happened very fast. We didn't have—as an example, bringing back the remains. That was not one of the things that was on our agenda today. I brought that up at the very end because so many people have talked to me about it. And I brought it up at the very end. And he was really very gracious. Instead of saying, \"Well, let's talk about it the next time.\" He said: \"It makes sense. We will do it.\"\nAnd he knew—you know, they know where many of those incredible people are. Where they're buried along roads, along highways, along paths, usually, because our soldiers were moving back and forth, and they had to move rapidly. It's very sad. But he knew. And that was brought up at the very end. And you know, it was really great that he was able to do it. A lot of people are going to be very happy about that.\nThank you.\nThank you. Thank you for the nice way you treat us. [Laughter] We appreciate it. Really, it's very good. It's really beautiful what you do. Go ahead.\nAnd now I'll probably get this killer question. [Laughter]\nYes. It's all right.\nYes, it's a good question. So you saw a tape today, and that, I think, was done really well. But that was done at the highest level of future development. I told him, you may not want this. You may want to do a much smaller version of this. I mean, you're going to do something. But you may want to do a smaller version. You may not want that with the trains and the everything. You know, it's super—everything the top. And maybe you won't want that. It's going to be up to them. It's going to be up to them. It's going to be up to the people what they want. They may not want that. I can understand that too.\nBut that was a version of what could happen, what could take place. As an example, they have great beaches. You see that whenever they're exploding their cannons into the ocean, right? I said: \"Boy, look at the view. Wouldn't that make a great condo behind?\" [Laughter] And I explained, I said, \"You know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there.\" Think of it from a real estate perspective. You have South Korea, you have China, and they own the land in the middle. How bad is that, right? It's great. But I told him, I said, you may not want to do what's there. You may want to do a smaller version of it or—you know. And that could be.\nAlthough, I tell you what—he looked at that tape, he looked at that iPad, and I'm telling you they really enjoyed it, I believe. Okay?\nA couple more. Okay. We'll do three more. Yes. Go ahead. Go.\nNews Media/ North Korea-U.S. Relations\nYes. Hi, Brian.\nAm I on the cover again this week? [Laughter] Boy, have I—so many covers.\nHuh? I know. That's okay.\nIn what way?\nNo. I think that—I don't view it that way. See, I don't view it that way. I'll do whatever it takes to make the world a safer place. If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage—I mean, I understand what you're getting at. If I have to say I'm sitting on a stage with Chairman Kim and that's going to get us to save 30 million lives—could be more than that—I'm willing to sit on the stage. I'm willing to travel to Singapore very proudly, very gladly.\nAgain, I—you know, other than the fact that it is taking my time, they have given up a tremendous amount. They've given it up even before. And even add the Olympics to it. You know, you could add the Olympics to the question. They went to the Olympics. They took an Olympics that was going to be a massive failure that maybe wouldn't have even opened, and they made it a tremendous success by agreeing to participate. Add that to the list of things that they've done.\nSo, Brian, if I can save millions of lives by coming here, sitting down, and establishing a relationship with someone who's a very powerful man, who's got firm control of a country, and that country has very powerful nuclear weapons, it's my honor to do it.\nNo, I'm not concerned at all. We can use that video for other countries.\nGo ahead.\nGot impressed?\nOh.\nYes. He did a great deal. And he spent $3 billion and got nothing. And he started making nuclear weapons a day later.\nOkay. Good. I think we've just answered the question.\nOh, I understand them much better than you do.\nSure. Hi.\nAnd much more. And much more than that.\nNo. I think he'll do it. I really believe that. Otherwise, I wouldn't be doing this. I really believe it. And it was really the engine testing site, in addition to all of the other things that they've agreed to do. It was the—they have a very powerful engine testing site that, again, we're able to see because of the heat that they—that it emits. And yes, I'm able to—I'm very happy. I'll tell you what—I'm very happy with those two points—the two points you mentioned.\nBut I think you might be referring to the thing that's not in, which is the engine testing site. I think he's—I think—honestly, I think he's going to do these things. I may be wrong. I mean, I may stand before you in 6 months and say, \"Hey, I was wrong.\" I don't know that I'll ever admit that, but I'll find a—I'll find some kind of an excuse. [Laughter]\nOkay, one or two. One more. Come on.\nYes, go ahead. Sure.Q.Thank you, Mr. President.\nThank you. Thank you.\nChina-U.S. Relations\nYes. I will.\nWell, my expectation about China is that China is a great country with a great leader and a friend of mine. And I really believe that he's happy that we've made this kind of progress. And I've heard from him. But I will be calling him very shortly. Maybe even before I land. Okay?\nAnd I have to say, you know—and the United States is a great country. And we have set records economically: over $7 trillion in net worth addition to what we have. And we are almost twice the size, the economy of the United States. Nobody talks about this, because you do hear a lot about China, rightfully so. But the United States now is almost twice the size of the economy of China. We have a great country, and we're on a correct path.\nOh, South Korea? Where's South Korea? I think you deserve—go ahead. Go. You deserve one. [Laughter] Yes. You deserve one.\nYou speak great English.\nYes.\nI just want to tell him about the meeting. Very successful. And he'll be very much involved in the final negotiation. He's a very, very fine gentleman, also a friend of mine. And I look forward to speaking. He'll be very happy when he hears about—I've already sent word to him about what happened. I sent the document to him, actually, and all of the details behind the document. So I'll be talking to him very shortly.\nI'd like to have them involved also.\nWhat?\nMike, do they have a transcript? They probably have a rough transcript, which you can give us, if you have one.\nNo, they didn't record it. I don't think they recorded it. Are there any recordings of it? I wish there were. Because it is interesting stuff.\nSay it?\nI don't. We probably have some notes or something. But they have, actually, detailed notes, I would imagine. But we had a great conversation. It was a very heartfelt conversation.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations\nWell, I don't have to verify because I have one of the great memories of all time. So I don't have to. Okay? Okay?\nYes, but I don't want to discuss it. But we did is we've had numerous discussions. We've had very important relationships established at Mike's level and other levels. In fact, a couple of people are here from, as you know, from North Korea. They're in the room. We have a few people in the back also, in the room.\nSo when we went into this final agreement, very importantly, we really didn't go in cold. We went in with tremendous relationship and tremendous knowledge. And I think that's why we got it done.\nSo I'm going to head back. I don't know about you folks, but it's been a long time since I've taken it easy. So now we can take it a little bit easy, and then the work begins again. And I appreciate everybody being here. I hope we've answered your questions. And thank you very much. And, sort of, congratulations to everybody, because this is, really—to me it's a very important event in world history. And to be really true to myself, I have to add, I want to get it completed. So Mike, our whole team has to get to work and get it completed. Because otherwise, we've done a good job. But if you don't the ball over the goal line, it doesn't mean enough. Okay?\nSo thank you, and, sort of, congratulations to everybody in the room. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nI feel good, very good. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-sentosa-island-singapore"}
{"Title": "Interview with Bret Bairer of Fox News", "Date": "2018-06-13", "Text": "I'm now on my 26th. We've been negotiating with some very good negotiators. Nice to be with you.\nI took a lot of them. And we had a lot of reporters. I don't know if you saw that room but their credentials were like record kinds of numbers and I took as many as I could. People are really happy about it, and even I would say non-Trump fans, people are really happy. It's something that I'm very proud of. Now, with that being said, I want to get it done, but I believe that Chairman Kim wants to get it done.\nI do.\nSure. No, it could happen. I mean all of a sudden --\nIt's deals -- whether it's this, which is so important or buying a building or doing whatever you may be doing. No, I don't think that's going to happen but I said, you know, I only consider it successful if it gets done. I think we've done something very historic already in one way, but to me success is when it gets done.\nNo, it's not drawing down at all. In fact, honestly it was never discussed. I'm sure he would like that. It was never on the table. You know, when I met him today, we have a very good relationship I feel. I feel it's good.\nYou know when we have chemistry -- you know it as well as anybody. And you understand what I mean. But when I met him today -- we had done three months, almost four months worth of work prior to my meeting. So we sort of understood that was never on the table. With that being understood and, you know, you asking a question like that, I would love to get the military out as soon as we can because it cost a lot of money, a lot of money for us. We don't get paid fully for that military which, you know, I will be talking to South Korea about. But we have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea. I would like to get them home. I would like to. But it is not on the table right now. At the appropriate time, it will be.\nNo, I think China really would like to see no nuclear weapons if you want to know the truth because look, whether you are semi-friendly with a nation or not when they have nuclear weapons and you're that close, it can't be a positive feeling. It just can't be. So China has been very helpful. I think over the last two months, maybe less so. I think the border got a little bit more open. Now, it didn't affect today's negotiation but I think the border opened up a little bit more because China could be a little bit upset about trade because we are very strongly clamping down on trade.\nWell, I think very strongly. I mean you will see over the next couple of weeks. They understand what we're doing. With that being said, I have a very good relationship with President Xi, he's an incredible guy. Just, you know, essentially presidential life -- it's pretty good.\nYes. But that's with a different president and nobody has taken it this far. And presidents have never met with anybody from North Korea. It's been, you know, delegated to other people.\nAnd even if they did meet they wouldn't have been able to pull it off. But this is something that should have been done years ago. I mean you've heard me say it many times. This should have been done 10 years, 15, 20 years ago. This shouldn't be done now where they have an arsenal of nuclear weapons. It should have never allowed to get to this point. With that being said, Chairman Kim wants to resolve the problem because he knew that we weren't playing around. I wasn't playing around. He's not playing around. We have a very -- I really say for, you know, for a fairly short term relationship because it was unbelievably hostile, the rhetoric. Rhetorically it was unbelievably hostile. And I think we have a very good relationship. We understand each other.\nHe's a tough guy. Hey, when you take over a country, tough country, tough people and you take it over from your father, I don't care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have. If you can do that at 27 years old, I mean that's one in 10,000 that could do that. So he's a very smart guy. He's a great negotiator, but I think we understand each other.\nYes. But so have a lot of other people done some really bad things. I mean I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done. Now look, with all of that being said, the answer is yes, I'm going from today. I'm going from maybe 90 days ago because we really started this -- we got a call that he was going to the Olympics. He would like to go to the Olympics and that was sort of the beginning of what we have right now. And we are very far down the line. You saw the agreement -- nobody thought we were going to have an agreement like that. And things were given to me as you know from the news conference, things were given to me, Bret, that were not even part of the agreement. I got them after we had signed the agreement.\nI'm totally confident. And if we can't, we can't have a deal. We have to be -- you know, it has to be verified. But one of the things that really I'm happy is that the soldiers that died in Korea, their remains are going to be coming back home. And we have thousands of people that have asked for that, thousands and thousands of people. So many people asked when I was on the campaign, I don't have any relationship, but they said when you can, president, we would love our son to be brought back home -- you know, the remains. And I asked -- we had pretty much finished and I said would you do me a favor? The remains of these great fallen heroes, can we do something? He agreed to it immediately. It was pretty great.\nI think psychologically he felt it was important and I understand that. But again, this should not have been happening now. This should have happened years ago. And I'm not blaming President Obama, I'm saying during Obama, during Bush, during Clinton -- this should have happened. Clinton got played. I mean when you look at what happened, he gave billions of dollars and it was like just a total waste of money.\nIt really wasn't rocky when I left, it was great. In fact, I spoke to Prime Minister Abe. It was great when I left. I spoke to him just recently. I just told him about what had happened and he said it's amazing because you left it was like -- I negotiated a different kind of deal than they wanted but I was ok with it I thought. And then I saw what took place at this news conference. I said that is not really what happened.\nNo, but the question was asked by a reporter. It used to be the G-8, Russia was included. And about four or five years ago they expelled Russia. And a reporter asked me do you think you would be better off with Russia and I said absolutely. You know, we spend probably 25 percent of our time talking about Russia. I said to myself, wouldn't it be better if they were here? Now, I'm not for Russia. I'm for the United States. But as an example, if Vladimir Putin were sitting next to me today instead of one of the others and we were having dinner the other night in Canada I could say would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Syria? Would you do me a favor? Would you get out of Ukraine? Get out of Ukraine, you should be there. Just come on. I think I would probably have a good relationship with him or I would be able to talk to him better than if you call somebody on the telephone and talk. If I'm sitting like I was with the others -- for instance new prime minister of Italy. He is a great guy. We had a great relationship. He agrees with me on Putin, by the way, I have to tell you. But this wasn't anything that was up for a vote. This was a reporter asking a question. I said yes, I think it's better off as a G-8 rather than a G-7 and a lot of people agree with me. But I will tell you as an example, if he were at that meeting I could ask him to do things that are good for the world, that are good for our country, that are good for him.\nYes, but he didn't -- I'm not sticking up for anybody. I'm just saying this, he didn't respect our leadership previously. He walked all over them. Look what he did to Obama with Crimea. He took Crimea. He took Ukraine -- I mean sections of Ukraine --\nNo, I know but he didn't respect our leadership. He didn't respect it and so -- but this wasn't me. You know people say well, look what he did. He did it to Obama. Obama should not have allowed that to happen -- even with the voter stuff. Supposedly the FBI went to Obama. They told him about it. He didn't do anything about it.\nSo Bret -- I saw on your show and I've seen 120 days ago we were down 16 points. Now I see Reuters has us up 2 and another one was up 6 and one it was down 3. I think it's a whole different ball game. I think the economy is so good. I think the tax cuts have been incredible, far greater than even I thought they would be. The regulation cuts have been great. I mean I've done more in 500 days than any president has ever done in their first 500 days. There's nobody close, and that's not -- that's a lot of people saying that. People that would rather not say it are saying it. And I really think that we are going to do very good. Now, history is against me because history for whatever reason, you win the election and then you lose lots of seats. I think we are going to do very well, I really do. The economy is doing so well. We are doing so well as a nation. I think we are going to surprise people and if you look at the numbers and if you look at the kind of turnouts like Texas, how many people showed up to vote as an example, how many Republicans showed up to vote -- people were very surprised.\nWe're holding up -- I'm very impressed because we are holding up Air Force One for you.\nThat's pretty good. That's a big plane to be holding.\nThank you very much. Thank you very much -- Bret. Appreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-bret-bairer-fox-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Brussels, Belgium", "Date": "2018-07-12", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. We've had a very amazing 2-day period in Brussels. And we really accomplished a lot, with respect to NATO. For years, Presidents have been coming to these meetings and talked about the expense—the tremendous expense—for the United States. And tremendous progress has been made; everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment. They're going to up it at levels that they've never thought of before.\nPrior to last year, where I attended my first meeting, it was going down—the amount of money being spent by countries was going down and down very substantially. And now it's going up very substantially. And commitments were made. Only 5 of 29 countries were making their commitment. And that's now changed. The commitment was at 2 percent. Ultimately, that'll be going up quite a bit higher than that.\nSo we are—we made a tremendous amount of progress today. It's been about, at a minimum, they estimate—and they're going to be giving you exact numbers—but since last year, they've raised an additional $33 billion that's been put up by the various countries, not including the United States.\nAnd the United States commitment to NATO is very strong, remains very strong, but primarily because everyone—the spirit they have, the amount of money they're willing to spend, the additional money that they will be putting up has been really, really amazing to see it. To see the level of spirit in that room is incredible.\nAnd I hope that we're going to be able to get along with Russia. I think that we probably will be able to. The people in the room think so, but they nevertheless—they really stepped up their commitment and stepped it up like they never have before.\nSo took in an addition $33 [billion; White House correction.].* The number could actually be higher than $40 [billion; White House correction.]* when they give you the final number. The Secretary General, Stoltenberg, will be giving those numbers sometime today, probably in his concluding press statement. But we are doing numbers like they've never done before or ever seen before. And you'll be seeing that, and I guess you'll be hearing that a little bit later.\nYes.\nI told people that I'd be very unhappy if they didn't up their commitments very substantially, because the United States has been paying a tremendous amount, probably 90 percent of the cost of NATO. And now people are going to start and countries are going to start upping their commitments. So I let them know yesterday, actually. I was surprised that you didn't pick it up; it took until today. But yesterday I let them know that I was extremely unhappy with what was happening, and they have substantially upped their commitment, yes. And now we're very happy and have a very, very powerful, very, very strong NATO, much stronger than it was 2 days ago.\nYes, ma'am.\nYes, hi. How are you?\nI know. You're very famous on television. [Laughter].\nWell, they were probably worried, because the United States was not being treated fairly, but now we are, because the commitment has been upped so much. So now they are. And I was very firm yesterday.\nYou have to understand, I know a lot of the people in the room. I was here last year. I let them know last year—in a less firm manner, but pretty firm—and they raised an additional $33 billion, I think going to $40 billion. But it's $33 billion as of today. And then, today and yesterday I was probably a little bit more firm.\nBut I believe in NATO. I think NATO is a very important—probably the greatest ever done. But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate. That's not fair to the United States.\nIn addition to that, as you know, we're in negotiations with the EU, and we're going to be meeting with them next week. We've been treated very unfairly on trade. Our farmers have been shut out of the European Union. Now, you could say they're different, but basically, to a large extent, they're the same countries.\nSo I think we're going to be ultimately treated fairly on trade. We'll see what happens, but I can tell you that NATO now is really a fine-tuned machine. People are paying money that they never paid before. They're happy to do it. And the United States is being treated much more fairly.\nYes, sir.\nYes.\nWell, if you consider putting up tremendously—you know, the additional funds at a level that nobody has ever seen before, I don't think that's helping Russia. I think that NATO is much stronger now than it was 2 days ago. I think that NATO was not doing what they were supposed to be doing, a lot of the countries. And we were doing much more than we should have been doing.\nFrankly, we were carrying too much of a burden. That's why we call it burden-sharing. I was using the term a lot today, \"burden-sharing.\" We had a fantastic meeting at the end—29 countries. And they are putting up a lot. Germany has increased very substantially their time period, and Germany is coming along. And we still have to figure out what's going on with the pipeline, because the pipeline is coming in from Russia.\nSo we're going to have to figure that out. I brought it up; nobody brought it up but me, and we all are talking about it now. And actually, I think the world is talking about it now, maybe more than anything else. But we're going to figure that out.\nBut—and frankly, maybe everybody is going to have a good relationship with Russia so there will be a lot less problem with the pipeline. But, to me, that was a very major point of contention. We discussed it at length today. Germany has agreed to do a lot better than they were doing, and we're very happy with that. We had a very good relationship with Angela Merkel.\nYes, go ahead.\nYes. After all these years, I know, Margaret. [Laughter] Go ahead.\nI think I probably can, but that's unnecessary. And the people have stepped up today like they've never stepped up before. And remember the word—$33 billion more, they're paying. And you'll hear that from the Secretary General in a little while. He thanked me actually. He is—he actually thanked me. And everybody in the room thanked me. There's a great collegial spirit in that room that I don't think they've had in many years. They're very strong. So yes, very unified, very strong. No problem. Right?\nYes, go ahead.\nNo problem.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nYes. So what they're doing is spending at a much faster clip. They're going up to the 2 percent level. Now, you have to understand, some of them have parliaments, they have their own congresses, they have a lot of things they have to go through. So, you know, they're here as Prime Minister or as a President, and they can't necessarily go in and say, this is what we're going to do. But they're going back for approvals.\nSome are at 2 percent; others have agreed definitely to go to 2 percent. And some are going back to get the approval—and which they will get—to go to 2 percent. After the 2 percent, we'll start talking about going higher. But I said, \"Ultimately, we should be, in years—in advance—we should be at 4 percent.\" I think 4 percent—it's the right number.\nNow, the United States—depending on the way you calculate it—was at 4.2 percent. And I said, \"That's unfair\". And we have the largest GDP by far, especially since we've increased it by so much since a thing called the election. Our GDP has gone way up. And so the fact that our GDP went way up, that means we're paying for even more, which is very unfair. So I explained that.\nWe will go to much higher than 2 percent into the future, but right now we're getting people up to 2 percent, and that will take place over a fairly short period of time—a short number of years. Okay?\nYes, go ahead.\nCongratulations, by the way.\nOn soccer.\nNo, that's other people that do that. I don't. I'm very consistent. I'm a very stable genius. [Laughter]\nGo ahead. Yes, go ahead.\nHi, Jeremy.\nNo, much—many of them—in fact, Germany was going to be in the year 2028 or '30. Yes, I think it's a very effective way to deal, but I didn't deal exactly the way you said. I have great respect for Germany. My father is from Germany. Both of my parents are from the EU, despite the fact they don't treat us well on trade.\nBut I think that will change also, and I think we'll see that, because on the 25th of July, they're coming in to start negotiations with me. We'll see. And if they don't negotiate in good faith, we'll do something having to do with all of the millions of cars that are coming into our country and being taxed at a virtually zero level, at a very low level.\nBut, Jeremy, I think it's been a very effective way of negotiating. But I'm not negotiating; I just want fairness for the United States. We're paying for far too much of NATO. NATO is very important. But NATO is helping Europe more than it's helping us. At the same time, it's very good for us.\nSo we have now got it to a point where people are paying a lot more money, and that's starting—really, last year. It really had—you were there last year. And last year, we had a big impact. Again, we took in $33 billion more. And if you ask Secretary General Stoltenberg, he gives us total credit—meaning me, I guess, in this case, total credit—because I said it was unfair.\nNow, what has happened is, Presidents over many years, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, they came in, they said, \"Okay, hey, do the best you can,\" and they left. Nobody did anything about it. And it got to a point where the United States was paying for 90 percent of NATO. And that's not fair. So it's changed. We had a really good meeting today. We had a great meeting in terms of getting along. I know most of the people in the room because of last year, because of the year and a half that we've been in office—year and a half-plus. But we have a great relationship. Everybody in that room, by the time we left, got along. And they agreed to pay more, and they agreed to pay it more quickly.\nYes, go ahead, Phil.\nHi, Phil.\nI think it's another very strong ally, as together it's much stronger than, obviously, individual countries. I think it's—the way we have it now, I think it's a much—I think NATO got—you know what was happening with spending prior to my getting into office. The\nnumbers were going down. Now the numbers have gone up like a rocket ship. The numbers have gone up a lot, and they've gone up rapidly. And they're now going up further.\nSo I think NATO is going to be very, very effective. I'm very impressed with—and really know, and he's a friend mine—but Secretary General Stoltenberg has done a fantastic job and putting it all together. And we were the ones that really—we gave him an extension of his contract, as you know. I think he's done a really good job.\nI think that when I was saying that, I am very concerned with the pipeline; I don't like the pipeline. And when I talk about NATO, I say, how do you have NATO? And then, you have somebody paying the people that you're protecting against. But maybe we'll get along with the group that we're protecting against. I think that's a real possibility.\nAs you know, I'm meeting with President Putin on Monday. And I think we go into that meeting not looking for so much. We want to find out about Syria. We will, of course, ask your favorite question about meddling. I will be asking that question again. But we'll also be talking about other things. We'll be talking about Ukraine. Ukraine was here today, by the way. And you know, it was very interesting to hear what they had to say. So——\nExcuse me?\nWell, he may. I mean, look, he may. You know, what am I going to do? He may deny it. I mean, it's one of those things. All I can do is say, \"Did you?\" and \"Don't do it again.\" But he may deny it. I mean, we'll—you'll be the first to know. Okay?\nYes, go ahead.\nYes. Hi, Robert.\nWell, they will. They will. I have no doubt about it. They all made commitments. And they will be up to 2 percent. It will be over a period of—a relatively short period of years. Okay?\nYes, go ahead.\nGeorgia?\nThey were here today, representing.\nWell, they were here. They made a very favorable impression. And we listened to their plight. It's a tough situation with Georgia. But they made a very fair verbal impression in the room. Okay?\nYes, go ahead. Go. Go. One more. Go ahead.\nYes, you really did. Come on. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nOh, that's an interesting question—because long before I got here, President Obama allowed that to happen. That was on his watch, not on my watch. You know, people like to say, \"Oh, Crimea.\" But the fact is, they built bridges to Crimea. They just opened a big bridge that was started years ago. They built, I think, a submarine port, substantially added billions of dollars. So that was on Barack Obama's watch. That was not on Trump's watch. Would I have allowed it to happen? No, I would not have allowed it to happen. But he did allow it to happen, so that was his determination.\nWhat will happen with Crimea from this point on? That I can't tell you. But I'm not happy about Crimea. But again, that was Barack Obama's watch, not Trump's watch.\nYes, go ahead. Sure.\nSure. I know, Jeff.\nYes.\nYes.\nWell, perhaps we'll talk about that. But I will say that we are going to be talking about those three issues and many more. We'll be talking about it, Jeff. Okay?\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization/U.S. Military\nWell, the money will be spent properly. And one of the things that we have—we have many wealthy countries with us today, but we have some that aren't so wealthy. And they did ask me if they could buy the military equipment and could I help them out. And we will help them out a little bit. We're not going to finance it for them, but we'll make sure that they're able to get payments and various other things so they can buy.\nBecause the United States makes, by far, the best military equipment in the world: the best jets, the best missiles, the best guns. The best everything—we make, by far. I mean, that's one thing—I guess I assumed it prior to taking office, but I really learned, since being President, our equipment is so much better than anybody else's equipment when you look at our companies: Lockheed and Boeing and Grumman. What—the material, the equipment that we make is so far superior, everybody wants to buy our equipment. In fact, it's the question, can they make it? Because they are doing very well. Can they make it for so many people?\nSo we are helping some of those countries get on line and buy the best equipment.\nYes, go ahead.\nYes. Just the opposite of concern. They actually—and they'll probably come out with a little bit of an edict—but they actually thanked me for meeting with President Putin. I look forward to the meeting. They thanked me. They thought it was a great thing that I was doing it. And they gave us our best wishes, or their best wishes.\nNow, with that being said, we'll see that happens. Just a loose meeting. It's not going to be big schedule. I don't think it should take a very long period of time. And we'll see where it leads. But it could lead to productive—something very productive. And maybe it's not.\nBut I think meeting with people is great. We had a great meeting with Chairman Kim. And I'll tell you, Mike Pompeo did a fantastic job. I might ask you to say a few words, Mike, while you're here.\nJust 1 second. Mike, go ahead.\nSecretary of State Michael R. Pompeo.I'm done. Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. So, I did. I returned—I actually came straight from North Korea with a couple of stops here to Brussels. We had a productive conversation. There remains a great deal of work to do, but I think, most importantly, my counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, made a commitment consistent with what President Trump was able to achieve with Chairman Kim, which was: They intend to denuclearize. They're going to accomplish it. And now the task is to get it implemented.\nI think, just to finish on that, you know, it's so important. That was an amazing—really, an amazing meeting, I thought. And I really think that we established very good\nrelationships. We'll see where it all ends. But there have been no missile tests. There have been no research. Where there has been—they have blown up a site; I hear they're blowing up another site—missile site. They've taken down all of the propaganda. In fact, somebody said, \"There's no more music playing at the border line.\" You know, the music was going on for many years. They said recently that, \"Wow, there's no more of the heavy music and the propaganda.\" They've done a lot of things. And we got back our three hostages.\nSo it's a good process. But the main thing is, there have been no rocket launches. There have been no missile tests. There's been no nuclear tests, no explosions, no nothing, for almost 9 months.\nYes, please. Sure.\nI think it's fine. I mean, I think they like me a lot in the U.K. I think they agree with me on immigration. I'm very strong on immigration. I made a point today—I said: \"You've got to stop. You're ruining your—you're going to have a lot of problems.\" You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration. I probably, at least partially, won an election because of immigration.\nIf you look at Italy, Giuseppe, who I got to know quite well over the last month and a half, he won his election because of strong immigration policies on Italy. I think that a lot of the people in the U.K.—I think that's why Brexit happened. Now, I don't know what's going on with the negotiation. Who knows? But—and I guess that's become a very interesting point of contention. I said I'm going to a few hotspots. We have NATO, then we have the U.K, and then we have Putin. And I said: \"Putin may be the easiest of them all. You never know.\" But I'm going to a pretty hotspot right now, right, with a lot of resignations.\nBut I will say that immigration is a very important thing, and I told them today, the EU—the European Union—better be very careful, because immigration is taking over Europe, and they'd better be very, very careful. And I said that loud and clear.\nYes, go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, I think he's going to see about this summit—this has turned out to be a very successful summit. This is—I think, really, that NATO is more put together right now, is more coordinated. And I think there's a better spirit for NATO right now than perhaps they've ever had. It's richer than it ever was. The commitments are made at a higher level than they've ever been made. And the money to be paid out faster, far faster.\nYou know, the 2 percent was a range, a goal. It wasn't something that they were committed to. Now it's a commitment. There's a big difference, the 2-percent number. And that's why so\nmany people weren't reaching it or hitting it. It was just sort of, like, this amorphous number out there. Now it's a commitment, a real commitment.\nI think he's going to see that there's great unity, great spirit, great esprit de corps. And I think we're going to have a good meeting. Regardless of that, I think we're going to have a good meeting.\nBut this was a fantastic 2 days. This was a really fantastic—it all came together at the end. And yes, it was a little tough for a little while, but ultimately—you can ask anybody at that meeting—they're really liking what happened over the last 2 days. There's a great, great spirit leaving that room.\nYes, sir. Go ahead. Please.\nWell, he's a competitor. He's been very nice to me the times I've met him. I've been nice to him. He's a competitor. You know, somebody was saying, \"Is he an enemy?\" No, he's not my enemy. \"Is he a friend?\" No, I don't know him well enough. But the couple of times that I've gotten to meet him, we got along very well. You saw that.\nI hope we get along well. I think we get along well. But ultimately, he's a competitor. He's representing Russia. I'm representing the United States. So in a sense, we're competitors. Not a question of friend or enemy. He's not my enemy. And hopefully, someday, maybe he'll be a friend. It could happen. But I—I just don't know him very well. I've met him a couple of times. And when I did meet him, most of you people were there.\nWell, Brexit is a—you know, I've been reading a lot about Brexit over the last couple of days, and it seems to be turning a little bit differently where they're getting at least partially involved back with the European Union.\nI have no message. It's not for me to say. I own a lot of property there. I'm going to Scotland while I wait for the meeting. I have Turnberry in Scotland, which is a magical place, one of my favorite places. I'm going there for 2 days while I wait for the Monday meeting.\nBut it's not for me to say what they should be doing in the U.K. I have great friendships. My mother was born in Scotland. I have great friendships over there. We have a wonderful Ambassador, Woody Johnson. And he's doing—by the way, Woody is doing a great job.\nBut it's not for me to say. I'd like to see him be able to work it so it could go quickly, whatever they work out.\nIs it heartbreaking?\nOh, hard Brexit. I see. [Laughter] I thought you said it was heartbreaking. I said, that might be going a little bit too far, right? [Laughter] Heartbreaking. Is it heartbreaking? A lot of things are heartbreaking.\nNo, I would say that Brexit is Brexit. It's not like—I guess we'll use the term \"hard Brexit.\" I assume that's what you mean. The people voted to break it up, so I would imagine that's what they'll do. But maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route. So I don't know if that's what they voted for. I just want the people to be happy. They're great people. And I do think I have—I'm sure there will be protests, because there are always protests.\nBut I think—hey, there were protests the night of the election, both ways. But in the end, we got 206 electoral—306 electoral votes. And one State said—you know, it was interesting, one of the States we won, Wisconsin—I didn't even realize this until fairly recently—that was the one State that Ronald Reagan didn't win when he ran the board his second time. He didn't win Wisconsin, and we won Wisconsin. So you know, we had a great night.\nProtests? They—there might be protests. But I believe that the people in the U.K—Scotland, Ireland. As you know, I have property in Ireland; I have property all over. I think that those people, they like me a lot, and they agree with me on immigration. And I think that's why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration.\nYes, ma'am. Yes, go ahead.\nWell, I can't tell you what would be the ultimate. What would be the ultimate? Well, let's see: No more nuclear weapons anywhere in the world would be the ultimate, okay? No more wars, no more problems, no more conflict. Let's find a cure to every disease known to mankind or womankind. [Laughter] That would be my ultimate, okay? And we'll start from there.\nHe's here right now.\nHe's here right now.\nYes.\nGhani.\nYes.\nI agree with that. I very much agree. It's been going on for a long time. We've made a lot of progress, but it's been going on for a long time. We've made a lot of progress in Afghanistan, I will say. Yes, your President is here right now. In fact, he's in the room. When I'm finished with this, I'm going right back into that room.\nWell, at a certain point, they'll have a chance. Not right now. They just left the room. But at a certain point, they'll have a chance.\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\nI think the Kurds are great people. They're incredible fighters. They're wonderful, warm, intelligent allies, in many cases. As you know, it's different groups of people. But they're great people. I really do, I believe they're great people.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nHe's a competitor.\nHey, I don't want him to be. And that's, I guess, why we have NATO, and that's why we have a United States that just had the largest military budget ever—$700 billion approved; $716 billion next year.\nNo, I hope that we'll be able to get along. I've often—I've said from day one, whether it's China or Russia—you know, we're working on trade with China right now, and I don't say that's an easy situation, because that's been years of abuse of the United States by Presidents, frankly, that allowed that to happen. So I've taken over a lot of bad hands, and I'm fixing each one of them, and I'm fixing them well.\nBut China is going to be, I think, very successfully, ultimately, taken care of. I have a great respect for their President, as you know—President Xi. I spent 2 days there. It was among the most magical 2 days I've ever lived. And I think we're going to end up doing something very good with China. Right now we're in a pretty nasty trade battle, but I think ultimately that will work out. I really think we have a big advantage.\nYou know, we've picked up $8 trillion in value, in worth, since I became President. And we're close to two times the size of China. A lot of people don't know that. And you know, we're going to negotiate a fair deal if that's possible.\nI would say there might be an escalation between us and the Iranians. I agree with that.\nBy the way, they're treating us with much more respect right now than they did in the past. And I think—I know they're having a lot of problems and their economy is collapsing. But I will tell you this: At a certain point, they're going to call me, and they're going to say, \"Let's make a deal,\" and we'll make a deal. But they are——\nThey're feeling a lot of pain right now.\nWe never talk about our future plans.\nYes, go ahead, ma'am. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nSo I hope we get along well with Iraq. We've certainly spent a great fortune in Iraq. And many, many lives—thousands and hundreds of thousands of lives, if you think on both sides, which I always think about both sides, not just our side. And they had an election, and I hope we're going to be able to get along, and we'll see how that goes. We've already been talking to the people that won the election. I was not in favor of that war. I was very much against that war. I never thought it was a good thing. But that's another deck of cards that I inherited, and we'll do the best we can with it.\nI think the election was pretty conclusive. And again, we've spoken to them. We'll see what happens.\nYes, sir. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nGood.\nAfrica/U.S. Military\nWe're looking for peace. And Africa, as you know, is on our very strong list. But we're looking for peace. We want peace all over. We want to solve problems. We're looking for peace. Africa, right now, has got problems like few people would even understand. They have things going on there that nobody could believe in this room. If you saw some of the things that I see through intelligence, what's going on in Africa, it is so sad and so vicious and violent. And we want peace. We want peace for Africa. We want peace all over the world. That's my number-one goal: peace all over the world.\nAnd we're building up a tremendous military, because I really believe, through strength, you get peace. But we're going to have a military like we've never had before. We've given out orders for the best fighter jets in the world, the best ships—the best everything.\nBut hopefully, we'll never have to use them. That would be a dream. To buy the best stuff, to have the best stuff, to have the best equipment in the world, and to never have to use it would be a really great part of my dream.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. I'm going to be going—leaving in about a half an hour. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-brussels-belgium"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom", "Date": "2018-07-13", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Prime Minister, thank you very much. And it is my true honor to join you at this remarkable setting—truly magnificent—as we celebrate the special relationship between our two countries. On behalf of the American people, I want to thank you for your very gracious hospitality. Thank you very much, Theresa.\nLast night Melania and I were delighted to join you and Philip for dinner at the magnificent Blenheim Palace. It was a wonderful and memorable evening that we will not soon forget. It was really something very special.\nToday it's a true privilege to visit historic Chequers that I've heard so much about and read so much about growing up in history class and to continue our conversation, which has really proceeded along rapidly and well over the last few days.\nFor generations, our predecessors have gathered at this stunning retreat to strengthen a bond that is like no other. The relationship between our two nations is indispensable to the cause of liberty, justice, and peace.\nThe United Kingdom and the United States are bound together by a common historic heritage, language, and heroes. The traditions of freedom, sovereignty, and the true rule of law were our shared gift to the world. They're now our priceless inheritance to a civilization. We must never cease to be united in their defense and in their renewal.\nBefore our dinner last night, Melania and I joined Prime Minister May, Mr. May, and the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough for a tour of the Winston Churchill exhibit at Blenheim Palace. It was something; it was something very special. It was from right here at Chequers that Prime Minister Churchill phoned President Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor. In that horrific war, American and British servicemembers bravely shed their blood alongside one another in defense of home and in defense of freedom. And together, we achieved a really special, magnificent victory. And it was total victory. Prime Minister May and I have just come from a very productive NATO summit—that was truly a productive summit—where my top priority was getting other NATO members to pay their full and fair share. And the Prime Minister was right there with me.\nI want to thank you, Prime Minister, for the United Kingdom's contribution to our common defense. The U.K. is one of the handful of nations—5 out of 29; not good, but it's going to get better really fast—in addition to the United States, meeting the 2-percent GDP minimum defense spending commitment. During the summit, I made clear all NATO allies must honor their obligations, and I am pleased to report that we have received substantial commitments from members to increase their defense spending and to do so in a much more timely manner.\nIn our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I discussed a range of shared priorities, including stopping nuclear proliferation. I thanked Prime Minister May for her partnership in our pursuit of a nuclear-free North Korea. She's been a tremendous help.\nThe Prime Minister and I also discussed Iran. We both agree that Iran must never possess a nuclear weapon and that I must halt, and we must do it—and I'm going to do it, and she's going to do it, and we're all going to do it together. We have to stop terrorism. It's the scourge. We have to stop terrorism. And we have to get certain countries—and they've come a long way, I believe—the funding of terrorism has to stop, and it has to stop now.\nI encouraged the Prime Minister to sustain pressure on the regime. And she needed absolutely no encouragement, because she, in fact, also encourages me. And we're doing that, and we're doing that together, very closely coordinated.\nThe United Kingdom and the United States are also strengthening cooperation between our Armed Forces, who serve together on battlefields all around the world.\nToday the Prime Minister and I viewed several U.S.-U.K. special forces demonstration—we saw some demonstrations today, frankly, that were incredible. The talent of these young brave, strong people. We saw it at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Seamless cooperation between our militaries is really just vital to addressing the many shared security threats. We have threats far different than we've ever had before. They've always been out there, but these are different, and they're severe. And we will handle them well.\nWe also recognize the vital importance of border security and immigration control. In order to prevent foreign acts of terrorism within our shores, we must prevent terrorists and their supporters from gaining admission in the first place. Border security is a national security problem. And in the United States, we are working very hard to get the Democrats to give us a couple of votes so we can pass meaningful and powerful border security.\nI also want to thank Prime Minister May for pursuing fair and reciprocal trade with the United States. Once the Brexit process is concluded, and perhaps the U.K. has left the EU—I don't know what they're going to do, but whatever you do is okay with me. That's your decision. [Laughter] Whatever you're going to do is okay with us. [Laughter] Just make sure we can trade together; that's all that matters. The United States looks forward to finalizing a great bilateral trade agreement with the United Kingdom. This is an incredible opportunity for our two countries, and we will seize it fully.\nWe support the decision of the British people to realize full self-government, and we will see how that goes. Very complicated negotiation and not an easy negotiation, that's for sure. A strong and independent United Kingdom, like a strong and independent United States, is truly a blessing on the world.\nPrime Minister May, I want to thank you again for the honor of visiting the United Kingdom, a special place. My mother was born here, so it means something maybe just a little bit extra, maybe even a lot extra. And we had a wonderful visit. Last night I think I got to know the Prime Minister better than at any time. We spent a lot of time together over a year and a half. But last night we really—I was very embarrassed for the rest of the table. We just talked about lots of different problems and solutions to those problems. And it was a great evening.\nAs we stand together this afternoon at Chequers, we continue a long tradition of friendship, collaboration, and affection between ourselves and also between our people. The enduring relationship between our nations has never been stronger than it is now.\nSo, Madam Prime Minister, thank you very much. It's been an honor. Thank you. Thank you, Theresa, very much.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nWell, maybe I'll go first, because I didn't criticize the Prime Minister. I have a lot of respect for the Prime Minister. And unfortunately, there was a story that was done, which was generally fine, but it didn't put in what I said about the Prime Minister. And I said tremendous things. And fortunately, we tend to record stories now, so we have it for your enjoyment if you'd like it. But we record when we deal with reporters. It's called fake news. You know, we solve a lot of problems with the good, old recording instrument.\nBut what happens is that—look, the Prime Minister, as I really just said, she's going to make a decision as to what she's going to do. The only thing I ask of Theresa is that we make sure we can trade, that we don't have any restrictions, because we want to trade with the U.K., and the U.K. wants to trade with us. We're, by far, their biggest trading partner. And we have just a tremendous opportunity to double, triple, quadruple that.\nSo if they're going a slightly different route—and I know they do want independence. It's going to be independence; it's just your definition. But if they're going to go a certain route, I just said that I hope you're going to be able to trade with the United States. I read reports where that won't be possible, but I believe after speaking with the Prime Minister's people and representatives and trade experts, it will absolutely be possible.\nSo, based on that, I—and based on just trade in general, and our other relationship—which will be fine—but the trade is a little bit tricky. We want to be able to trade, and they want to be able to trade, and I think we'll be able to do that. Okay? And I think she's doing a terrific job, by the way.\nJonathan Swan, go ahead.\nSo I'll be meeting with President Putin on Monday. We go into the meeting with a tremendous meeting that we had with NATO. Most of you have reported it correctly. It was—certainly it was testy at the beginning, but at the end, everybody came together, and they agreed to do what they should do—and actually, what they've committed to do, which you fully adhered to. You didn't have a problem, but some people did. And we left that meeting, I think, probably more unified and wealthier as a group than ever before. So we go in strong.\nWe'll be talking to President Putin about a number of things: Ukraine. We'll be talking about Syria. We'll be talking about other parts of the Middle East. I will be talking about nuclear proliferation, because we are massively—you know what we've been doing. We've been modernizing and fixing and buying. And it's just a devastating technology. And they, likewise, are doing a lot. And it's a very, very bad policy. We have no choice. But we are massively big, and they are very big. And I'll be talking about nuclear proliferation. That would be a great thing if we could do. Now, it's not only us. It's not only Russia and the United States. It's other countries also. But we're the two leaders. We would be the leader; they would be second. I guess China would be third. I think we'll all be talking about that. I—to me, Jonathan, I think that would be a tremendous—that would be a tremendous achievement if we could do something on nuclear proliferation.\nAnd we'll be talking about other things. I know you'll ask, will we be talking about meddling. And I will absolutely bring that up. I don't think you'll have any—\"Gee, I did it. I did it. You got me.\" There won't be a Perry Mason here, I don't think. [Laughter] But you never know what happens, right? But I will absolutely firmly ask the question.\nAnd hopefully we'll have a very good relationship with Russia. I—you know, I think having—and the Prime Minister would agree. We have a good relationship with Russia and with China and with other countries. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. So hopefully, that will happen, Jonathan. Okay?\nYes. The troops where, though? Where?\nWell, look, there is a benefit. There's a psychological benefit, and there's a military benefit. There's also a benefit not to do it. I mean, I was prepared to do things that would have been somewhat harsh yesterday. A lot of people were surprised that NATO all came together at the end.\nBut—and it wasn't a threat. I mean, it was just an unfair situation. The United States was paying, you know, anywhere from 70 to 90. And I choose 90, depending on the way you want to calculate. We were paying 90 percent for the cost—of the cost of NATO. And NATO is really there for Europe, much more so than us. It helps Europe whether—no matter what our military people or your military people say, it helps Europe more than it helps us.\nThat being said, it is a great unifier. You know, we have 29 countries. And there was a lot of love in that room. So I think—and we have a lot more than—you know, Jonathan, when you say 10,000 troops, we have a lot more than 10,000 troops.\nHow much?\nOh, tens of. I thought you said 10,000. Because in Germany, we have 52,000 troops. And we have—we have a lot of troops in Europe.\nThat being said, we're helping Europe. They're helping us. We're all together. And I'm fine with it.\nAnd by the way, very importantly, they're now paying their way in a much more rapid fashion.\nYou want me to go?\nI think it's been very bad for Europe. I think Europe is a place I know very well, and I think that what has happened is very tough. It's a very tough situation. I mean, you see the same terror attacks that I do. We see them a lot. We just left some incredible young men—men and women—at Sandhurst. And they were showing us cells, and they were showing us things that, frankly, 20 years ago nobody even thought about. Probably a lot more recently than that, nobody even thought about.\nI just think it's changing the culture. I think it's a very negative thing for Europe. I think it's very negative. I think having Germany—and I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel. Great relationship with Germany. But I think that's very much hurt Germany. I think it's very much hurt other parts of Europe.\nAnd I know it's politically—not necessarily—correct to say that. But I'll say it, and I'll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing culture. You are changing a lot of things. You're changing security. You're changing—look at what's happening. I mean, you take a look. I mean, look at what's happening to different countries that never had difficulty, never had problems.\nIt's a very sad situation. It's very unfortunate. But I do not think it's good for Europe, and I don't think it's good for our country. We're, as you know, far superior to anything that's happened before, but we have very bad immigration laws, and we're—I mean, we're doing incredibly well considering the fact that we virtually don't have immigration laws. We have laws that are so bad, I don't even call them laws. I call them—it's just like, you just walk across the border. You walk across the border—you put one foot on the land and now you're tied up in a lawsuit for 5 years. It's the craziest thing anyone has ever seen.\nSo I would just make that recommendation to Europe. I've made it very loud and clear. I made it yesterday in—29 countries total. And that's the way I feel.\n[Inaudible] That's—that's not true.\nSee, that's such dishonest reporting, because—of course, it happens to be NBC, which is possibly worse than CNN. Possibly. Possibly.\nPossibly. Let me explain something. We have left NATO with more money, with more unity, with more spirit than NATO probably has ever had. We have a strong and powerful NATO. When I became President, we didn't. We had people that weren't paying their bills; we had people that were way down. We had people that weren't following their commitments.\nIn addition to that, we've become an oil exporter, which would not have happened under the past regime or a new regime, if it weren't us. We have built up our military—$700 billion. And then, next year, as you know, $716 billion.\nWhen you look at what we've done in terms of Russia, I guarantee whoever it is in Russia, they're saying, \"Oh, gee, do we wish that Trump was not the victor in that election.\" We have been far tougher on Russia than anybody—anybody—and probably than—look, I'm not going to go down a hundred years, but certainly, we have been extremely tough on Russia, including the fact that, when the Prime Minister called, when they had a horrible thing happen right here—very close by—she asked would I do something. And maybe I'd let you tell the number, and it was far greater than anybody else, including the Prime Minister. We expelled how many people?\nYes, 60.\nAnd Germany did three, as an example. So Germany—big country, powerful country—they did three. The fake news doesn't want to talk about it. So it really is—we have been very strong on Russia.\nNow, with all that being said, if I had a relationship with Putin—I don't know him. I met him twice, maybe three times—two and a half times. Most of you were there when we did. We met him at the G-20. And if we could develop a relationship, which is good for Russia, good for us, good for everybody—that will be great. If I had a relationship with China—you know, we're in a big trade situation with China, as an example, where we're behind every year—for many years—$500 billion. It's just not going to happen anymore.\nSo if we got along with countries, that's a good thing. If we get along with China, Russia—that's a good thing, not a bad thing.Q.And I take your point, but when he sees the headlines about the fighting. I take your point about what happened——\nNo, no. No, the headline——\n——he sees isn't the headline—yes, there was fighting because I said, \"You got to put up—you got to put up more money. We have to be stronger. We have to be unified.\" The headline he sees isn't what's happening during the morning. The headline he sees is what happened in the afternoon, where we came together as one, where—where they're putting up billions of dollars more.\nI'll give you an example—and you know this is a confirmed number—$34 billion more was raised, since I became President, in NATO. That means that the other 28 countries have put in $34 billion more into NATO. Do you think Putin is happy about that? I don't think so. But we have a lot of false reporting in this country. I don't think you have that in your country. Do you, Prime Minister? [Laughter]\nOkay, go ahead. Ask the Prime Minister.\nFormer Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom/United Kingdom-U.S. Relations\nI'll respond. They said—unrelated—not related to—if we have the tape. You can ask Sarah; get it from Sarah. We taped the entire interview. They asked about Boris Johnson. I said, yes, they—\"How would he be as a Prime Minister?\" I said, \"He'll be a great Prime Minister.\" He's been very nice to me. He's been saying very good things about me as President. I think he thinks I'm doing a great job. I am doing a great job, that I can tell you, just in case you haven't noticed. [Laughter] But Boris Johnson, I think would be a great Prime Minister.\nI also said that this incredible woman, right here, is doing a fantastic job, a great job. And I mean that. And I must say that I have gotten to know Theresa May much betterover the last 2 days than I've known her over the last year and half. I mean, we spent more time in the last 2 days. Yesterday I had breakfast, lunch, and dinner with her. Then, I said, \"What are we doing tomorrow?\" Which is today. \"Oh, you're having breakfast and lunch with Theresa May.\" And I'm going to see you later on again.\nBut I've actually gotten to know her better than ever, and I think she's a terrific woman. I think she's doing a terrific job. And that Brexit is a very tough situation. That's a tough deal, between the borders and the entries into the countries and all of the things. So she's going to do the best.\nThe only thing I ask is that she work it out so that we can have very even trade, because we do not have a fair deal with the European Union, right now, on trade. They treat the United States horribly. And that's going to change. And if it doesn't change, they're going to have to pay a very big price, and they know what that price is. So they're coming over on July 25 to see me, and hopefully, we can work something out. But they have barriers that are beyond belief—barriers where they won't take our farm products, they won't take many of our things, including our cars. They charge us tariffs on cars far greater than we charge them. As you know—you know all these things.\nAnd last year, Theresa, we lost $151 billion with the European Union. So we can't have that. We're not going to have that any longer, okay? Thank you.\nSo I would say I give our relationship, in terms of grade, the highest level of special. So we start off with special. [Laughter] I would give our relationship with the U.K.—and now, especially after this 2 days with your Prime Minister, I would say the highest level of special.\nAm I allowed to go higher than that? I'm not sure. [Laughter] But it's the highest level of special. [Laughter] They are very special people. It's a very special country. And as I said, I have a relationship because my mother was born in Scotland. So it's very important.\nAs far as the advice, I did give her a suggestion. I wouldn't say advice. And I think she found it maybe too brutal, and that's okay—because I could see that. But I don't know if you remember what I said. But I did give her a certain amount of—I gave her a suggestion, not advice. I wouldn't want to give her advice. I'd give her a suggestion. I could fully understand why she thought it was a little bit tough. And maybe it's someday she'll do that. If they don't make the right deal, she might very well do what I suggested that she might want to do. [Laughter]\nBut it is not an easy thing. Look at the United States, how the European Union has taken advantage, systematically, of the United States, on trade. It's a disgrace. So it's not an easy negotiation.\nJohn Roberts [Fox News], go ahead. Go ahead, John.\nNo, no.\nJohn Roberts, go ahead. CNN is fake news. [Laughter]\nI don't take questions from CNN.Q.——you can take a question from CNN.\nCNN is fake news. I don't take questions from CNN.\nJohn Roberts of Fox.\nLet's go to a real network. John, let's go.\nThank you.\nRussia-U.S. Relations/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election\nI agree.\nYes.\nYes, I think so. I think I'd have a very good relationship with President Putin if we spend time together. And I may be wrong. You know, other people have said; it didn't work out. But I'm different than other people.\nI think that we're being hurt very badly by the, I would call it, \"the witch hunt;\" I would call it the \"rigged witch hunt,\" after watching some of the little clips. I didn't get to watch too much, because I'm here—it's a different time zone, to put it mildly. But after watching the people, the man that was testifying yesterday, I call it the \"rigged witch hunt.\"\nI think that really hurts our country and it really hurts our relationship with Russia. I think that we would have a chance to have a very good relationship with Russia and a very good chance—a very good relationship with President Putin. I would hope so.\nWell, that was—yes, they do. And if you're talking about Crimea primarily, yes. But again, President Obama failed very badly with Crimea. I don't think he would have done that if I were President. He took over Crimea, and he actually took it over during the Obama administration, I think you will admit.\nWell, we're going to see what happens. I mean, it's a process. If I knew, I wouldn't tell you, because that would put us at a disadvantage. But we'll see what happens. We'll see how it all mills out.\nBut I just want people to understand that Crimea was a—you know, it was another bad hand. I got handed North Korea. We're doing very well. I—you saw the letter yesterday. And we're doing very well. Look, we haven't had nuclear testing, we haven't had missile launches, we haven't had rocket launches. Some sites were blown up. And we got back our hostages, our prisoners, even before I left. So a lot of good things are happening. There's some good feeling there. We'll see what happens. It's a process. It's probably a longer process than anybody would like, but I'm used to long processes too.\nWe haven't taken off the sanctions. The sanctions are biting. We haven't taken them off.\nBut when it comes to Crimea, that's something I took over, John. There's nothing much I have to say about it, other than we will look at that just like I'm looking at many other disasters that I've taken over. I've taken over a lot of bad hands. And I'm fixing them one by one. And I know how to fix them. Okay?\nThank you, John.\nWell, if you remember, I was opening Turnberry the day before Brexit. And we had an unbelievably large number of reporters there, because everybody was there, I guess because of Brexit. And they all showed up on the ninth hole overlooking the ocean, and I said, \"What's going on?\" And they—all they wanted to talk about was Brexit. And they asked for my opinion, and I think you will agree that I said, \"I think Brexit will happen.\" And it did happen. And then, we cut the ribbon.\nAnd the reason I felt it was going to happen was because of immigration. Because I know—I think one of the reasons I got elected was because of immigration, and I felt that Brexit had the upper hand. And most people didn't agree with me. If you remember, Barack Obama said, well, that your country will have to get on the back of the line if that happened, which I thought was a terrible thing to say, frankly.\nBut I said I thought it was going to happen, and it did happen. And I also think that, as far as negotiating the deal, I probably would have done what my suggestion was to the Prime Minister, but my—but she can always do that. She can do that. At some point, she can do what I suggested to her.\nNo. Well, you can't walk away. Because if she walks away, that means she's stuck. You can't walk away. But you can do other things. But she can do what my suggestion was. And my suggestion was, you know, respectfully submitted. She will do very well. I think she's a very tough negotiator. I've been watching her over the last couple of days. She's a tough negotiator. She's a very, very smart and determined person.\nI can tell you, there are a lot of people that are looking up now saying, \"Gee, whiz, you know, she left a lot of people in her wake.\" She's a very smart, very tough, very capable person. And I would much rather have her as my friend than my enemy, that I can tell you.Prime Minister May. And we are friends, Mr. President.\nGo ahead.\nI like your hat.\nGood without it, too. Good head of hair. Good solid head of hair.\nNo, I know exactly what you have, Jeff.\nCome on, Jeff. Take it off. Will you show, please?\n[At this point, John Roberts of Fox News removed Mr. Mason's hat.]\nI like you better without the hat. Go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, it will be a slow process. Don't forget, we're not the only ones that have nukes. And it would be a slow process. But for the world, it would be us, and it would be others—would have to come along simultaneously, obviously.\nBut I think that when I—when the meeting was arranged—and we both wanted the meeting—when the meeting was arranged, it was—from my standpoint, I don't—I didn't go in with high expectations, but you may come out with something very exceptional.\nBut the proliferation is a tremendous—I mean, to me, it's the biggest problem in the world: nuclear weapons. Biggest problem in the world.\nI understand nuclear. Look up Dr. John Trump at MIT, who was my uncle. Many, many years a professor. I used to talk nuclear with him. And this is many years ago. It's the biggest problem, in my opinion, this world has. Nuclear weapons. So if we could do something to substantially reduce them—I mean, ideally, get rid of them. It's—maybe that's a dream. But certainly it's a subject that I'll be bringing up with him. And it's also a very expensive thing. But that's the least important. So if we can—if we can do something.\nBut I didn't go in—and I was telling the Prime Minister before—I didn't go in with high expectations. I mean, we have—we do have a political problem where, you know, in the United States, we have this stupidity going on—pure stupidity—but it makes it very hard to do something with Russia. Anything you do, it's always going to be: \"Oh, Russia. He loves Russia.\" I love the United States. But I love getting along with Russia and China and other countries. And it will certainly be, Jeff, something that we bring up and talk about. I think, to me, it's such a big problem.\nSyria, of course, I'm going to bring that up, and I'm going to bring up Ukraine. And I'm going to bring up other subjects also.\nWe're just going to talk about—yes, well, that was another one. I mean, the redline in the sand was a problem for us. I mean——\nWell, I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to talk to him about that before I talk to you. And if something happens, that will be great. And if it doesn't happen—I'm not going in with high expectations, but we may come out with some very surprising things.\nBut relationship is very important. And having a relationship with Russia and other countries, as I said a number of times, is—and I've been saying, actually, for years—and I've been certainly saying it during my campaign. Having relationships with other countries is really a good thing.\nI think that—I can't really overestimate how big the meeting was yesterday with NATO. We went with something that really was an unfair situation to something that's unified. I mean, they had spirit. Those people were getting up, and in the end, \"Well, we are committing and we're\"—you know, they can't go—it's not like they can go immediately back. They have to go through their parliaments and their congresses and their representatives and whoever, whatever form they have. But they have to go through an approval process.\nBut I'll tell you what: Every single person in that room was gung-ho to get it done, get the money in. And even before that, as you know, $34 billion. And I think that the Secretary General—Stoltenberg is doing a terrific job, by the way—he said yesterday that \"Because of President Trump, we've taken in $34 billion more for NATO.\" And I think the number is actually much higher than that. But $34 billion more, at least. And again, that's nothing that my opponent would have done. My opponent would have—it would have just kept going down. You know, it was going down. You see what was happening over the years. The numbers were going down. Now the number is way up, and now it's going way up higher. And that was—and he will tell you that—that was because of me.\nUnited Kingdom-U.S. Relations/Nord Stream 2 Russia-Germany Gas Pipeline\nAnd I have—just to finish off. Jeff, just to finish off, I have to say, I said to that paper, the Sun—and they seem like two very nice people—but I said that Theresa May——\n——is a—one of them is nice? But I said——[laughter]\nOh, good. Where is that person? Where? Did I say nice things about Theresa May, please?\nOh, good? Okay. If you reported them, that's good. Okay. Where? On the internet? [Laughter] I said very good things. Thank you very much for saying that. No, I said very good things about her. I didn't think they put it in, but that's all right. They didn't put it in the headline. I wish they put that in the headline. That's one of those things.\nAnd she's a total professional, because when I saw her this morning, I said, \"I want apologize, because I said such good things about you.\" She said, \"Don't worry, it's only the press.\" I thought that was very professional. [Laughter] I might add though—I might add—\nThat's called being—don't worry, I've been—they've been doing it to me, and I do it to them. I do say, though, the pipeline—you asked about the pipeline—to me, it is a tragedy. I think it's a horrific thing that's being done, where you're feeding billions and billions of dollars—from Germany primarily, and other countries, but primarily from Germany—into the coffers of Russia when we're trying to do something so that we have peace in the world. I think it's a horrible thing that Germany is doing. I think it's a horrible mistake. And as much as I like Angela, I was very open in saying it. I think it's a horrible thing that you have a pipeline coming from Russia, and I believe that Germany is going to be getting 50, 60, or even, I've heard, numbers of 70 percent of their energy coming in from Russia. And how can you be working for peace and working from strength when somebody has that kind of power over your country?\nI don't think it's good. You're not working from strength; you've given up all of your strength. I think it's very bad for Germany, very bad for the German people. And I don't think it's very good for NATO, if you want to know the truth. So, okay?\n[Many reporters began asking questions at once.]\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-theresa-may-the-united-kingdom-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia in Helsinki, Finland", "Date": "2018-07-16", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you. I have just concluded a meeting with President Putin on a wide range of critical issues for both of our countries. We had direct, open, deeply productive dialogue. It went very well.\nBefore I begin, I want to thank President Niinistö of Finland for graciously hosting today's summit. President Putin and I were saying how lovely it was and what a great job they did.\nI also want to congratulate Russia and President Putin for having done such an excellent job in hosting the World Cup. It was really one of the best ever, and your team also did very well. It was a great job.\nI'm here today to continue the proud tradition of bold American diplomacy. From the earliest days of our Republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility. A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world.\nThe disagreements between our two countries are well known, and President Putin and I discussed them at length today. But if we're going to solve many of the problems facing our world, then we are going to have to find ways to cooperate in pursuit of shared interests. Too often, in both recent past and long ago, we have seen the consequences when diplomacy is left on the table. We have also seen the benefits of cooperation. In the last century, our nations fought alongside one another in the Second World War. Even during the tensions of the cold war, when the world looked much different than it does today, the United States and Russia were able to maintain a strong dialogue.\nBut our relationship has never been worse than it is now. However, that changed as of about 4 hours ago. I really believe that. Nothing would be easier politically than to refuse to meet, to refuse to engage. But that would not accomplish anything. As President, I cannot make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics or the media or Democrats who want to do nothing but resist and obstruct.\nConstructive dialogue between the United States and Russia affords the opportunity to open new pathways toward peace and stability in our world. I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. As President, I will always put what is best for America and what is best for the American people.\nDuring today's meeting, I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections. I felt this was a message best delivered in person. We spent a great deal of time talking about it, and President Putin may very well want to address it, and very strongly—because he feels very strongly about it, and he has an interesting idea.\nWe also discussed one of the most critical challenges facing humanity: nuclear proliferation. I provided an update on my meeting last month with Chairman Kim on the denuclearization of North Korea. And after today, I am very sure that President Putin and Russia want very much to end that problem. They're going to work with us, and I appreciate that commitment.\nThe President and I also discussed the scourge of radical Islamic terrorism. Both Russia and the United States have suffered horrific terrorist attacks, and we have agreed to maintain open communication between our security agencies to protect our citizens from this global menace.\nLast year, we told Russia about a planned attack in St. Petersburg, and they were able to stop it cold. They found them. They stopped them. There was no doubt about it. I appreciated President Putin's phone call afterwards to thank me.\nI also emphasized the importance of placing pressure on Iran to halt its nuclear ambitions and to stop its campaign of violence throughout the area, throughout the Middle East.\nAs we discussed at length, the crisis in Syria is a complex one. Cooperation between our two countries has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives. I also made clear that the United States will not allow Iran to benefit from our successful campaign against ISIS. We have just about eradicated ISIS in the area.\nWe also agreed that representatives from our national security councils will meet to follow up on all of the issues we addressed today and to continue the progress we have started right here in Helsinki.\nToday's meeting is only the beginning of a longer process. But we have taken the first steps toward a brighter future and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought. Our expectations are grounded in realism, but our hopes are grounded in America's desire for friendship, cooperation, and peace. And I think I can speak on behalf of Russia when I say that also. President Putin, I want to thank you again for joining me for these important discussions and for advancing open dialogue between Russia and the United States. Our meeting carries on a long tradition of diplomacy between Russia, the United States, for the greater good of all.\nAnd this was a very constructive day. This was a very constructive few hours that we spent together. It's in the interest of both of our countries to continue our conversation, and we have agreed to do so.\nI'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future often, and hopefully, we will solve every one of the problems that we discussed today.\nSo, again, President Putin, thank you very much.\n[At this point, President Trump and President Putin shook hands, and President Putin spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nActually, I called him a competitor. And a good competitor he is. And I think the word \"competitor\" is a—it's a compliment. I think that we will be competing, when you talk about the pipeline. I'm not sure necessarily that it's in the best interest of Germany or not, but that was a decision that they made. We'll be competing—as you know, the United States is now, or soon will be—but I think it actually is right now—the largest in the oil and gas world.\nSo we're going to be selling LNG, and we'll have to be competing with the pipeline. And I think we'll compete successfully, although there is a little advantage locationally. So I just wish them luck. I mean, I did. I discussed with Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones. But I also know where they're all coming from. And they have a very close source. So we'll see how that all works out.\nBut we have lots of sources now, and the United States is much different than it was a number of years ago when we weren't able to extract what we can extract today. So today we're number one in the world at that. And I think we'll be out there competing very strongly.\nThank you very much.\nYes, I do. I hold both countries responsible. I think that the United States has been foolish. I think we've all been foolish. We should have had this dialogue a long time ago—a long time, frankly, before I got to office. And I think we're all to blame. I think that the United States now has stepped forward, along with Russia. And we're getting together. And we have a chance to do some great things, whether it's nuclear proliferation, in terms of stopping—because we have to do it. Ultimately, that's probably the most important thing that we can be working on.\nBut I do feel that we have both made some mistakes. I think that the probe is a disaster for our country. I think it's kept us apart. It's kept us separated. There was no collusion at all. Everybody knows it. People are being brought out to the fore.\nSo far, that I know, virtually none of it related to the campaign. And they're going to have to try really hard to find somebody that did relate to the campaign. That was a clean campaign. I beat Hillary Clinton easily. And frankly, we beat her—and I'm not even saying from the standpoint—we won that race. And it's a shame that there can even be a little bit of a cloud over it.\nPeople know that. People understand it. But the main thing, and we discussed this also, is zero collusion. And it has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world. We have 90 percent of nuclear power between the two countries. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous what's going on with the probe.\nWell, I'm going to let the President answer the second part of that question. But, as you know, the whole concept of that came up perhaps a little bit before, but it came out as a reason why the Democrats lost an election, which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the electoral college is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans.\nWe won the electoral college by a lot—306 to 223, I believe. And that was a well-fought—that was a well-fought battle. We did a great job.\nAnd, frankly, I'm going to let the President speak to the second part of your question. But just to say it one time again, and I say it all the time: There was no collusion. I didn't know the President. There was nobody to collude with. There was no collusion with the campaign. And every time you hear all of these—you know, 12 and 14—it's stuff that has nothing to do—and frankly, they admit, these are not people involved in the campaign.\nBut to the average reader out there, they're saying, \"Well, maybe that does.\" It doesn't. And even the people involved, some perhaps told mis-stories or, though in one case, the FBI said there was no lie. There was no lie. Somebody else said there was.\nWe ran a brilliant campaign, and that's why I'm President. Thank you.\nWell, I guess I'll answer the first part of the question. We've worked with Israel long and hard for many years, many decades. I think we've never—never has anyone, any country been closer than we are. President Putin also is helping Israel. And we both spoke with Bibi Netanyahu, and they would like to do certain things with respect to Syria having to do with the safety of Israel. So in that respect, we absolutely would like to work in order to help Israel, and Israel will be working with us. So both countries would work jointly.\nAnd I think that, when you look at all of the progress that's been made in certain sections with the eradication of ISIS—we're about 98 percent, 99 percent there—and other things that have taken place that we've done, and that, frankly, Russia has helped us with in certain respects. But I think that working with Israel is a great thing, and creating safety for Israel is something that both President Putin and I would like to see very much.\nOne little thing I might add to that is the helping of people—helping of people. Because you have such horrible, if you see—and I've seen reports and I've seen pictures, I've seen just about everything. And if we can do something to help the people of Syria get back into some form of shelter and—on a humanitarian basis. And that's what the word was, really, a humanitarian basis. I think that both of us would be very interested in doing that, and we are. We will do that.\nThank you very much.\nRussia-U.S. Military Coordination\nThank you. That's right. Thank you very much. We do host it. And we hope we do as good a job. That's very nice. That will go to my son Barron. We have no question. In fact, Melania, here you go. [Laughter]\n[President Trump tossed the ball to First Lady Melania Trump, who was seated in the audience.]\nOkay.\nSo let me just say that we have two thoughts. You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server. Why haven't they taken the server? Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that. I've been asking that for months and months, and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know: Where is the server? And what is the server saying?\nWith that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me—Dan Coats came to me and some others—they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia.\nI will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be, but I really do want to see the server. But I have—I have confidence in both parties. I really believe that this will probably go on for a while, but I don't think it can go on without finding out what happened to the server. What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing. Where are they? What happened to Hillary Clinton's e-mails? Thirty-three thousand e-mails gone—just gone. I think, in Russia, they wouldn't be gone so easily. I think it's a disgrace that we can't get Hillary Clinton's 33,000 e-mails.\nSo I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today. And what he did is an incredible offer; he offered to have the people working on the case come and work with their investigators with respect to the 12 people. I think that's an incredible offer.\nOkay? Thank you. Yes, please.\nAnd I have to say, if they had it, it would have been out long ago. And if anybody watched Peter Strzok testify over the last couple of days—and I was in Brussels watching it—it was a disgrace to the FBI, it was a disgrace to our country, and, you would say, that was a total witch hunt.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-russia-helsinki"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy", "Date": "2018-07-30", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm honored to welcome my new friend—we got along very well right from the beginning—Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to the White House.\nVery much.\nThank you, Giuseppe.\n[At this point, Prime Minister Conte spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nGood.\n[Prime Minister Conte spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThank you, Giuseppe. Thank you. Maybe we'll go with Saagar, please. Saagar Enjeti. Thank you. Daily Caller. Thank you.\nI'll always leave room for negotiation. But this has been many years; this isn't just Trump administration. We're new. This has been many years, even decades. We have immigration laws. We have border security. We have all sorts of things going on that are—it's disgraceful. We are doing a phenomenal job. We're setting records. But we have laws that don't work. So we're working around those laws, and it's unfortunate.\nI have to take my hat off to the Border Patrols, for the law enforcement, to ICE, which really has been maligned by the Democrats. The job they do, they go into these MS-13 nests, nests of bad, bad people, killers, in many cases. And they go in there fearless, and they do an incredible job. And they get them out. They either go to jail, or they get out of the country. So I want to just take my hat off to ICE and the brave people that have really been maligned by the Democrats.\nWe need border security. Without a border, as this gentleman can tell you also—because the Prime Minister really was—it was a very big factor in his win and other people's win in Italy—but it was a big factor in my win. We need border security. Border security includes the wall, but it includes many other things. We have to end the lottery. We have to end the chain. The chain is like a disaster. You bring one person in, and you end up with 32 people. We have to end these horrible catch-and-relief—release principles, where you catch somebody, you take their name, and you release them. You don't even know who they are. And then, they're supposed to come back to a court case, where they want us to hire thousands of judges. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we have to change our laws, and we do that through Congress.\nSo I would certainly be willing to close it down to get it done. As you know, we are already approving things in various bills, including, we're going to be taking care of the military. We always put the military and law enforcement very high. But I would be certainly willing to consider a shutdown if we don't get proper border security. Thank you.\nI have no red line, unlike President Obama. I just want great border security. Okay?\nWell, I can answer. The biggest thing Italy needs is great leadership, and they have it right now. I really, honestly, believe the Prime Minister is going to do a tremendous job on economic development, in addition to borders. You know, for economic development, you need borders also. But you have a man that's going to do a terrific job. I have no doubt about it at all.\nHe knows how to sell. He knows how to promote, really, a great product, because they make among the greatest products. I won't mention their names, but they are great. I have some of them. And Italy makes great product, and I think it's going to do very well economically. And we're there to help.\nWe have had record numbers. I've been here for a little more than a year and a half, and we've had record numbers. We've had record—we've had numbers that nobody believed possible, especially if you look at one particular fact that was not reported very much. Trade deficit—$52 billion reduction in the trade deficit for the quarter. And I think probably—Steve Mnuchin, Treasury, is here, and Mike Pompeo. I think nobody would have thought that would be possible so quickly. $52 billion reduction in the trade deficit for the quarter.\nI think that Italy is going to be able to do the same thing. Slightly different numbers, but the same thing.\nYou're asking me what?\nWell, that's up to them. I don't want to get involved in that. Look, the European Union—Jean-Claude and I had a fantastic meeting last week. We were having a hard time, and then I did mention tariffs on cars, and we got along very well. Very well. I think they're going to treat us very fairly, and we're going to treat them fairly. But as you know, it's been a one-way street. The European Union has totally taken advantage of the United States. We can't let that happen. Not fair to the United States.\nAnd by the way, Italy has a $31 billion surplus with the United States, meaning we have a $31 billion trade deficit with Italy. And we discussed that, and we'll work something out. We're going to work something out. Okay? Thank you.\nI do think this: One of the biggest things that we've done, obviously, the massive tax cuts, but maybe equal too would be the tremendous cuts in regulation. And I know Italy well, and they have a lot of regulation, and I have no doubt that the Prime Minister, Giuseppe, will be working very hard on that. But I think—Giuseppe, I can say from our standpoint—one of the most important things we did was cutting massively these horrible regulations. And I believe so strongly in the environment. I want the cleanest air, the cleanest water, the cleanest everything—the best everything. But you had 10 regulations for every point, in some cases. It was ridiculous. It would take many years to get a highway or a road approved. We have that way down. We have it down to 2 years, and it will, hopefully, be down to 1. And it may get rejected. But at least, it's going to go quickly.\nSo we want regulation, but it's got to be cut to a minimum and do the trick. And I think that Italy will follow suit. I know they've looked at it very strongly, and they're going to follow suit.\nOkay? Thank you. Thank you very much.\nRoberta Rampton of Reuters, please. Roberta. Hello, Roberta.\nI'll meet with anybody. I believe in meeting. The Prime Minister said it better than anybody can say it: Speaking to other people, especially when you're talking about potentials of war and death and famine and lots of other things, you meet. There's nothing wrong with meeting. We met, as you know, with Chairman Kim. And it—you haven't had a missile fired off in 9 months. We got our prisoners back. So many things have happened so positive.\nBut meeting with people—I had a great meeting, in my opinion. Of course, the fake news didn't cover it that way. But I had a great meeting with President Putin of Russia. I think it was a great meeting. In terms of the future, in terms of safety and economic development and protecting Israel and protecting everybody, I thought it was a great meeting.\nGreat meeting with NATO. I just explained NATO. Hundreds of billions of dollars more money will be paid into NATO, the coffers of NATO. And much already has.\nSo I believe in meeting. I would certainly meet with Iran if they wanted to meet. I don't know that they're ready yet. They're having a hard time right now. But I ended the Iran deal; it was a ridiculous deal. I do believe that they will probably end up wanting to meet, and I'm ready to meet any time they want to. And I don't do that from strength or from weakness. I think it's an appropriate thing to do. If we could work something out that's meaningful, not the waste of paper that the other deal was, I would certainly be willing to meet.\nNo preconditions. No. If they want to meet, I'll meet. Anytime they want. Anytime they want. It's good for the country, good for them, good for us, and good for the world. No preconditions. If they want to meet, I'll meet.Q.Prime Minister, I wanted to ask if you and the President—you talked about the need to stabilize Libya. I wanted to ask if you and the President discussed working together on energy production in Libya in some way. Did you discuss oil production in Libya? Do you see a way for the United States to become involved there, perhaps with Italy's help?\nThank you very much. Sanctions on Russia will remain as is.\nAs far as a pipeline is concerned, I'd like to see a competing pipeline. So, Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you're going to be able to do that competing pipeline. And we are already talking to the European Union about building anywhere from 9 to 11 ports, which they will pay for, so that we can ship our LNG over to various parts of Europe. And that will be more competition.\nBut the sanctions on Russia will remain as is.\nOkay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-giuseppe-conte-italy"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland", "Date": "2018-09-18", "Text": "Thank you very much. Please, sit down. Today I'm very honored to host the President of Poland, a friend of mine, President Duda, and Mrs. Duda. Thank you very much for being here. Great honor.\nIt's lovely to have you at the White House. We spent some time in the Oval Office, and we accomplished a lot. Melania and I are deeply grateful for the incredible welcome the President and Mrs. Duda gave us in Warsaw, Poland, last year. It was a very exceptional day. Extraordinary. It's wonderful to have them both with us in Washington today. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nDuring my visit last summer, I had the privilege to stand before the monument to the Warsaw Uprising and address the people of Poland about our shared commitment to defending our heritage and our civilization. It was an experience I will always treasure and I will never, ever forget.\nNot far from where we stand today, another monument in another square—the statue of General Kosciuszko in Lafayette Park—reminds us that the bonds between our people go all the way back to America's Revolutionary War.\nThis year, the United States and Poland are celebrating 100 years of Poland regaining its independence and nearly 100 years of U.S.-Polish diplomatic ties. It's a long time. I'm thrilled to say that the alliance between our nations has never been stronger with you and I at the helm. Do you agree with that?\nThank you, Mr. President. I'm glad he said yes. [Laughter]\nIn our discussions this afternoon, President Duda and I agreed to bolster our robust defense ties. We will enhance cooperation in military relations, intelligence, missile defense, technology, and training.\nI'm proud to report that Poland has recently purchased a state-of-the-art Patriot missile system, which is a great system. We make the greatest military equipment by far, anywhere in the world. And it's made right here in the USA.\nWe are grateful for Poland's leadership on defense spending and burden-sharing in NATO. I want to commend Poland for meeting its NATO defense-spending obligations, and I am glad that it plans to increase spending beyond the 2 percent minimum obligation. Thank you very much for that.\nI'd like to share my gratitude to the people of Poland for their contributions to NATO's Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan and the coalition to defeat ISIS. We've made tremendous progress with respect to the defeat of ISIS, as you've seen.\nWe also understand that you can't have national security without border security. Both Poland and the United States understand that strong nations must have very strong borders. The President and I likewise are exploring opportunities to advance energy security. The United States and Poland are deeply committed to energy diversity all across Europe. No nation should be dependent upon a single foreign supplier of energy.\nPoland has worked tirelessly to increase energy independence nationally and across Central Europe. It is constructing a new pipeline—the highest technology—from Norway to Poland, and it recently built a liquefied natural gas import facility. Last year, the United States was proud to send its first export of LNG to Poland, and soon, our nations will launch a high-level diplomatic exchange on energy security. And, Mr. President, we are now, as of a few months ago, the largest producer of energy in the world. So that was—that's a big statement.\nPresident Duda, I also just want to talk to you about the Three Seas Summit, where central European leaders were working hard to increase energy market access, reduce energy trade barriers—which is something we have to get done with respect to the European Union; the trade barriers, they make it very difficult for the United States—and to strengthen energy independence. The United States firmly supports these goals, and we are eager to expand commercial ties all across the region of Europe.\nIn our meeting today, the President and I discussed our bilateral economic relationship at length. Poland has experienced more than a quarter of century of uninterrupted economic growth, which is a very big statement; very few can say that. And we look forward to further enhancing trade, investment, and commerce between our two great nations.\nMy administration is committed to realizing a future of prosperity and opportunity for all Americans. This month, we celebrated the highest employment level in U.S. history. We are right now employing more people. We have more workers in the United States than at any time ever in U.S. history. I look forward to partnering with President Duda as we grow our economies together.\nThank you. A tremendous amount of LNG will be exported to Poland. We're giving them a pretty good price, but they're buying a lot of it, and that's going to be great.\nI do want to say that, while we're together, tremendous effort and bravery is being shown in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and the area that was so horribly hit by Hurricane Florence. I just got some clips of some of the things that the Coast Guard is doing and getting people to safety in horrible, horrible conditions.\nAnd I want to just salute all of the people that are working so hard: the first responders, law enforcement, the military, FEMA. The job they're doing is incredible. It's incredible. So I just want to thank them very much.\nAnd I think what we'll do is we'll take our first question from Emerald Robinson of One America News. Emerald?\nWell, I just heard about the incident you have mentioned, Emerald, and it sounds to me and it seems to me, just like based on a review of the facts, that Syria shot down a Russian plane. And I understand about 14 people were killed, at least. And that's a very sad thing. But that's what happens. But Syria—according to early reports; that's subject to change—but that Syria shot down a Russian plane. So that's not a good situation.\nWe have done a tremendous job in Syria and in that region eradicating ISIS, which is why we're there. And we're very close to being finished with that job, and then we're going to make a determination as to what we're going to do. But we have eradicated ISIS in a very large area of the Middle East. These are people that will not be coming here, because they're not around any longer. So we've done in a very short period of time.\nOur Vice President is here, Mike Pence. Our great Secretary of State—really, thank you very much for the great job you're doing—Mike Pompeo. And we've been working very hard on this. And they've done an incredible job over there, but we'll make a decision fairly quickly.\nThank you very much. Would you have a question for the President?\nAnd I think it should be pointed out that the President also said, and he also said it publicly, that he would pay the United States—meaning Poland would be paying billions of dollars for a base. And we're looking at that more and more from the standpoint of defending really wealthy countries and not being reimbursed, paid.\nIt's one thing when we defend countries that can't defend themselves and their great people. And we should help them; we don't expect anything for that. But when we're defending immensely wealthy countries and they're not paying for the defense to the United States, they're only taking advantage of us. And we are in discussions with numerous countries, all of whom you know, about payment. Payment. And we get along with them very well, but it's not fair. That includes NATO.\nAs you know, I got $44 billion additional last year, where they paid an additional—you can speak to Secretary General Stoltenberg, who is the head of NATO, and he said he's never seen anything like it. And this year we did even better.\nBut when a country is very wealthy, and when the United States has been protecting them for many years at tremendous cost—cost like nobody in this room would believe—it's time that they help with, we call it burden-sharing. And they will do that.\nBut the President offered us much more than $2 billion to do this, and so we're looking at it. We're looking at it from the standpoint of, number one, military protection for both countries, and also cost, a term you don't hear too often and you haven't heard too often over the last 25 years. But that's the way it has to be.\nThank you very much. Would you like to have a question, please?\nRussia/U.S. Military Strength\nI do. I actually do. I think it's a very aggressive situation. I think Russia has acted aggressively. They respect force. They respect strength, as anyone does. And we have the greatest strength in the world—especially now. We were being depleted under the last administration. We had planes that were old and tired and didn't fly, in some cases. They were getting used parts. This is the United States; it doesn't happen. We make the greatest planes in the world and missiles in the world.\nAnd we have enhanced, to put it mildly, our military. It's literally being rebuilt, as we speak, with literally hundreds and hundreds of planes and missiles, and everything that you can imagine. They never had it so good, because I got, in Congress, $700 billion this year; $716 billion last year. That's far more than they ever anticipated.\nI viewed it two ways. Number one, military—because it's always more important than anything else, including jobs. But number two is jobs. We make everything here. So it's hundreds of thousands of jobs to make for us the best military in the world. And Russia respects that. They respect that. So I am with the President. I feel that he's right. And I feel that, look, you look at the history of Poland and Russia, that's a long and very complicated history. So he certainly has a right to feel that way. Okay?\nJon Decker of Fox, please.\nIt wouldn't bother me, other than the FBI, Jon, said that they really don't do that; that's not what they do. Now, they have done, supposedly, six background checks over the years, as Judge Kavanaugh has gone beautifully up a ladder. He's an incredible individual. Great intellect, great judge. Impeccable history in every way—in every way.\nI feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you. I feel so badly for him. This is not a man that deserves this. This should have been brought to the fore. It should have been brought up long ago. And that's what you have hearings for. You don't wait until the hearing is over and then, all of a sudden, bring it up.\nWhen Senator Feinstein sat with Judge Kavanaugh for a long period of time—a long, long meeting—she had this letter. Why didn't she bring it up? Why didn't she bring it up then? Why didn't the Democrats bring it up then? Because they obstruct and because they resist. That's the name of their campaign against me. They just resist, and they just obstruct. And frankly, I think they're lousy on policy, and in many ways, they're lousy politicians. But they're very good on obstruction. And it's a shame, because this is a great gentleman.\nWith all of that, I feel that the Republicans—and I can speak for myself—we should go through a process, because there shouldn't even be a little doubt. There shouldn't be a doubt. Again, they knew what they were doing. They should have done this a long time ago—3 months ago—not now. But they did it now. So I don't want to play into their hands.\nHopefully, the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then, they will vote. They will look at his career. They will look at what she had to say from 36 years ago. And we will see what happens.\nBut I just think he is at a level that we rarely see not only in government, anywhere in life. And honestly, I feel terribly for him, for his wife, who is an incredible, lovely woman, and for his beautiful young daughters. I feel terribly for them.\nWell, we just started. We didn't do anything with respect to China because we wanted to have the benefit of China having to do with North Korea. And they have been helpful. I hope they're still helpful; there's a question about that. But it got to a point where the numbers were too big. This should have been done for the last 20 years.\nIf you look at the WTO, the World Trade Organization, that's when China really happened, economically. That's—it was like a rocket ship, because they took advantage of the rules of the WTO.\nAnd whoever was standing at this podium in this incredible White House, in the Oval Office, they should have done something about this long ago.\nOver the last number of years, China has taken out of this country $500 billion and more—a year. $500 billion. That would go a long way for Poland, wouldn't it? You could rebuild your whole country. And that's what China did. They rebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States. And I've changed that around. And if you look at what's going on, our market is going up like a rocket ship. I don't want their market to go down, but their market is down 32 percent in 3 months. Because we can't let them do anymore what they've done.\nAnd I watch trade deficits, because to me, deficits are very important. They're not everything, and they're not exact. Sometimes, you can have, you know, a deficit, and that's not such a bad thing. But when you have $375 billion in trade deficits and then many billions of dollars in other liabilities of all different types, you have to do something about it.\nWe are the piggybank to the world. We have been ripped off by China. We've been ripped off by—excuse me, Mr. President—the European Union, of which you're a part of. [Laughter] We've been ripped off by everybody. And I want to protect the American worker, the American farmer, the ranchers, the companies. And we're not being ripped off, you will see, in a little while.\nSpeaking of that, we've come to a conclusion with Mexico. We have a wonderful deal for both parties. It was a very one-sided deal. Now it's a good deal for both parties. Very happy with it.\nThe new President had conversation and it was terrific. I think we're going to have a very good relationship. We'll see. We'll see. We want help on the border because we have the worst immigration laws in the history of mankind or womankind. We have horrible, horrible immigration laws, so we want help. But we've come to a conclusion with Mexico. Canada has taken advantage of our country for a long time. We love Canada. We love it. Love the people of Canada. But they are in a position that's not a good position for Canada. They cannot continue to charge us 300-percent tariff on dairy products, and that's what they're doing.\nSo this is a process. It takes a little time. The European Union wouldn't talk to us. They wouldn't talk to President Obama. Wouldn't even talk to him. And then I said, \"That's okay, you don't have to talk to me.\" Jean-Claude is a tough man. He's a very good man. I like him, but he's tough. He's nasty. [Laughter] The kind of guy I want negotiating for me. But he's a tough, tough cookie. And I said to him, \"We have to renegotiate the deal.\" He said: \"But, Mr. President, we are very happy with the deal. We don't want to negotiate.\" I said, \"You may be happy with the deal, but I'm not happy with the deal.\nAnd he didn't want to renegotiate. And after three times, he still didn't want to renegotiate. I said, \"That's okay, we don't have to renegotiate any longer. We're going to put a tariff on all of the millions of cars you send into the United States.\" And honestly, he was in my office so quickly, from Europe, that I didn't know they had airplanes that flew that fast. [Laughter] I said, \"Where did you find this plane?\" [Laughter]\nAnd we have the semblance of a deal. Because it's, to a large extent, economically all about cars. Cars are a very big factor. And they send millions of BMWs and Mercedes into our country.\nSo we are working on trade very hard. It's very important to me. It has been for 30 years. I've been saying for 30 years. It started with Japan. I talked about Japan; I was right. I talked about China; I was right. It's what I do. And I like doing it. But I like doing it for the people because our country has been abused and taken advantage of by virtually every country that it does business with. And we're just not letting that happen anymore. And that includes what I said previously about the military.\nThe trade deal with South Korea has been fully renegotiated and is ready for signature. We may sign it at the United Nations or shortly thereafter. That was a terrible deal for the United States. Now it's a fair deal. But that's been fully renegotiated, in addition to Mexico and some of the others that are very close.\nThank you very much, everybody. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-andrzej-duda-poland"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in New York City", "Date": "2018-09-26", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. We've had a great 3 days at the United Nations in New York. And this is quite a gathering. Wow. It's a lot of people, a lot of media. [Laughter]\nWe've covered a great deal of territory. Just left, as you know, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. We're starting trade talks with Japan. They were not willing, for years, to talk trade, and now they're willing to talk trade. And I'm sure we'll make a very good deal.\nJust concluded, as you know—2 days ago, signed a deal with South Korea—a trade deal, a tremendous deal with South Korea. It means a lot of business for our farmers. We're opening up for farmers. We're opening up for a lot of different groups.\nWe're going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before. And so we're very happy with that. That deal is actually concluded.\nWe're very well along the way with Mexico. The relationship is very good. And with Canada, we'll see what happens. They're charging us 300-percent tariffs on dairy products. We can't have that. We can't have that.\nWith China, as you know, we put out an announcement today. They would like to see me lose an election, because they've never been challenged like this. But I want to open up China to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies. And China is not open, but we're open to them. They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing in terms of coming into the country. Cars, they're at 25 percent. And we're at 2 percent and 2½ percent and don't even collect it. But we collect it now.\nSo we're doing very well in our situation with China on trade. I have a great relationship with the President of China, President Xi. But it's got to be a two-way street. It—for 25 years and longer, it was not. And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China. We just can't have that. We have to make it fair.\nSo we're at $250 billion now at 25-percent interest. And a lot of money is coming into our coffers. And it's had no impact on our—absolutely, by the way—no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn't.\nIn fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is. If you look at what happened with steel, we're charging a 25-percent tariff for the dumpers. They dump massive amounts of steel. They want to put the steel companies out of business. And after they're out of business, they'll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible. And we need steel, and we need aluminum. And those industries are doing well.\nBut steel is incredible. U.S. Steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants. Nucor is opening up plants. And these are big plants—$750-million and a billion-dollar plants, in some cases.\nSo what's happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me. It's being rebuilt overnight. If you look at the miners in coal, if you look at energy, LNG—Japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible. They're doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for Japan. They're taking the LNG, and they're doubling it up.\nI said: \"You have to do me a favor. We don't want these big deficits. You're going to have to buy more.\" They're buying massive amounts of equipment and military equipment, and other countries are doing the same thing. Because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody. It's a rare exception that we don't.\nSo we are doing great as a country. Unfortunately, they just raised interest rates a little bit, because we are doing so well. I'm not happy about that, because I know it's going to be a question. I am not happy about that. I'd rather pay down debt or do other things, create more jobs. So I'm worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates. We can do other things with the money. And—but they raised them. And they're raising them because we're doing so well. You know, we're doing much better than I had projected in terms of—when I was campaigning, I said we were going to do this, and we're doing much better than anybody ever thought possible.\nAnd I will say, if others got in, it would have been just the opposite, because they were going to put restrictions on. They were going to put regulations on. They were going to choke the economy as it was already choking, but it would have been worse. And they were going to raise your taxes. That's what they want to do now if they ever got control, which I don't think they'll have control for a long time.\nSo with that being said, we'll take some questions and—yes, please. John [John Roberts, Fox News], go ahead. We have plenty of time.\nSenate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nYes.\nRight. Right.\nWell, the FBI told us they've investigated Judge Kavanaugh six times, five times, many times over the years. They know him very well. But here, there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint. They didn't know the location. They didn't know the time. They didn't know the year. They didn't know anything. And it's like, where do you go?\nAlso, it's not for the FBI. If you look at what Joe Biden said, he said, \"They don't do this.\" And he said it very clearly. So I think when you really look at it all, it's not going to change any of the Democrats' minds. They're obstructionists. They're actually con artists, because they know how quality this man is, and they've destroyed a man's reputation and they want to destroy it even more.\nAnd I think people are going to see that in the midterms. What they've done to this family, what they've done to these children—these beautiful children of his—and what they've done to his wife. And they know it's a big, fat con job. And they go into a room, and I guarantee you, they laugh like hell at what they've pulled off on you and on the public. They laugh like hell.\nSo, it wouldn't have mattered if the FBI came back with the cleanest score. And you understand that very well, John. If they would have come back with the most perfect—\"We found everything, and he's perfectly innocent of everything.\" It wouldn't have made a difference. You wouldn't have gotten one vote.\nNow we will get votes from the Democrats if we win. You'll have three, four, or five Democrats giving us votes, because they're in States that I won by 30 and 40 points, and they're going to give us votes. But other than that, you probably won't get any, John.\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nSenate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nYes.\nI won't get into that game. I'll only tell you this: This is one of the highest quality people that I've ever met, and everybody that knows him says the same thing. And these are all false—to me, these are false accusations in certain cases. And certain cases, even the media agrees with that.\nI can only say that, what they've done to this man is incredible. You know, it's very interesting, I pick a lot of judges. I have 145 judges I will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because President Obama wasn't big on picking judges. When I got there, I said, \"How is this possible?\" I have 145—including Court of Appeals—judges. And they just didn't do it. You know why? They got tired. They got complacent. Something happened. I have 145 judges.\nEverybody wants to be a Federal judge. Not just a Supreme Court judge, I'm talking about Court of Appeals; I'm talking about District Court. I don't think they're going to want to so much. I'll be calling people, and we'll have people calling people that do this. And people are going to be scared because we could say it about you, \"Thirty-five years ago, you met someone . . .\"—and you might know—you might not know what's going on.\nWhat is going on? Why did they wait so long? Why did Senator Feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case? Why didn't she bring it right at the beginning? When you ask about, as an example, the FBI, why didn't they bring this right at the beginning, during the hearing? You would have had all the time in the world for the FBI. It would have been fine. Now the FBI, as you know, did investigate this time, as they have five or six other times. And they did a very thorough investigation. But this is a big con job. And I would love to be in the room with the Democrats, close the door—you guys are all away, outside, waiting—and Schumer and his buddies are all in there laughing how they fooled you all. Let's just stop them. A big fat con.\nYeah, go ahead.\nBy the way, I only say this: 36 years, no charge, no nothing. Everybody——\nPeople are going to have to make a decision. Thirty-six years, there's no charge. All of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out.\nAnd then you have this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today. I only say that you have to look at the facts. The Senators are very capable people. They're very good people. I know many of them. They're friends of mine. These are very talented, very good people. And they're going to vote. They're going to believe what they believe.\nI can—when I look at what's happened to the reputation of a great gentleman—a great intellect; a brilliant man; somebody that has a chance to be one of our great Supreme Court Justices in history, intellectually—I think it's a shame.\nYes, please.\nOkay.\nI've been very proactive against Cuba. I don't like what's happening in Cuba. As you know, President Obama gave them a pass, and I didn't like it. Neither do Cuban people based in Miami and based in our country that came from Cuba and suffered in Cuba.\nI don't like what he did. I've ended much of it, most of it. I don't like what's happening in Cuba, and I certainly don't like what's happening in Venezuela.\nYes, please.\nGo ahead.\nSocialism/VenezuelaQ.Mr. President, just to finish really fast. You said also that you had a call to action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism. Would you like to be recognized as the President——\nWell, I wouldn't say that socialism has been working really well around the world, okay. You can take a look at Venezuela as your number one—your number one—I guess, the one that is most obvious. But you take a look around the world, socialism is not exactly riding high.\nGo ahead.\nWhat does he mean by that? Explain. [Laughter] What does that mean?\nWhat does it mean? No, what does it mean?\nI wouldn't mind that at all. No. Wouldn't mind it at all.\nWouldn't make any difference to me.\nGo ahead.\n2017 Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy S. Moore/Sexual Assault\nWell, first of all, I wasn't happy with Roy Moore. Let's get that straight. But Roy Moore was a Republican candidate——\n——and I would have rather had a Republican candidate win. I was very happy with Luther Strange, who was a terrific man from Alabama, but Luther Strange had a lot of things going against him. As far as women, whether it's a man or a woman, these are—you know, it can happen the other way. Allegations can go the other way also. You understand that. And whether it was a man or a woman, 30 years ago, 36 years ago—in fact, they don't even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is—that's a long time.\nAnd I could pick, as an example—hopefully, I won't have to do it as a replacement, because hopefully, this is going to go very well on Thursday. It's going to go very well on Monday or Saturday or Sunday or whenever they vote. But I could pick a woman, and she could have charges made from many years ago also.\nI don't think people are reluctant to come forward. They're going to have a chance to speak at a major—they have a major chance to speak.\nExcuse me. Excuse me. They have a major chance to speak. And it will be tomorrow, I assume. We've delayed this—meaning the Republican Senators, not me. The Republicans Senators have delayed this for weeks now. They're giving the women a major chance to speak.\nNow, it's possible I'll hear that, and I'll say, \"Hey, I'm changing my mind.\" That is possible. We want to give them a chance to speak. And they're given——\nWell, whoever is given a chance. We've delayed it a long time. But they're going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case. And you know what? I could be persuaded also. Okay?\nYes. Please. Please, go ahead. Go ahead. I would like to go—yes, go ahead. Please.\nThank you.\nI can't tell you. I have to watch tomorrow. I have to read. I just heard about one a little while ago. I can tell you her lawyer is a low life, okay? So I can't tell you whether or not they're liars until I hear them.\nI don't know what happened today because I've been very busy with Japan, with South Korea, with China, and about seven other countries, as you know, and I chaired the Security Council. So I don't know about today's person that came forward. I do know about the lawyer. And you don't get much worse, bad reputation too. Take a look at his past.\nSo, as far as the other women are concerned, I'm going to see what happens tomorrow. I'm going to be watching—you know, believe it or not. I'm going to see what's said. It's possible that they will be convincing.\nNow, with all of that being said, Judge Brett Kavanaugh has been, for many years, one of the most respected people in Washington. He's been on, I guess you'd call it, the second highest court. And every single person knows him; a lot of people know him well. And those people don't believe what's going on. I can always be convinced. I have to hear it.\nSenate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nIf I thought he was guilty of something like this, yes, sure.\nI want to watch. I want to see. I hope I can watch. I'm meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow, but I will certainly, in some form, be able to watch. And I'll also rely on some very fair and talented Republican Senators who—look, if we brought George Washington here and we said, \"We have George Washington,\" the Democrats would vote against him, just so you understand. [Laughter]\nAnd he may have had a bad past, who knows, you know. [Laughter] He may have had some, I think, accusations made. Didn't he have a couple of things in his past? George Washington would be voted against 100 percent by Schumer and the con artists. I mean, 100 percent. One hundred percent.\nSo it really doesn't matter from their standpoint. That's why when John asked about the FBI. If the FBI did the most thorough investigation in the history of the FBI and they found him to be 100-percent perfect, he would lose every single vote.\nNow, if the Republicans win tomorrow, I think you're going to get some votes from the Democrats. You know why? Because—we all know why—because it's called politics. Then, you'll probably get some votes.\nOkay, let's go.\nShe stands up: \"I'd like to ask about three questions.\" It's not really fair to everyone else.\nShould I let her ask another question?\n[At this point, several reporters shouted questions.]\nGo ahead. See?\nIt's not a benefit of the doubt. I've——\nI've known them. Hallie [Hallie Jackson, NBC News], I've know them for a long time and—a lot of these people. A lot of people. And some I've been disappointed with. I have been disappointed with some. Others, like—you know, there are charges that are pretty weak.\nBut I've known people for a long time. I never saw them do anything wrong. I never saw them do anything wrong. And there are some that probably—I agree. I can tell you there are some that I—I've been watching for a long time. And in a couple of cases, they weren't Republicans. In a lot of cases, they were not; they were exactly the opposite.\nBut I've been watching them for a long time. And I knew for a long time these were not good people. And they were never brought up.\nThank you.\nI do.\nI wish it could have gone quicker.Q.Well, you also said that if what she said were as bad as she claims, surely, her or her parents would have reported it. And just today you said you wouldn't——\nWell, there is a truth. I mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported it 36 years ago.\nIt doesn't mean they had to report it, because in some instances, people keep it quiet. It's a very tough situation for a woman, there's no question about it. And in some cases, they do report it. Frankly, had they reported it, it would've been pretty amazing, wouldn't it?\nBut I guess they didn't, and that's okay. I'm not saying they had to report it, because it's a very personal thing. It's a very big problem, there's no question about it.\nGo ahead.\nSenate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nI'd like to hear her story, yes. Well, we're giving her a time.\nThey would've given her time last week. This is the United States Senate. This is the most important position that a President can give out, I think we can say, by far. I've actually heard it's the most important decision a President can make. I disagree with that. War and peace—I always say \"war and peace\"—and after that, Supreme Court Justice. Right?\nI look forward to hearing from her. We could've heard from her last week; we could have heard from her for a long time. It will be interesting to hear what she has to say. Okay?\nWhich one? Which question? Who?\nI've been accused. I've been accused. False accusations.\nExcuse me. I've been accused. And I was accused by—I believe, it was—four women. You can check with Sean Hannity. You can check with Fox, because they covered it very strongly—who got paid.\nExcuse me. Excuse me. I was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me. We caught them, and the mainstream media refused to put it on television. They refused to even write about it. There were four women and maybe more; I think the number is four or five. But one had a mortgage paid off her house, $52,000. Another one had other things happen. And the one that reported it, I believe, was offered $750,000 to say bad things about me, and she is the one that reported it. This woman is incredible. She reported it, instead of taking the money.\nSo I've had numerous accusations about me.\nI mean, they made false statements about me, knowing they were false. I never met them. I never met these people. And what did they do? What did they do?\nThey took money in order to say bad things. I've had stories written in the New York Times—front page—about four women. The whole top center front page of the New York Times. I think it was four big pictures.\nI said: \"Wow. That's a big thing. What's that?\" These were women that were quoted saying bad things about me. Not the worst things about me, but bad things. And I said, \"Gee, that's too bad.\" I knew them a long time ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago. I said: \"That's too bad. I'm surprised at them.\"\nAnd then, all of a sudden, I see them on television, nothing to do with me. The next day or a day later, they were incensed. They said: \"Donald Trump is a nice guy. We never said this. The New York Times did false reporting. They're fake news.\" And you know what? The New York Times would not report that their story was fake.\nThese women said great things. Not only did they not say the bad stuff, they said great things about me. Front page. And those women—they're incredible women—they went on television—and they didn't want to, and I didn't ask them. And they said: \"The New York Times made it up. They gave false quotes.\" And they went on a lot of shows. They were really incensed, and they couldn't believe it.\nThat's why people know that a lot of the news is fake. And a lot of the people sitting here are fake. But 20 percent of them are wonderful. Okay?\nSexual Assault Allegations Against the President and Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nYou've been asking a question for 10 minutes, all right?\nPlease sit down. Please.\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, it does impact my opinion. You know why? Because I've had a lot of false charges made against me. I'm a very famous person, unfortunately. I've been a famous person for a long time. But I've had a lot of false charges made against me, really false charges. I know friends that have had false charges. People want fame. They want money. They want whatever. So when I see it, I view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television, where they say, \"Oh, Judge Kavanaugh . . .\" this or that.\nIt's happened to me many times. I've had many false charges; I had a woman sitting in an airplane, and I attacked her while people were coming onto the plane. And I have a number-one bestseller out? I mean it was total phony story. There are many of them.\nSo when you say, does it affect me in terms of my thinking with respect to Judge Kavanaugh? Absolutely. Because I've had it many times.\nAnd if the news would have reported these four people—I couldn't believe it. When I heard that they caught these four people, I said: \"Wow. That's a big story.\" And it was—for Fox. Okay.\nI did.\nThat's right. That's what I hear.\nThat's what I hear.\nWe have evidence. We have evidence. It will come out.\nYes, I can't tell you now, but it came—it didn't come out of nowhere that I can tell you.\nNow, if you—they've actually admitted that they're going after farmers. I mean, I think most of you can cover that.\nI like that you're shaking your head, \"yes.\" I'm going to ask you the next question because of that. Okay? It's probably going to be the killer of all questions. [Laughter] But let me just explain——\nChina-U.S. Relations/U.S. Economy/Interest Rates\nNo, no, no. Let me——\nChina, now, put on $250 billion, and they're paying 25 percent on that. They're paying billions and billions. This has never happened to China. And I like China, and I like President Xi a lot. I think he's a friend of mine. He may not be a friend of mine anymore, but he—I think he probably respects—— From what I hear—if you look at Mr. Pillsbury, the leading authority on China—he was on a good show—I won't mention the name of the show—recently. And he was saying that China has total respect for Donald Trump and for Donald Trump's very, very large brain. He said, \"Donald—Donald Trump.\" [Laughter] \"They don't know what to do.\" It never happened.\nWell, one thing they are trying to do is, they are trying to convince people to go against Donald Trump. Because a normal, regular, political person that has no concept of what the hell he's doing would let China continue to take $500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country. I mean, they were building 29 massive bridges like the George Washington Bridge. They're building things that we don't build anymore. But we're starting to build them again.\nAnd our economy now is hotter than it's ever been. I don't know you if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came out. Fantastic.\nAnd in all fairness to the Fed raising rates, they're raising rates because we've never done like we're doing now. And one of the things that is nice about the rates: the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and, you know—when President Obama had an economy that was—it was the worst comeback since the Great Depression and all that—you've all heard that. But remember, he was playing with zero-interest money. He was playing with funny money. That's easy. I'm playing with fairly expensive money.\nSo when he does that, the people that benefit are people that actually—in their whole life, they would save 10, 15, 20 percent of their salary and put it in the bank. Those people got killed because they put their money in the bank. They were going to live off the interest, and there was no interest.\nNow, those people are starting to get interest. And those are the people, frankly, that deserve to—you know, they did a great job. The people that did it right, the people that did the best job, got hurt the most. So in one sense I like it, but basically, I'm a low-interest-rate person, I hate to tell you.\nYes. Yes, ma'am. Yes. Yes, go ahead.\nYes.\nI'm talking to him. We've had a good talk. He said he never said it. He said he doesn't believe it. He said he has a lot of respect for me, and he was very nice, and we'll see. And he's a member of the Trump administration, in that sense; it's the Justice Department.\nI would certainly prefer not doing that. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction—I mean, unless you call obstruction the fact that I fight back. I do fight back. I really fight back. I mean, if you call that obstruction, that's fine.\nBut there's no obstruction. There's no collusion. I'm going to meet with him tomorrow. I may call Rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting, because I don't want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important Supreme Court pick. So I don't want it competing and hurting the decision—one way or the other decision. Again, I want to hear what she has to say.\nBut I want to do—so I may delay that. I'm going to see. I don't want to do anything that's going to conflict with that. But my preference would be to keep him and to let him finish up.\nYou know, I call it a \"witch hunt.\" And it is a witch hunt. If you look at the FBI statements with Strzok and his lover Lisa Page. If you look at all of the things that have gone on in the FBI. If you look at McCabe taking $700,000 from a Hillary Clinton PAC, essentially run by Terry McAuliffe, who's her best friend in the world, and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he's in charge of her campaign, and his wife is getting all of this money to run—she lost—to run. [Laughter] I mean, what's going on?\nIf you look at the horrible statements, like: \"Way to go, Page. Great story you put into a newspaper. Essentially, now we'll go and investigate that group.\" It's terrible. We have caught people doing things that are terrible. I would much prefer keeping Rod Rosenstein. Much prefer. Many people say I have the right to absolutely fire him. He said he did not say it. He said he does not believe that. And nobody in this room believes it.\nBy the way, I deal with the people in this room. I was with Mike Pompeo before, and we were dealing, at a very high level, with Japan. And I was saying things that nobody in the room even understood. And I said them a long time ago, and I was right. He said, \"That's not the 25th Amendment that I'm looking at.\" I think I can say that from Mike.\nI don't think so. Well, yes—enemies, sure. You use anything you can.\nHey, you use anything they can. They're not in love with me. They're not going to beat me in the election; they know that. They're not going to beat me. The people that I'm looking at are total lightweights. I dream of running against those people.\nMaybe they'll come up with somebody that's not—they're not going to beat me. I'm against what they want to do. I'm in favor of law enforcement. I'm in favor of safety and security and low taxes. I want low taxes.\nI want borders. We're getting another $1.6 billion in borders. I want borders. We've spent $3.2 [billion; White House correction.], and we're getting another $1.6 [billion; White House correction.]. And then eventually, we're getting the whole thing and we'll complete the wall.\nThey don't want that. They don't want that. They don't want the things that I have.\nNow, I must say, I know many of the Democrats. They'll say things and then wink at me. And again, it's the same old story. They'll say things; they don't mean it. It's politics. The reason they don't want me is because they want to run the show. They want it. It's power. It's whatever you want to call it. But what they've done here is a disgrace, a total disgrace.\nAnd what they do—I know, it's sort of interesting—in one case, they say: \"He's a fascist. He's taking over the Government. He's the most powerful President ever. He's a horrible human being. He wants to take over the entire Government, and he's going to do it. We can't stop him.\" That didn't work.\nThe next week, he said, \"Uh, he's incompetent.\" I said, \"Well, wait a minute.\" In one case, I'm taking over the world. [Laughter] And in the other case, \"He's incompetent.\" They tried that for a week; that didn't work.\nLook, these are very dishonest people. These are con artists. And the press knows it, but the press doesn't write it.\n[At this point, many reporters began speaking at once.]\nGo ahead. Give it to me. Give it to me, Steve. Reuters.\nBecause he'd like it.\nSo I've received two letters from Chairman Kim. At some point, I'll, you know, give these letters; they're incredible letters. They're letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done. I really believe he wants to get it done. I may be wrong.\nI heard somebody on a certain network last night—I won't mention which one—say, \"Why has President Trump given so much to North Korea?\" I said, \"Wait a minute.\" I asked Sarah Huckabee, \"Please call this person.\" I gave nothing; other than I met. What did I give them?\nI didn't do what Obama did: Give them $1.8 billion in cash to get back four hostages. I got back our hostages; I never paid them anything. I haven't paid them 10 cents.\nBut he wants to make a deal, and I'd like to make a deal. We actually have a very good relationship together, a lot different than the last time I was at the United Nations. That was a little bit rough.\nDon't forget, that time, they said: \"Oh, Trump is saying these horrible things. He's going to get us into a war.\" You were going to have a war. If I wasn't elected, you'd be in war. And President Obama essentially said the same thing. He was ready to go to war.\nYou would have had a war, and you would have lost millions, not thousands. You would have lost millions of people. Seoul has 30 million people, 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border. If I wasn't elected, you would have had a war. President Obama thought you had to go to war. You know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war? Millions of people. With me, nobody is talking about that. Nobody is talking about that.\nWe have a very good relationship. He likes me. I like him. We get along. He wrote me two of the most beautiful letters. When I showed one of the letters—just one—to Prime Minister Abe, he said: \"This is actually a groundbreaking letter. This is an incredible—this is a historic letter.\" And it is a historic letter. It's a beautiful piece of art. And I think we're going to make a deal.\nWill we make a deal, Steve? I don't really know. But I think we're going to. In the meantime—and I've said it a—I don't want to bore you: no rockets, no missiles, no nuclear tests. You know, for over a year, where you haven't seen.\nBefore I got here, everybody in this room thought you were going to war. And then, what happened—it was funny—they said: \"He was terrible. He was so rough with Chairman Kim—Kim Jong Un. He was so rough. It's terrible. He's going to cause\"—well, I had a great meeting with President Putin. And on that one, they said, \"He was too soft with President Putin.\" I had a great meeting with the President. It lasted for 2 hours. We discussed everything: Ukraine, Syria, Israel and Israel's protection. We had a great meeting. They wanted me to end up in a boxing match.\nAnd you know what? If I was killer-tough with President Putin, they would have said, \"He was too tough.\" You can't win with these people, but you just keep going. In the meantime, we're doing well.\nGo ahead.\nWait. One second.\nI don't know. I don't want to get into——\nSteve, I don't want to get into the time game. You know why? I told Mike Pompeo, I said, \"Mike, don't get into the time game.\" We stopped them. They're taking down plants. They're taking down a lot of different testing areas. They're going to take down some more. You'll be hearing about that very soon. I don't want to go ahead of myself, but you'll be hearing about it soon. They have no interest right now in testing nuclear.\nYou know, we had a case just about when I was coming into office—you all remember it—where there was a massive—they thought it was an earthquake. A mountain moved over an inch and a half. We're talking about mountains. You know, North Korea is very mountainous. Beautiful land. Beautiful. This mountain actually shifted. It shifted. And somebody thought it was an earthquake. And then, they found out, no, this was nuclear testing. Shifted a mountain. Now I'm talking about serious stuff, serious size.\nWhen I came in, and certainly before I came in—and even at the beginning of mine, because when I was having rhetorical contests—you know, contests, really, I guess you could call it—with Chairman Kim, which we both smile at now and we laugh at. But everybody thought that was a horrible thing.\nWe've had many Presidents who were unable to do anything, anything at all with North Korea. We now have a good relationship. We have a good relationship. And most importantly, all of the things that you've been hearing about—the horror stories—in my opinion, they're gone.\nNow, could they start up again? Yes. I'm a deal guy. Could they start? Yes. Could be that we don't work it out. I think—I have it right here—I think that what we've done behind the scenes, which nobody really knows about—and I don't blame you for not knowing about, you know, personal letters, private letters. But saying they want to get it done. We know much more than the media for a change. Much more. But if you saw what's going on behind the scenes, I think you'd very impressed.\nWe were a country going to war. I really believe that President Obama would admit that he said it's by far his biggest problem. When I sat with him, prior to going to office—going into office, he said to me that's by far the biggest problem. And he said to me that he was very close to going into war.\nAnd millions of people—not—you know, I—they say, \"Oh, thousands of people . . .\" No, no, no, not thousands. Millions of people would have been killed. And that could have left—you're right next to China; you're right—that could have been a world war very easily.\nRight now we're in a great position. I don't want to play the time game. I told Mike Pompeo, \"Don't let them do that to you.\" I haven't given anything. And all of a sudden—we got back, it was a few weeks ago. I think we were back, like, 2½ months from the summit, which was a great success. And people are screaming, \"What's taking so long?\" I said, \"Oh, I get it.\" You've got to understand the media. I've been dealing with the media all my life. Too much. Too much.\nThey're screaming, and I saw that. And our guys were—and not Mike—but our guys were being, \"Oh well, we're working as fast . . .\" I said: \"I've got all the time in the world. I don't have to rush it.\" There's no—you know, secession of sanctions. We've got the sanctions on. I didn't take any sanctions off.\nI did see a reporter last night—a guy I like, personally, a lot—and he asked a question to President Moon of South Korea. He said, \"Why did the President give so much?\" I didn't give anything. I gave nothing. What have I given, other than some time? Yes, I flew to Singapore. We had a meeting.\nNow, giving would be if I took the sanctions off. I didn't want to do—if you asked General Mattis, for a year and a half, I said, \"Why don't we stop these ridiculous,\" in my opinion, \"the military games?\" I call them the \"military games.\" If I told you how much those games cost—and frankly, I told South Korea, \"You should be paying for these games.\" We pay for them.\nThey say, \"Well, we fly the planes in from a short distance away.\" I said, \"Where is that?\" \"Guam.\" \"Oh, huh. How long a trip is that?\" \"Seven hours.\" \"Oh, great.\" We're flying these massive bombers and everything. I've wanted to stop this for a long time. I consider that an asset.\nBut we've done—we're saving, by the way—just for the taxpayer, we're saving a fortune. And if we need them, we can start them up immediately. If I think we need them, I'll start them before the generals will start them. The fact is, this reporter said that. I said: \"What have we done? I haven't given anything.\" And we're really onto the cusp. I think we're really going to do something that's going to be very important.\nBut we're not playing the time game. If it takes 2 years, 3 years, or 5 months, it doesn't matter. There's no nuclear testing, and there's no testing of rockets.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead. Go ahead. Please.\nThis is the one that was nodding with every nice thing I said, so watch this question.\nYou're with who?\nOkay, good. Sky News.\nCongratulations on the purchase. [Laughter]\nI hope you benefited. [Laughter] Go ahead.\nOh, I've used much worse language in my life than \"con job.\" That's, like, probably the nicest phrase I've ever used. I mean, con job—it is. It's a con job. You know, confidence—it's a confidence job, but they shorten—it's a con job by the Democrats. They know it.\nThey did the same thing with the Russia investigation. They tried to convince people that I had something to do with Russia. There was no collusion.\nThink of it. I'm in Wisconsin. I'm in Michigan. I say, \"Gee, we're not doing well.\" I won both those States. \"We're not doing well. Uh, let me call the Russians to help.\" Does anybody really believe that? It's a con job.\nAnd I watch these guys, Little Adam Schiff and all of the guys. He takes a call from a Russian who turned out to be a faker. You know, he was a comedian or something. \"This is so-and-so calling for . . .\"—he took the call. Why is the taking a call from a Russian? Senator Warner took a call from a Russian. He was a comedian or something, but he said, \"We have pictures of President Trump.\" \"Oh, where can I get them?\" If we ever did that, it would be, like, a big deal.\nYes, it's a con job. And it's not a bad term. It's not a bad term at all.\nI'll tell you one thing I can say: I've had a lot of people talking about this to me, with respect to what's happening, because it's a horrible precedent.\nI'm going to have to get other judges and other Supreme Court judges, possibly. I could have a lot of the Supreme Court judges, more than two. And when I called up Brett Kavanaugh—spoke to him and his family—and told them that I chose them, they were so happy and so honored. It was as though—I mean, the biggest thing that's ever happened. And I understand that: U.S. Supreme Court.\nI don't want to be in a position where people say: \"No, thanks. No, thanks. I don't want to—you know, I spoke to somebody 38 years ago, and it may not be good.\" We have a country to run. We want the best talent in the world.\nBut I'll tell you this: The people that have complained to me about it the most—about what's happening—are women. Women are very angry.\nYou know, I got 52 percent with women. Everyone said, \"This couldn't happen—52 percent.\" Women are so angry. And I, frankly, think that—I think they like what the Republicans are doing, but I think they would have liked to have seen it go a lot faster. But give them their day in court. Let her have her day in court. Let somebody else have a day in court.\nBut the ones that I find—I mean, I have men that don't like it, but I have women that are incensed at what's going on. I've always said women are smarter than men. I've said that a lot, and I mean it. But women are incensed at what's going on.\nYes, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, in the back.\nWho are you? Or where are you from?\nYes, you. [Laughter] The guy looks—the guy looks like he's shocked. That's not—this is going to be not good. [Laughter]\nThe guy looks totally like stunned that I—have you ever been picked before for a question? [Laughter]\nGo ahead. Go ahead. Give me a question.\nKurdistan Region of Iraq/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Terrorist OrganizationQ.Thank you very much. My name is Majeed Gly from Rudaw Media Network. I want to, sir, ask you—you always talk about——\nExcuse me, you said where? From where?\nOkay.\nGood. Good. Great people.\nGreat people.\nThank you. Are you a Kurd?\nGood.\nThey're great people. They're great fighters. I like them a lot. Let's go. I like this question so far.\nIt's true.\nWell, we are helping them a lot and we've been very friendly with them. And as you know, we've fought side by side. And we have defeated ISIS—essentially, a very short while ago—in the Middle East. And we did it with a lot of help from the Kurds. And they are: They're great fighters.\nYou know, some people are great fighters, and some people aren't. The Kurds are great fighters. And they're great, great people. And we're going to be working—we're discussing that situation exactly right now.\nWell, I'm just telling you, we're going to be discussing that situation. We have already started discussing that situation. But we have tremendous support from the Kurds in defeating ISIS. Okay?\nUh, yes. Go. Uh-oh.\nYes, I did.\nBecause his tariffs are too high, and he doesn't seem to want to move, and I've told him, \"Forget about it.\" And frankly, we're thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada. That's the mother lode. That's the big one. We're very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.\nWe don't like their representative very much. They've taken advantage—I love Canada, by the way. I have so many friends. I have everybody and so many friends. But that has nothing to do with this; I'm representing the United States.\nMexico was totally—I mean, they were great. By the way, the new President has been great. The deal is done. Now, it has to go through Congress, and you know, a lot things have to happen. But we've done—Bob Lighthizer, who's here someplace. Where's Bob? Bob. Bob Lighthizer has done a great job of negotiating, as they have. But the deal is done. It's up to Congress.\nBut Canada has treated us very badly. They've treated our farmers in Wisconsin and New York State and a lot of other States very badly. Dairy products, 300 percent. Three hundred percent. How do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent? The answer is, you don't. What it is, is a barrier. It's—basically, they're saying: \"We don't have any barriers. By the way, it's 300 percent.\" So you don't send it in, because you can't compete.\nSo Canada has a long way to go. I must be honest with you, we're not getting along at all with their negotiators. We think their negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time. We had people that didn't know what they were doing. And that's why we had—over the last 5 or 6 years, if you average it out—we had $800 billion a year in trade losses. It's ridiculous. It's not going to happen.\nGo ahead.\nI don't like NAFTA. I never liked it. It's been very bad for the United States. It's been great for Canada. It's been great for Mexico. Very bad for us.\nI'm not going to use the name \"NAFTA.\" I refuse to use it. I've seen thousands of plants and factories close. I've seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved. I mean, Mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of NAFTA. Under our deal, it's not going to happen anymore. I hate to tell you, it's not. We're not—we're going to keep companies. And I told the Mexicans, I said, \"We have to keep companies.\" But they're getting a lot, also. They're getting other things. They're getting a lot of good things. Mexico made a very good deal.\nBut with Canada, it's very tough. What we're doing is if we made a deal with Canada—which is a, you know, a good chance still. But I'm not making anything near what they want to do. We're going to be fair.\nWhat we're probably going to do is call it the \"USMC.\" Like the United States Marine Corps, which I love. General Kelly likes it even more. Where's General Kelly? He likes that. \"USMC\"—which would be U.S., Mexico, Canada. But it'll probably or possibly be just \"USM.\" It will be United States and Mexico.\nCanada will come along. Now, if Canada doesn't make a deal with us, we're going to make a much better deal. We're going to tax the cars that come in. We will put billions and billions of dollars into our Treasury. And frankly, we'll be very happy, because it's actually more money than you can make, under any circumstance, with making a deal. Okay?\nGood job too. You do a very good job. Really good. Yes, please, Mr. Kurd.\nGo ahead.\nOh, I thought I just answered that.\nOkay. We're trying to get along very well. We do get along great with the Kurds. We're trying to help them a lot. Don't forget, that's their territory.\nWe have to help them. I want to help them.\nGo ahead, what's next?\nThey fought with us. They fought with us. They died with us. They died. We lost—tens of thousands of Kurds died fighting ISIS. They died for us and with us. And for themselves. They died for themselves. But they're great people. And we have not forget—we don't forget—I don't forget. What happens someday later—but I can tell you that I don't forget. These are great people.\nBoy, I think you've seen that. I must tell you, it's—I don't mind your question because——\nI think there's been no greater change—other than maybe China, because China—unfortunately, their markets have dropped—would you say, 30 percent in the last 4 months, right? I think I watched you recently when you said that. I said: \"I think she's wrong. I think it's actually 32. But that's okay.\" But a lot. [Laughter]\nThere's been no—other than maybe that, but even that. Because China is a very special place. And Iran is a very special place. But I think there's been no country that's changed so much as Iran.\nIn the last 6 months, since I took off the horrible, horrible Iran nuclear deal, as they called it—one of the dumbest deals ever made. As an example, why didn't they take care of Yemen in the deal? Why didn't they take care of Syria in the deal? You know what Kerry said—the reason? \"It was too complicated.\"\nWe're giving $150 billion, we paid $1.8 billion in cash—cash. This whole room would be filled up with hundred-dollar bills. And you'd need probably five rooms like this. But you have $1.8 billion in cash. Why didn't we take care of Yemen? Why didn't we take care of Syria and other? And he said, \"Because it was too complicated.\" Well, you just gave all your cards. You gave them $150 billion. And now Yemen's a mess, but it's getting better.\nAnd Syria's a mess. And I was responsible—and I hope it stays that way—when I put out on social media, a few weeks ago, about Idlib Province. I said, \"Don't do it.\" And I'll tell you, it happened—where I was at a meeting with a lot of supporters, and a woman stood up, and she said: \"There's a province in Syria with 3 million people. Right now the Iranians, the Russians, and the Syrians are surrounding their province. And they're going to kill my sister. And they're going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25,000 or 35,000 terrorists or enemies of theirs.\" But I think we can call them terrorists.\nAnd I said, \"That's not going to happen.\" I didn't hear of Idlib Province. And I came back to New York, and I picked up the failing New York Times—I hate to admit it was the New York Times, but it was the failing New York Times—and I opened it up—not on the front page, but there was a very big story. I said, \"Wow, that's the same story that the woman told me that I found hard to believe.\" Because why would—how would anyone do that with 3 million people? And it said that they were being surrounded, and they were going in and starting—literally, the next day, they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35,000 terrorists.\nAnd I put out on social media and elsewhere—I gave Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, everybody these orders: \"Don't let it happen.\" I said, \"Don't let it happen.\" That doesn't mean they can't be selective. They can't be—you know, go in, and they've got to do what they've got to do with terrorists. I assume they're terrorists. But don't kill millions of people.\nAnd it stopped. You saw that. Nobody's going to give me credit, but that's okay. That's okay. Because the people know. I have had more Syrians thank me for that. This was about 4 weeks ago, I put that out. I said: \"They're surrounding a city of 3 million people. They're going to start bombing the city. Don't let it happen.\" And I meant it, too. I meant it. And millions of people have been saved.\nAnd I gave, today, great credit to Iran. I don't know if you heard that. I gave great credit to Iran, to Russia, and to Syria for not doing it. Now I hope it's going to be surgical, meaning go in and do—it's lengthy and everything else. And they possibly have to do it. But I think millions of people would have been killed. And that would have been a shame.\nAnd hopefully—and I have to tell you, Turkey has been a big help. Turkey has been great. Turkey has helped us very much with that whole situation.\nYes. Yes.\nGood. Thank you very much.\nIt doesn't matter what world leaders think on Iran. Iran's going to come back to me and they're going to make a good deal, I think. Maybe not. Deals: you never know.\nBut they're suffering greatly. They're having riots in every city, far greater than they were during the green period with President Obama. Far greater. When President Obama stuck up for government, not the people. You probably would have had a much different Iran had he not done that. But I'm sticking up for the people. I am with the people of Iran.\nBut here's the thing: They have rampant inflation. Their money is worthless. Everything is going wrong. They have riots in the street. You can't buy bread. You can't do anything. It's a disaster. At some point, I think they're going to want to come back, and they're going to want to say, \"Hey, can we do something?\"\nAnd I'm very simple; I just don't want them to have nuclear weapons. That's all. Is that too much to ask? I don't want them to have nuclear weapons.\nI want them to have a great economy. I want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices—I'm not happy with OPEC. I told them, \"I'm not happy with OPEC.\" We take care of all these people; we defend them. They wouldn't be there for 2 weeks if it wasn't for me and the United States and a much stronger Armed Forces than it was. Because our Armed Forces was depleted. We had old equipment.\nNow, we have—hey, you know better than anybody, $700 billion and $716 billion. We have the most incredible new jets and everything. We need it. Not that I want to spend it, although it is jobs. It's all made in the United States.\nBut Iran has to come back, and they have to talk. And I'm not doing this from strength or weakness. I'm just saying, at some point, I think they're going to have to come back. If you look at what's going on, companies are leaving left and right. Mercedes-Benz just left. They're all leaving. They don't want to be in Iran. Because they have a choice: Do they want to be with Iran, or do they want to be with us?\nAnd we have, by—we picked up $10 trillion since my election. We were being caught by China. Now it's going the other way. People can't believe it. People have never seen this situation with China. Everything's always been for 20 years: \"Oh, China is so great. China is so great.\" You don't hear that so much anymore. I love China; I think they're great. But you don't hear that so much anymore. You know who's great now? We're great now.\nOkay, how about just a couple of more. Now, I could be doing this all day long. I could be doing this all day long. Should we continue for a little while?\nIt doesn't matter to me. A couple of more. I don't care. New York Times, come on. New York Times. The failing New York Times. Stand up. Go ahead.\nNo, I'm talking about the Times is failing. You are far from failing. Go ahead.\nThe Times are very interesting though. The Times, I think they're going to endorse me. [Laughter]\nI think that ABC. I think—well, Fox—I like Fox. I really do.\nBut I think ABC, CBS, NBC, the Times, the—they're all going to endorse me, because if they don't, they're going out of business. Can you imagine if you didn't have me?\nGo ahead, what would you like to say?\nI know that. No, I know that.\nWell, that's fake news.\nYes. It was fake news. And it was covered that way. Okay. So I said that since my election our economy has become the hottest in the world. Tax reductions, regulations, confidence levels are the highest in 18 years—really, soon to be historic. Unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country. You look at Black unemployment. You look at Asian unemployment. You look at women—65 years. The unemployment numbers are among the best we've ever had ever. The numbers of new companies pouring into our country, which nobody thought was possible.\nAnd I said this. And I was in front of a large group of highly professional people, most of whom are from either other countries or the United Nations, people that aren't big into clapping, applauding, smiling. And I heard a little rustle, as I said our country is now stronger than ever before. It's true. I mean, it is true. And I heard a little rustle. And I said, \"It's true.\" And I heard smiles. And I said, \"Oh, I didn't know there there'd be that kind . . .\" They weren't laughing at me. They were laughing with me. We had fun. That was not laughing at me.\nSo the fake news said, \"People laughed at President Trump.\" They didn't laugh at me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together. We had a good time. They respect what I've done.\nThe United States is respected again. The United States was not respected. Everybody was taking advantage of us, from jobs, and taking our companies, and not paying the price—to so many other things, even military protection. I told a number of countries over the last few days, I said: \"Listen, you're a very rich country. We protect you. Without our protection, you would have real problems. You would have real problems.\"\nI said: \"You should reimburse us for this protection. Why are we protecting you?\" And do you want to know what they said after about 2 minutes of talking? They agreed with me. And you can ask this group of very talented people: They agreed with me.\nBut they said—one of them said: \"But Mr. President, nobody ever asked us for that. They never asked us for that.\" Nobody has ever said, \"You should pay.\" These are really wealthy countries.\nI mean, I'll be honest, I just asked Japan. I said: \"We're defending you. You're a very wealthy country. You're sending us millions of cars. You're making a fortune. We have a tremendous trade deficit with you. And we're defending you, and we're subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money.\"\nI said it to South Korea. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea. They're a very wealthy—these are great countries. These are very wealthy countries. I said, \"Why aren't you reimbursing us for our costs?\"\nAnd you know what? They look at me, and they can't even answer it, because there's no answer. If they're a poor country and they needed protection and people were going to die, I'm all for protecting them; I don't want 10 cents. But when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us—massive—and then on top of that, we're paying for their military? Or we're paying for a lot of their military? That doesn't work.\nHow about two more, and we'll call it?\nNo, I didn't say that. Why do you say that?\nFake news.\nWhy—did I say that?\nExcuse me.\nAnd by the way, I think you do a very good job, but I didn't say that. I do watch you. And I think you do a very good job. But I didn't say that.\nSenate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nI said, exactly, \"I look forward to watching her.\" I do want to hear what she says. And maybe she'll say—I could be convinced of anything. Maybe, if she'll say something—but in the meantime, I have to tell you, he's one of the highest quality human beings.\nHe's a tremendous man. He's a tremendous genius. He's a great intellect. He was, I believe, number one at Yale. Is that a correct statement? Number one in his class at Yale.\nHe was a great student in law. He was—you know, I've heard his name. I didn't know him. Didn't know him. Until this whole thing, I didn't know him. But I heard his name for 10 years.\nAnd you know how I heard his name? Everybody was saying he should be on the Supreme Court. I said, \"Who is he?\" \"His name is Brett Kavanaugh. And he should be—he's the most brilliant person. He's the most brilliant lawyer.\" They were talking about him on the Supreme Court 10 years ago. With all of that, I want to hear what she has to say. Okay?\nI've had many false statements against me. And if the press would have reported it, I would have been very happy. I think John Roberts would tell you that.\nYou covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me. Sean Hannity covered it. I will tell you, when I saw that on Sean Hannity, I actually called him. Believe it or not, I don't speak to him very much, but I respect him. I called him. I said: \"This is the biggest story. This is a big, big story.\" He agreed with me. The next day, I picked up the papers. There wasn't one word about it. The next day, I watched ABC news, Jon. I watched NBC. I watched CBS. I didn't watch CNN, but next time, I'm going to. [Laughter]\nI watched everything. There wasn't one story other than Fox. And it's a big story. It's a shame. Okay. Enough. Thank you, though.\nThank you. Thank you.\nGo ahead. That's enough, please.\nGood job. Good job.\nSince you're where? Since you're where?\nI don't blame you. But I'll let you do it after he does it. Is that okay?\nI will do that in honor of a paper I once loved. [Laughter]\nGo ahead.\nI do.\nWell, I'd love to be able to make a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians. You know, my whole life, I was told that's the toughest deal. And I disagree. I think health care is probably tougher, okay? You want to know the truth. But it is tough. But we're going to take care of that, too. And that's going to get taken care of. We've already taken care of a lot of it. But the whole—my life, I've always heard the deal between, as you know, Israel and the Palestinians, that's like the toughest deal. Every possible thing is tough about that. I think we're going to make a deal. I think we're going to make a deal.\nSo, at one of our many meetings today, I was with Bibi Netanyahu, a man who I have a lot of respect for. A man who has been extremely nice to me—very happy that I did the whole thing with Jerusalem and the Embassy, which, by the way, we're going to open in 4 months for less than $500,000. And the budget was over $1 billion, right?\nSo we saved, let's say, a billion dollars. That's not so bad. And it's open. And it's beautiful, by the way. Jerusalem stone, one of my favorite stones. [Laughter]\nI will tell you, the question—somebody said today, \"Well, this is the first news conference in a long time.\" I said: \"What do you mean? I did like, five today.\" [Laughter] Every time I sit, I take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room, meaning, reporters.\nAnd one of the reporters—I won't say that it was John Roberts that said that, I refuse. [Laughter] But one of the—it was, but that's okay. Don't feel guilty, John. But of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one-state, two-state. And I said: \"I think the two-state will happen. I think it's, in one way, more difficult because it's a real estate deal, because you need metes and bounds, and you need lots of carve-outs and lots of everything. It's actually a little tougher deal. But in another way, it works better because you have people governing themselves and\"——\nSo they asked be about that. I said: \"Well, I think the two-state will happen. I think we're going to go down the two-state road.\" And I'm glad I got it out. And Jared, who is so involved—he loves Israel. He loves Israel. But he's also going to be very fair with the Palestinians. He understands it takes two people to be happy, two groups of people to be happy. Everybody has got to be happy. And that's why it's so tough, because there's been so much hatred and anger for so many years. That's what, probably, the number-one ingredient of toughness is. But they asked me—I said I think it's going to be a two-state.\nAnd you know what I did today? By saying that, I put it out there. And if you ask most of the people in Israel, they agree with that. But nobody wanted to say it. It's a big thing to put it out. It's a very big thing to put it out.\nNow, the bottom line: If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that's okay with me. If they want two states, that's okay with me. I'm happy if they're happy. I'm a facilitator. I want to see if I can get a deal done so that people don't get killed anymore.\nWhen we had—in Saudi Arabia—we had one of the great conferences in history. Many of you were there; probably, all of you were there. It was one of the most beautiful 2 days. That, and China—two of the most incredible events I've ever seen—saw yet. I've never seen anything like it.\nAnd we had, I believe, 58 Muslim countries—the leaders. The kings, the amirs, the absolute leaders from every—there was nobody in second place. They were the leaders of the whole thing. And unbeknownst to anybody else, people would come up to me, individually—it wasn't a setup. They'd come up to me and say, \"Sir, you can't have peace in the Middle East without peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\" I said: \"Why? What difference? Why does that matter so much?\" They said, \"It just is impossible to make peace in the Middle East unless you have between the Israelis\"——\nSo I heard that from one—the King of Saudi Arabia, who is a great guy—King Salman. And then, somebody else came up. And he wasn't told, \"Oh, go up and say it.\" I know where they're coming from. And I must have had 12 leaders say it. And they just said it.\nAnd I started to realize that peace between Israel and the Palestinians, for the Middle East, is a very important thing. And we're trying very hard to get it. I think, probably, two-state is more likely. But you know what? If they do a single, if they do a double, I'm okay with it if they're both happy. If they're both happy, I'm okay with either. I think the two-state is more likely.\nOkay, how about one—go ahead.\nOh, okay.\nI would have gotten bad story in the New York Times. But I will anyways, so I guess it doesn't matter.\nOkay, we'll do you after that.\nAnd then, we'll call it quits.\nYou're doing very well.\nSay, \"Thank you, Mr. Trump.\" [Laughter]\nI wonder how you do—you know, all my life, I've had very few stories—but I've had some on the front page of the New York Times. Now, I think I think I average about three or four a day, right?\nAnd of the three or four, they're all negative. No matter what I do, they're negative. But you know what? That's okay. I still love the paper.\nGo ahead. [Laughter]\nI agree.Q.You talk about this friendship you have with Xi Jinping, and yet, essentially, what you did today is accused his Government——\nThat's right.\nThat's right.\nDoing it to help them.\nYou know what? Yes. Doing it to help them.\nI think that we are able to—and maybe he's not anymore. I'll be honest with you, I think we had a very good friendship. I think we had a very good relationship; we understand each other. They are doing studies on Donald Trump. They're trying to figure it all out, because this has never happened to them before. It's never happened.\nThink of it, you've never seen—you've covered very well—you've never seen this happen. They're having big problems. I don't want them to have problems, but they've got to make a fair deal. Just like Canada has got to make a fair deal.\nI believe that he and I have a very good chemistry together. And I can tell you that about many leaders. I can also tell you a few where I don't feel I'll ever have a chemistry with them. I don't want to have a chemistry with them. And for those people, I'll have Pompeo, Nikki, Bolton, Jared. I can go—our General; I'll have our General. Or if they can't do it, I'll have Sarah Huckabee do it. Right?\nBut for the most part, I have very good—very good with Prime Minister Abe. Very good with President Moon. By the way, what President Moon said last night—I know you won't report it—but Bret Baier [Bret Baier, Fox News] interviewed him last night, and he asked him about me. I can't say—because you would say I'm too braggadocious—but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing. \"Couldn't have happened without President Trump, and it never would happen without President Trump. And nobody else could do it.\" You know, I mean, you'll take a look.\nBut I will tell you, China is very special. Very special. They're incredible people. It's an incredible country. What they've done is unbelievable.\nAnd it all started with the WTO. It was a defective deal. And it all started—without the WTO, China is not China as we know it today. And then, it started also by—our people that are standing right in this position, that are in the Oval Office—another way of saying it—allowed them to get away with murder. Allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder.\nI think we still probably have a very good relationship. But you know what? In honor of you, I will, tomorrow, make a call to him. Say, \"Hey, how you doing?\" Okay?Q.Can I—can I just ask——\n\"You don't mind paying billions of dollars a month in tariffs.\"\nChina's Efforts To Influence 2018 Congressional Elections/U.S. Agriculture/North American Free Trade Agreement\nWell, I think it's different. If you look at the Des Moines Register, I mean, they have ads that are made to look like editorials. Saying about: \"Oh, you've got to stop Trump. You've got to stop him. You've got to vote against him.\" My farmers are so incredible. These are patriots.\nYou know, on a network that doesn't like me very much, which is most of them—but a network that didn't—doesn't really treat me very good, they interviewed farmers. And they got hurt because, you know, all of a sudden China stops buying.\nBy the way, they've started buying again. I don't know if you've noticed. And soybeans are going up, and things are going up. And we've had very little hurt from what I've done. In fact, the markets have gone up. And the farmers are going to do great.\nBut ultimately—but they had farmers, and these guys are amazing; I love them. And they voted for me, and they love me. And they said: \"We don't care if we get hurt. He's doing the right thing.\" And you know, a lot of people—it's a complex game. A lot of people don't know exactly what it is. They don't know how to define \"tariff.\" They don't know it is really different than a tax, although it's getting close.\nBut they know that for the first time in many, many years, they have a President that's fighting for them; that's not letting their jobs be taken to other countries; that's not allowing the kind of abuse that we—I mean, when you look at what happened, as an example, with NAFTA. And for years—because it was never changed—NAFTA was defective deal the day it was signed.\nYou know why? Because they had a VAT tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that. And by the time they found out, which was about a week later, nobody went and changed it. So you went many years, and they never changed it. There was a VAT tax that Mexico got. So we were 17 or 16 points behind, before we even started. NAFTA was a horrible thing.\nSo the farmers and—by the way, the steel workers—you know, I stopped the dumping. The dumping was horrible. And now if they want to dump, that's okay, but they've got to pay the United States of America 25 percent on everything they dump. That's okay. But as I told you before, steel is doing phenomenally well.\nBut the farmers say, \"This man is fighting for us. No President has ever fought for us before.\" And you really have to study what's happened over the 15 years with the farmers. The farmers have been decimated over a 15-year period. They've been decimated. The farmers are going to come out great. These are great people. They're great, great patriots.\nI think we should finish with that one. Is that okay?\n[Several reporters shouted questions.]\nOkay. Go ahead. Let's go. Fast.Musician Elton John\nI always like—always like to finish with a good one.\nElton John said, \"When you hit that last tune, and it's good, don't go back.\" [Laughter]\nI've seen—have you ever seen? They do great. They're great. They hit the last tune, and everyone goes crazy. Then, they go back for an encore, right? And they don't hit it. And they leave—everyone leaves. They said, \"That wasn't a very good concert, was it?\"\nLet's go.\nMen Accused of Sexual Assault/Senate Confirmation Hearings for Supreme Court Nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh\nYou—don't make me wrong. Go ahead.\nSay it again. Say it again.\nYes.\nYes.\nRight.\nIt's a very big cultural moment.\nIt's a very big—it's also—you're right. I think it's a great question.\nThis is a very big moment for our country, because you have a man who is very outstanding, but he's got very strong charges against him—probably charges that nobody is going to be able be—to prove.\nSo I could have you chosen for a position. I could have you or you or you—anybody. And somebody could say things. And it's happened to me many times, where false statements are made. And honestly, nobody knows who to believe.\nI could pick another Supreme Court judge—Justice. I could pick another one, another one, another one. This could go on forever. Somebody could come and say: \"Thirty years ago, twenty-five years ago, ten years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this. He did that. He did that.\"\nAnd honestly, it's a very dangerous period in our country. And it's being perpetrated by some very evil people. Some of them are Democrats, I must say. Because some of them know that this is just a game that they're playing. It's a con game. It's at the highest level. We're talking about the United States Supreme Court.\nThis can go on forever. I can pick five other people. At a certain point, the people are going to say, \"No, thank you.\" This is the most coveted job, probably, in the world.\nAnd you know what? I would honestly say—because I interviewed great people for this job. He's great, but I interviewed other great people for this job. I could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying: \"It's too bad what happened to this wonderful man, but I'm going to choose you, number two. I want you to go.\" And I could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job 2 months ago.\nSo this is—this is—and this is beyond Supreme Court.\nThere's nothing beyond Supreme Court; this is beyond Supreme Court. This has everything to do with our country.\nWhen you are guilty until proven innocent, it's just not supposed to be that way. Always I heard, \"You're innocent until proven guilty.\" I've heard this for so long, and it's such a beautiful phrase. In this case, you're guilty until proven innocent. I think that is a very, very dangerous standard for our country.\nWith that being said, I look forward to what she has to say. I also look very forward to what Judge Kavanaugh has to say. I think it's going to be a very, very important day in the history of our country.\nI want to thank you all. We'll do it again.\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-new-york-city-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Leslie Stahl of CBS News \"60 Minutes\"", "Date": "2018-10-14", "Text": "Look, I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again. I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man-made. I will say this. I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs. I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.\nAnd you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man. You don't know.\nWe have scientists that disagree with that.\nWell-- I'm not denying. I'm not denying climate change. But it could very well go back. You know, we're talkin' about over a millions--\n--of years. They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.\nPeople say. People say that in the--\nUh. . . you'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley.\nLook, scientists also have a political agenda.\nYes. Yes.\nNobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out. It's being investigated. It's being looked at very, very strongly. And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case. As of this moment, they deny it. And den-- deny it vehemently. Could it be them? Yes.\nThey deny it. They deny it every way you can imagine. In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer.\nWell, it depends on what the sanction is. I'll give you an example. They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it.\nDo I, well, I tell you what I don't wanna do. Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com-- I don't wanna hurt jobs. I don't wanna lose an order like that. There are other ways of—uh, punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true.\nWell, there's a lot at stake. There's a lot at stake. And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter. There's something-- you'll be surprised to hear me say that. There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case. So we're gonna have to see. We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.\nRight.\nAnd South Korea.\nWell, it's not even that, it's a fact. Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history.\nWell, I consider it a, so far, great achievement. Look, we--\nIt's always so far, till everything's done. I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay? Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter. But, I will say this. The day before I came in, we were going to war with North Korea. I sat with President Obama--\n--and-- we were gonna--I think it was going to end up in war. And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get. Doesn't get any tougher than that. Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough. We were going to war with North Korea. Now, you don't hear that. You don't hear any talk of it. And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it. And you see that, he's agreed to it. No missiles.\nI do trust him, yeah, I trust him. That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --\n--about it? Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you. Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--\nSure. I know. It's-- it's very true. But the fact is, I do trust him. But we'll see what happens.\nAnd I will tell you that they're closing up sites.\nSetting it up.\nWell, nobody really knows. I mean, people are saying that. I've actually said that.\nWe don't really know, Lesley. We really don't know. But I assume--\nLet's say the answer is yes, okay? In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile. They haven't tested a rocket. They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast. It sort of moves the earth. And we have a relationship now.\nWe haven't done that.\nNo, No. I--\nNo I'm not doing it. This isn't the Obama administration. I haven't eased the sanctions. I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. We're meeting. I believe he likes me. I like him. We have a good relationship. It's very important.\nSure. I know all these things. I mean-- I'm not a baby. I know these things.\nLook, look. I-- I-- I like-- I get along with him, okay?\nOkay. That's just a figure of speech.\nIt well, let it be an embrace. Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.\nLook. Let it be whatever it is. I get along with him really well. I have a good energy with him. I have a good chemistry with him. Look at the horrible threats that were made. No more threats. No more threats.\nI get along with him. It's very important. China, let's go.\n$250 billion.\nMight. Might.\nThey wanna negotiate, Lesley. They wanna negotiate.\nLook.\nI have a great chemistry also with President Xi of China. I don't know that that's necessarily going to continue. I told President Xi we cannot continue to have China take $500 billion a year out of the United States in the form of trade and others things.\nAnd I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore.\nSo, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case.\n--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%, again.\nThey can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate. We do $100 billion with them. They do $531 billion with us.\nNo. No, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929.\nI don't want that. No, I don't want that. I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us. I want them to open their markets like our-- our markets are open.\nI called it a skirmish.\nI called it, actually I called it a battle. But, actually, I'm gonna lower that. I consider it a skirmish. And we're gonna win.\nI mean, what's an ally? We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people. But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done.\nAnd yet, they-- it's not hostile.\nYou know what's hostile? The way they treat us. We're not hostile.\n--the stupid country for so many years.\nNow, I like NATO, NATO's fine. But you know what? We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe. And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade. They're not going to do it anymore. They understand that.\nYou don't know that. You don't know that.\nYou don't know that.\nNo, it's not true.\nFrankly, I like General Mattis. I think I know more about it than he does. And I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness, that I can tell you.\nI know-- and, Lesley, you don't have to try again. I know exactly what you're saying--\nThe answer is this. I will always be there with NATO, but they have to pay their way. I'm fully in favor of NATO, but I don't wanna be taken advantage of.\nYeah.\nOkay, you ready?\nExcuse me.\nI didn't? I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers. Obama didn't. You know what he sent? He sent pillows and blankets. I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--\nI think I'm very tough with him personally. I had a meeting with him. The two of us. It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.\nProbably he is, yeah. Probably. I mean, I don't--\nProbably. But I rely on them, it's not in our country.\nOf course they shouldn't do it. And that's your--\nWell, they-- they meddled. But I think China meddled too.\nAnd you wanna know something?\nBecause I think China meddled also. And I think, frankly, China--\n--is a bigger problem.\nI'm not doing anything.\nI'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.\nWell, we'll see what happens come midterms. But--\nHe. . .I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that. I was very disappointed. Why should he have recused himself? So I was very--\n--we'll see what happens.\nNo. No. You can't assume that.\nWell, I-- I don't pledge anything. But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that. I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.\nThere is no collusion. I don't wanna pledge. Why should I pledge to you? If I pledge, I'll pledge. I don't have to pledge to you. But I have-\nI have no intention of doing that.\nDo you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election? Give me a break. They wouldn't be able to help me at all. Call Russia. It's so ridiculous.\nSo when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly. I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great. Lesley, they treat me worse. They got worse instead of better. Very dishonest.\nAnd despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so.\nEverybody makes mistakes.\nI could have been uh, earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal. The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders. I was getting to know countries. I didn't wanna do it right outta the box. So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier.\nYeah. Well, that was the same as the Obama law. You know, Obama had the same thing.\nNo, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation. And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country.\nWell, we're looking at a lot of things. Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were—they're a laughing stock all over the world.\nNo, I want all the laws changed.\n--there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally. And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States.\nGo ahead.\nI will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no. What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally.\nYou don't have to.\nBut it's the same as Obama.\nOkay. So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah. Now I say they're babies.\nThey're babies, the political people. This is the most deceptive, vicious world. It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception. You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.\nWell, I don't wanna give you an example. I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do. Remember that. When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries. Nobody's been able to do anything like this. Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it. But, it's a very deceptive world. The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was. I-- I-- and I really mean it. I'm not saying that as a sound bite. I never--\nWell, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation. When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it.\nWhen I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it.\nI'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.\nLesley, it's okay. In the meantime, I'm President--and you're not.\n--what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together. It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama. I can see the country uniting. I can see it. We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh—you, you know what I'm saying.\nDuring the hearings for the Supreme Court, we had senators that behaved horribly.\nWell, I bashed their attitude. I bashed their statements--\n--so unfair to Judge Kavanaugh. I've never--\nseen anything like it.\nI don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest.\nI think—I, I, I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement. I don't think they wanna be healed. I do wanna heal.\nThe famous Mississippi speech?\nHad I not made that speech, we would not have won. I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.\nAnd you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.\nI didn't really make fun of her.\nWhat I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place.\n(shrugs) Ehh, uhh.\nThey can do what they-- I-- I will tell you this. The way now-Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms. Have you seen what's gone on with the polls?\nbe honest with you.\nI think so, yeah. I did.\nW-- you know what? I'm not gonna get into it because we won. It doesn't matter. We won.\nWhoever it is. Maybe it was The New York Times too.\nNo, no, it's --By the way, you don't know how dishonest The New York Times is. It could've been The New York Times. I doubt it. But it could've been.\nIt also could've been any-- w-- well, don't count on it. It also could've been any one of 3,000 people.\nIt's wrong! It's so false. It's fake news. I'm changing things around. And I'm entitled to. I have people now on standby that will be phenomenal. They'll come into the Administration, they'll be phenomenal.\nYeah, other people will go, sure.\nI think I have a great Cabinet. There're some people that I'm not happy with.\nNo, I don't want to say that. But I have some people that I'm not thrilled with. And I have other people that I'm beyond thrilled with.\nWell, I don't know. He hasn't told me that. I have--\n--a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you wanna know the truth. But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.\nYes.\nI feel the same way. I don't trust everybody in the White House, I'll be honest with you.\nNot so much a wire. I'm usually guarded. And I think I'm guarded anyway. But I'm not saying I trust everybody in the White House. I'm not a baby. It's a tough business. This is a r-- this is a vicious. . . place. Washington DC is a vicious, vicious place. The attacks, the-- the bad mouthing, the speaking behind your back. --but-- you know, and in my way, I feel very comfortable here.\nI think so. I mean, I felt comfortable at the beginning, other than it was a little surreal to say I'm the president of the United States, but I think that's true with everybody.\nNow I very much feel like POTUS. I do. I feel like the president. You know, for a little while, it's like-- \"Mr. President, sir.\" It's-- even my friends, they call me, they-- they don't call me Donald-- they call me Mr. President. And I say, \"Will you please loosen up?\" I've learned on the job. I have.\nI feel very comfortable, yeah.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-leslie-stahl-cbs-news-60-minutes"}
{"Title": "Interview with Catherine Lucey, Zeke Miller and Jonathan Lemire of AP News", "Date": "2018-10-16", "Text": "How is the business of the news? We're keeping you busy?\nWhat are you going to do in 6½ years with a normal boring person here?\nIt's going to be different, going to be different.\nWell, I just put this out, I guess you saw it. I just have it here. I spoke to the crown prince, so you have that. He said he and his father knew nothing about it. And that was very important. And I spoke to him with Mike Pompeo there. And the crown prince. I spoke to the king yesterday, the crown prince, today wanting to know what was going on, what was happening, and he said very strongly that he and his father knew nothing about it but they are starting a major, they've already started a major investigation to find out. And so the answers will be forthcoming.\nWell, the concept of it, I guess. Yesterday, when I spoke with the father, not so much today, but when I spoke to the father, it just sounded to me like he felt like he did not do it. He did not know about it and it sounded like, you know, the concept of rogue killers. But I don't know. I think the investigation will lead to an answer. And they're going to do a very thorough investigation. I believe they're working with Turkey.\nJust the concept of it. No, that was just from my feeling of the conversation with the king, not with the crown prince but with the king.\nWell, I think we have to find out what happened first. You know, here we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent. I don't like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh. And he was innocent all the way. So I was unconcerned. So we have to find out what happened and they are doing a very major investigation. So is Turkey. Plus, they're putting themselves together and doing it. And hopefully they'll get to an answer as to what happened. But I will say they were very strong in their denial about themselves knowing.\nI would say within a week. That's my impression. He said two weeks. But they're going to try and do it in less than a week.\nA little bit.\nIt's a tough year ... The midterms are very tough for anybody the opposite of president, for whatever reason, nobody has been able to say.\nNo, I think I'm helping people. Look, I'm 48 and 1 in the primaries, and actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful that people don't even talk about. But many of those 48, as you know, were people that had no chance, in some cases. We look at Florida, you look at Donovan in Staten Island. He was losing by 10 points, I endorsed him and he won. I could give you a long list of names. Look at Georgia governor of Georgia. And many, many races. And I will say that we have a very big impact. I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of an impact. They would say that in the old days that if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support of somebody it would be nice to have, but it meant nothing, zero. Like literally zero. Some of the people I've endorsed have gone up 40 and 50 points just on the endorsement.\nSo I think we're going to do well. Look, it feels to me very much like '16. I was going out and making speeches and I was getting tens of thousands of people. And I was getting literally tens of thousands of people, also, more than Hillary in the same location. And I said, ‘Why am I going to lose?' I mean, I go out, I make a speech like I have, you know, 25 times more people than she gets. And I didn't need Beyonce to get them. I didn't have to have, you know, entertainment and entertainers to get them. And then they'd all leave before she made the speech after the entertainer was finished. Honestly, it feels very much like it did in '16.\nNow, I'm not sure that that's right. And I'm not running. I mean, there are many people that have said to me, ‘Sir, I will never ever,' you on the trail when I'm talking to people backstage etcetera, ‘I will never ever go and vote in the midterms because you're not running and I don't think you like Congress.' Well, I do like Congress because I think, and when I say Congress I like the Republicans that support me in Congress. We've had tremendous support. I mean, we've got the taxes with 100 percent Republican votes and we don't really have much of a majority. You know when you say majority, I always say, ‘If somebody has a cold, we have to delay the vote.' So I get along, you know, very ... people have no idea how low how well I get along with Republicans in Congress. I get along well with a lot of the Democrats in Congress, but I'll never get their vote.\nI will say, that fight because he was treated so viciously and violently by the Democrats. That fight has had an impact on energy, and it's had an impact on the Republican Party, a very positive one in terms of getting out and voting. I think, but I'll let you know in three weeks.\nI did speak with him, I did. No, I didn't say thank you, per se. But I did speak to him before it and we had a great conversation about Kavanaugh, what an outstanding person he is, which is what he told me. And we had a very pleasant conversation, a very good conversation.\nNo, I didn't. Nobody called from the Supreme Court. It's a very august body. It's a group of people that, once you're elevated to that level, you really tend to be in a different place, in a different world. No, I didn't, I never got a call. As an example, I did not get a call from Justice Gorsuch, who would be the most likely, or Justice Thomas. Or Alito. I've got no calls.\nSure.\nThey have to do whatever they do, and I'll do whatever I do. But I've had the most successful two years. I would say, without question, first two years of office, I've had the most successful two years in the history of this country as a president. And we're not even close, actually, if you think about it. It's not until Jan. 20 so we're not even really close to two years. And, would get me the list? Would you get me the list, please?\nI have the most successful. Nobody has done what I've done, and nobody has come close in the first two years of office. And that's despite the fighting, the Democrats' obstruction.\nHere, these are just some. I just put them down rough. But take a look at that. You all set?\nI mean, you go point after point, each point is a major event, but you just take a look. Confirmed more circuit court judges than any other new administration. Soon it will be than any administration in history. Who is the one, who's the one president that percentage-wise has done better than me? There's only one. George Washington — 100 percent.\nNobody has gotten that yet.\nTotally false. It's totally false.\nOh, absolutely he's lying. And Michael Cohen was a PR person who did small legal work, very small legal work. And what he did was very sad, when you look. By the way, he was in trouble not for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for himself. You do know that? Having to do with loans, mortgages, taxicabs and various other things, if you read the paper. He wasn't in trouble for what he did for me; he was in trouble for what he did for other people. He represented me very little. It's a very low level. And what he was is also a public relations person. And now if he wants to try and get a little bit lighter sentence for what he did ... Totally uninvolved. I wasn't involved and he had other clients, No. 1. And No. 2, he was a contractor to a large extent. But Michael Cohen, if you take a look at what he did, this had to do with loans, and I guess the taxi industry is something that I have nothing to do with, he did this on his own time.\nGo ahead.\nI won a case yesterday, a big case. They sued. Got thrown out. And not only did they get thrown out, but I get legal fees, which is quite unusual, because the case is so obnoxious and so wrong. And I give tremendous credit to the judge. And not only that, we go by Texas law. Texas law says you get every penny that you spent. Texas law is very tough for the legal fees.\nYou know what? You can take it any way you want.\nDid you see the letter? She put out a letter. I had nothing to do with her. So she can lie and she can do whatever she wants to do. She can hire a phony lawyer. You take a look at this guy, a stone-cold loser. Take a look at his past. They can say anything about me. I'm just saying, I just speak for myself. You take a look, and you make your own determination.\nWell, you'd have to speak to the lawyers. I don't even know what the lawyers are doing, but they are very good lawyers. They'll figure it out.\nI said the worst hurricane was 50 years ago, far worse than what this one was. Then, in 1890, they had one that was even worse. This was No. 3 or 4 or 5. We had worse hurricanes in 1890, we had worse, a worse hurricane 50 years ago. We've gone through a period, actually, fairly recently, where we have very few. I live in Florida to a large extent and spend a lot of time in Florida, and we had a period of time where we went years without having any major problem. And then you have a problem and it goes in cycles, and I want absolutely crystal clear water and I want the cleanest air on the planet and our air now is cleaner than it's ever been. Very important to me. But what I'm not willing to do is sacrifice the economic well-being of our country for something that nobody really knows. And you have scientists on both sides of the issue. And I agree the climate changes, but it goes back and forth, back and forth. So we'll see.\nI mean, you know, I am a person that believes very, very strongly in the environment. I am truly an environmentalist. I know some people might not think of me as that, but I'm an environmentalist. Everything I want and everything I have is clean. Clean is very important — water, air. But I also want jobs for our country. And if we would have, as an example, entered certain agreements with other countries, I actually think that we're doing it so they could have an economic advantage. Because we would have had a tremendous— we would have been at a tremendous economic disadvantage if we entered into certain agreements.\nNo, no. Some say that and some say differently. I mean, you have scientists on both sides of it. My uncle was a great professor at MIT for many years. Dr. John Trump. And I didn't talk to him about this particular subject, but I have a natural instinct for science, and I will say that you have scientists on both sides of the picture.\nOK, what's next?\nWell, the probe is ridiculous. OK. That that probe was even started. Jeff Sessions should have never recused himself. He did it for ... and he did it immediately. He should have told me that. And he recused himself. And even people that are not my friends say that was a horrible thing that he did to the president, a horrible thing. He should be ashamed of himself for doing it. He should have told me that beforehand. And if he would have told me that beforehand, I probably would have put somebody else in the Department of Justice. But Jeff Sessions should never have recused himself.\nI haven't said I was going to fire him or not.\nI could fire him whenever I want to fire him, but I haven't said that I was going to.\nI just haven't said I was going to fire him. We'll see what happens. But if you ask me: Am I thrilled? No, I am not thrilled.\nWell, I can say this. I knew nothing about the meeting that you're talking about. My son's a good young guy. He did what every other person in Congress would do if somebody came up to them, said, ‘Hey, I have information on your opponent.' I don't know of any politician. And I think I can speak for the people in this room that would have said, ‘Oh, gee, information on my opponent and it's bad information?' Name me a politician that would have turned that down. There is no such thing as that kind of a politician. So that's what they heard. They heard it was about Hillary Clinton. They had a meeting or he had a meeting with some people. The meeting became about a different subject and they couldn't get out of the meeting fast enough.\nNow here's the important thing. After the meeting, nothing happened. It was like, ‘Hey, let's get together next week. Let's get together tomorrow. Let's get together.' Nothing happened out of that meeting. Absolutely nothing. He did absolutely nothing wrong. And there's nobody harder on my son than I am. And I would tell you, the press has made a fake news deal out of that meeting. If he did something wrong, I would have been livid. I could never really blame him because I've had people come up to me, senators. I've had a lot of political people say, ‘Your son didn't do anything wrong. That was just a meeting. It was called oppo research.' A lot of the politicians would call it opposition research. There was nothing wrong with that. But here's more important. Nothing from the day of that meeting. It ended. And if you listen to people, it sounded like it ended like they couldn't get out fast enough. There was nothing wrong with having an opposition research meeting and nothing happened from the meeting. If that meeting went, ‘Oh, let's have another meeting next week or let's have a meeting tomorrow or let's start doing this or that or a hundred different things,' that's different. That's totally different depending on what they were going to do. But nothing happened.\nI won't respond, but you're right — we are looking at certain questions having to do with the word collusion. Of course there was no collusion. So we are looking at that, and we'll make a determination.\nWe'll see how that works out. You know that's in process. It's a tremendous waste of time for the president of the United States. To think that I would be even thinking about using Russia to help me win Idaho. We're using Russia to help me win the great state of Iowa or anywhere else is the most preposterous, embarrassing thing. And I will say that the Democrats know it and they wink. They're all laughing. And you know if I often hear that Russia likes to sow discord. The word is sow, an old English term. They like to sow chaos and discord. Well, if that's the case, you gave it to them on a silver platter because this is ridiculous. This was an excuse made by the Democrats for the reason they lost the electoral college, which gives them a big advantage — a big advantage. Very different than the popular vote. The popular vote would be much easier to win if you were campaigning on it. You know, it's like running the 100-yard dash versus a 10-mile run. You train differently. Nobody explained that to Hillary Clinton, by the way. Someday she'll figure it out. But winning the electoral college is a tremendous advantage for the Democrats. And this was an excuse for how they lost the election. How they lost an election they should have won. And one of the reasons they lost because I happened to be a great candidate. And another reason they lost is that Hillary forgot to campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and I guess she needed a lot more time in North Carolina, a lot more time in South Carolina and a lot more time in a place called — a beautiful, sunny, wonderful place— called Florida.\nSure.\nBy the way, many of the children — and this is unfortunate, I covered it so nicely on '60 Minutes,' but they only put on pieces of it, and they were fine but you know they cut, cut, cut because I guess they have so much time, although I heard that they did very nicely on the show. Did they do well?\nSo congratulations to them, but I wish they would have left the entire answer. When people enter our country illegally, there are consequences to pay. But despite the consequences, you have many children that, sadly, are there without parents. Then you have people that grab children and use them as a prop and it's a disgrace. And they come in with a child and they don't even know who the child is five hours before. And that's a shame. That's a terrible thing what they do.\nThey take children and they use them to try and come into our country. There are many, many bad things going on on the border. We have the worst laws in the history of the world on immigration, and we're getting them changed one by one. We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of weeks even, but we're getting them changed one by one. But you have children that we're taking care of, that don't even have parents at least anywhere within hundreds of miles of the border, and we're taking those children, caring for those children, and in many cases sending them back to their parents in countries where their parents didn't even make the journey up with them, incredibly. And some of those children are really young. And we are, actually, in fact, today there was a beautiful statement put out by the Washington Examiner congratulating us on the great job we do with children. Now President Obama had the same law; he did the same thing. And, in fact, the picture of children living in cages that was taken in 2014 was a picture of President Obama's administration and the way they handled children. They had the kids living in cages. They thought it was our administration and they used it and then unbeknownst to them and the fake news, they found out, ‘Oh my God, this is a terrible situation.' This was during the Obama administration.\nHere's the thing. I think we've done an incredible job with children. As I just said, we've taken children who have no parents with them standing on the border. We've taken many children, and I'm not talking about a small percentage, I'm talking about a very large percentage where they have no people, no parents. In addition to that, we're separating children who are just met by people that are using them coming into the border, not their parents. They are using them coming into the border. The one thing I will also say is that when a person thinks they will not be separated, our border becomes overrun with people coming in. So that's another problem. With all of that being said, we're getting the laws changed so that catch and release, so that visa lottery, so that chain migration and every other form of incredible stupidity can be taken out of our system.\nThe parents would sometimes come up with their kids, leave them at the border and go back. So we're in this position where we have an innocent young child at the border; there are no parents. We take them in, we care for the child and then we get horrible publicity. We should be getting great publicity, and the Washington Examiner did a great piece today on the fact that we've done a great job. And President Obama had the same law. And, by the way, he separated children and there are many pictures of jail cells where the children were separate from the parents.\nWe should be getting credit for the job we've done.\nYes.\nThe main thing I have to see is, I have to see safety at home and — not a vast difference, by the way — but a little bit more. But it's not a lot more, it's a little bit more. I have to see safety at home. And if I think people are likely to do some very bad things in faraway places to our homeland, I'm going to have troops there for a period of time. But we've done an excellent job. We've defeated ISIS. ISIS is defeated in all of the areas that we fought ISIS, and that would have never happened under President Obama. In fact, it is going the other way. And I think we fought extremely effectively on everything I've wanted to do. Now there will be a certain point where that takes place.\nWe're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens. I want, No. 1, the safety of our country. And if that means knocking the hell out of them, of terrorists, long before they can ever get here, that's OK with me. And if I could help Europe and other places by doing it, that's OK with me. And they're starting to pay us for that, by the way, much more substantially than they ever paid before. You understand that's an important thing because it's unfair that the burden is all on us. As it has been. But we are ... we've made ... we've had tremendous success there. We've had tremendous success in North Korea, tremendous success in North Korea.\nWell, I will do that at some point, but I don't think it's overly necessary. I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. I mean, this is the greatest economy we've ever had, best unemployment numbers. Many groups are, you know, we've never even been close to these numbers. I'm doing a lot of things. I'm doing a lot of things. But it's something I'd do. And do gladly. Nobody has been better at the military. Hey, I just got them a pay raise. I haven't had a pay raise in 11 years. I just got them a substantial pay raise. ‘They' meaning our military people. I just got them new equipment. They have stuff that was so old that the grandfathers used to fly it. I have done more for the military than any president in many, many years.\nYeah, we will have one, but it is going to be after the midterms because I want to stay around here.\nI want to stay around and help people get elected.\nNo, I don't think so. I mean, we haven't set it up yet, but I would think not yet. At some point, that will happen, too.\nExcuse me. No. 1, I had to take care of our military. I had no choice but to do it, and I want to take care of our military. We had to do things that we had to do. And I've done them. Now we're going to start bringing numbers down. We also have tremendous numbers with regard to hurricanes and fires and the tremendous forest fires all over. We had very big numbers, unexpectedly big numbers. California does a horrible job maintaining their forests. They're going to have to start doing a better job or we're not going to be paying them. They are doing a horrible job of maintaining what they have. And we had big numbers on tremendous numbers with the forest fires and obviously the hurricanes. We got hit in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, Georgia. Georgia was hit very hard this time. Nobody even, you know, treats that one fairly. The farmers got hit very, very hard.\nWants to consider what?\nThat I haven't heard.\nI haven't heard that. I'm leaving Social Security. I'm not touching Social Security.\nYeah, I do.\nPeople I don't trust.\nYes. I've made a decision. He's ... you've been reading a little bit about it. A very fine man, highly respected by a lot of people: Pat (Cipollone).\nI have many people that want the job. I have such a good relationship with Nikki. And I've talked to her about it, too. I will be talking to her about it. But I have many people that want the job, and I would say I'll be making that decision over the next week or two. They're going to work with Nikki for a little while. She going to go till the end of the year, and they'll be working with Nikki.\nHey, look, I did the NFL a big favor. You know that, right?\nNo. You didn't know this? You didn't know this?\nSo the NFL was having a tremendous problem with Canada on the Super Bowl and advertising and all sorts of things — very complicated subject. And in about two seconds, I got, in about 30 seconds, I got that one fixed up for the NFL. They're going to make a tremendous amount of additional money because of what I did for them. It was a favor for them and it wasn't for NFL, it was that this is a great American company. I was negotiating against Canada. And one of the things, I said ‘I want the NFL fixed,' because it had to do with them keeping revenues from advertising and for not allowing the NFL to advertise in Canada. And it was very unfair and everybody knew that and Canada knew it, too. And Canada plays a very tough game. So I said I want that fixed and nobody wrote a story about it because why would they ever write about it? And, by the way, Commissioner Goodell called me last week and he, ‘thank you very much.' But I settled that for the NFL. It took me literally about a minute because that's a small deal compared to the big deal. And Canada knew it was the right thing to do. So I helped a great American corporation. You have to understand, I like the NFL. I want the NFL to do well. I have many friends that are in the NFL, owners and others. I want them to do very well. I also want them standing for the American flag, not kneeling, but I just helped the NFL settle a problem that they couldn't settle for 15 years or something. This has been going on, a vicious battle with Canada, for years. I settled it. And not one person has written about it. Why don't you call what you call Commissioner Goodell and ask him. Roger. He called me last week. I thought he was calling me about the flag to say ‘ceasefire.' But he didn't. He called me just to thank me, and I said, ‘That was very nice.' It was a very nice phone call. You should do something about it if you want.\nWho?\nI never even was asked about it. I haven't thought about it. But, you know, I think it's a very sad, sad situation. And there's another thing that had nothing to do with me. That was from years before. You do understand that, right? Do you understand that? Do you know these Russian hackers you're talking about from Moscow? They have nothing to do with me. How many people are they? Only 28 people? They have nothing to do with me. They were hackers from Moscow. Some of them supported Hillary Clinton. They had nothing to do with me. You look at all the stuff, it's just nothing to do with me.\nWell, it depends on what we find out over the next couple of days. He doesn't have to make that determination until Friday, and I think we'll also be guided by what other countries are doing. You know, we'll look at that.\nI do think this. I do think that they have ordered billions, one of the largest military orders in the history of the country. I think that we hurt ourselves far more than we hurt Saudi Arabia when we cancel an order like that.\nToo early to say. I have to find out what happened. Once they find out what happened, I'll be able to tell you exactly.\nNo. Because the other term ... first of all, there's always things to do. Actually, it's a very nice question because I have done so much. People have said that, ‘You've done so much. You may have it all put back together. And our country: Make America Great Again.' And they do ask me that question. So if you do all of the things that you're doing and you're given another two years, which is a lot of time because I've done this in far less than two years, and those papers pretty much say it, they do ask that question. There's always something to do. And you know, the new motto is Keep America Great. I don't want somebody to destroy it because I can do a great job. But the wrong person coming in after me sitting right at this desk can destroy it very quickly, if they don't do the right thing. So no I'm definitely running.\nSo far, all of them. So far, all of them. I don't see any talent. No talent.\nI see no talent.\nWell, Biden ran twice and actually a lot of people think he really ran a third time, but he was so low in the polls that he never registered. But he ran twice. And I call him One Percent Joe because you know he did very poorly and then Obama took him off the trash heap and made him vice president. And in a sense he did a good job as vice president, in my opinion, because Obama liked him, and if President Obama didn't like him, you would have been hearing about it. So in that sense, he, I think, he did actually a nice job because the president of the United States felt very comfortable about him. Like, I like my vice president very, very much. That's an important function.\nThank you all.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-catherine-lucey-zeke-miller-and-jonathan-lemire-ap-news"}
{"Title": "Interview with Jonathan Karl of ABC News", "Date": "2018-10-31", "Text": "Well, we certainly try. I'm looking to unify. I always like to unify. We will certainly try. They've had a very hard time because they haven't been winning. We'll see what happens five days from now. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be a close race. And they don't talk about the blue wave anymore. It's going to be a very close race. I think in the Senate we're looking very good. I feel very good about the Senate. And frankly I think we feel pretty good about the House. But it's a lot of people. So many races it's hard for me to get to every one of them. With the Senate, we've gotten to just about everyone I needed to get to. And I think we're going to do very well.\nI've been an open book for so long, Jon. You know that better than anybody. I'm an open book. And frankly, so many people have looked at me for so many years it's probably one of the reasons I won. I think they're going to want to get along too. If they—look on the assumption they win the House, maybe they win both, and maybe they lose both -– who knows, it's going to be close. Although I'm starting to see the Senate is not looking that close. It's going to be very interesting. I think they're going to want to do things. I think they're going to get legislation passed. We need things on the border, we need things on immigration--they know that too. If you look at education, you look at health care, they're going to want to get things done. So I have a feeling it would be different than a lot of people would believe. But maybe not.\nYeah.\nIt's very important. We have to have a wall of people—very highly trained people, terrific, dedicated patriots. That's what they are. You have caravans coming up that look a lot larger than it's reported actually. I'm pretty good at estimating crowd size. And I'll tell you they look a lot bigger than people would think. So we'll find out. They had a very rough one just formed in El Salvador if you can believe it. And it was very nasty, you saw what took place. And you look at what's coming up through Honduras through Mexico. And Mexico is helping us. But these are rough people in those crowds. And Mexico suffered a lot of damage in the last skirmish.\nActually it's mostly men. Actually mostly young men. And a lot of rough people, lot of rough people, Jon. You look—and it's been well reported—it's a lot of young people, lot of young men. They are pushing the women right up to the front—not good—and the kids right up to the front. But if you take a look at the caravans—and now there's more than one. There's two or three forming. And you take a look at it and they're strong young men. And you look at the skirmish they had with the Mexican police and army and it was a nasty skirmish.\nWell it depends, it depends.\nNational emergency covers a lot of territory. They can't invade our country. You look at that it almost looks like an invasion. It's almost does look like an invasion—\nI do think so. When you look at some of them, when you look at some of the people in them, yeah, I think it can be considered an invasion. We can't have it. We can't have it from a cost standpoint.\nThey are some dangerous people. These are some rough people. I mean you look at MS-13, they come from that area. This is a very rough group of people coming up. Not in all places but this is a very rough group of people. Look what they did to the Mexican army at the border. Look at the skirmish they just had. Very bad thing for the Mexican army; that was not easy. We'll see what happens and hopefully there won't be a confrontation.\nNo, but I want to replace preexisting conditions and I've always been there. What the Democrats are going to do is destroy our entire health care and you're not going to have any health care. You would destroy the country. You are not going to have health care. The Democrats are going to literally—you'll have to pay three times the taxes and they'll destroy health care as we know it in this country. You won't have preexisting conditions. You wont have anything.\nI don't think they're going to have a choice because it's going to be so bad. So expensive and the health care is going to be terrible. I don't think they're going to have a choice. It's going to be a very bad situation.\nWell, I try. I do try. I think you try too. You say things about me that aren't necessarily correct. I do try, and I always want to tell the truth. When I can, I tell the truth. And sometimes it turns out to be where something happens that's different or there's a change, but I always like to be truthful.\nWell, I was told that. But I will say this, we're the country people want to come to. And what they were referring to when they gave me that information is that we're the country they want to come to. People want to come to the United States. And I sort of jokingly say it's my fault, because I have really made this country strong economically. People want to come into the U.S. now because we're doing well economically, Jon, as good as well as we've ever done as a country. And people are flowing up and I get it. And I want them to come in, but I want them to come in legally and based on merit. We have a lot of companies that are coming in. Companies from Japan, car companies going to Michigan, going all over. Foxconn going to Wisconsin. We need workers. At 3.7 percent unemployment, which is a 50-year low, is that we need workers, Jon. And I want people to come in. I really do. I want people from the caravans to come in but they have to come in legally and through merit. We need workers.\nWell, I didn't think he should be saying what he said. And he called me right after that. We're fine. I didn't think he should be saying—I think he's wrong, OK? I think he's wrong. You know who's going to iron that out pretty quickly? The Supreme Court of the United States.\nWe're going to do great in the Senate, as you can probably see and say, and you say—but we're doing pretty well in the Senate. And I think we're doing pretty well in the House. You know what I'll say? It's going to be an interesting evening.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jonathan-karl-abc-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Washington, D.C.", "Date": "2018-11-07", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much. Please, thank you.\nIt was a big day yesterday, an incredible day. And last night the Republican Party defied history to expand our Senate majority while significantly beating expectations in the House for the midtown—and midterm year. We did this in spite of a very dramatic fundraising disadvantage driven by Democrats' wealthy donors and special interests and very hostile media coverage, to put it mildly. The media coverage set a new record and a new standard.\nWe also had a staggering number of House retirements. So it's a little tough. These are seats that could've been held pretty easily, and we had newcomers going in, and a lot of them worked very hard. But it's very difficult when you have that many retirements.\nWe held a large number of campaign rallies with large, large numbers of people going to every one—to the best of my knowledge, we didn't have a vacant or an empty seat; I'm sure you would have reported it if you spotted one—including 30 rallies in the last 60 days. And we saw the candidates that I supported achieve tremendous success last night.\nAs an example, of the 11 candidates we campaigned with during the last week, 9 won last night. This vigorous campaigning stopped the blue wave that they talked about. I don't know if there ever was such a thing, but could've been. If we didn't do the campaigning, probably, there could've been. And the history really will see what a good job we did in the final couple of weeks in terms of getting some tremendous people over the finish line. They really are tremendous people, but many of them were not known. But they will be known.\nThis election marks the largest Senate gains for a President's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962. There have been only four midterm elections since 1934 in which a President's party has gained even a single Senate seat. As of now, we picked up, it looks like, three. Could be four. Perhaps it could be two. But we picked up a lot. And most likely, the number will be three. You people probably know that better than I do at this point, because you've looked at the more recent numbers.\nFifty-five is the largest number of Republican Senators in the last 100 years. In the last 80 years, a sitting President's party has only gained a cumulative total of eight Senate seats, averaging one per decade. So if we picked up two, three, or four, that's a big percentage of that number. So in the last 80 years—you think of that—only eight seats.\nIn President Obama's first midterm election, he lost six Senate seats, including in the deep-blue State of Massachusetts. Republicans captured at least four Senate seats held by Democrat incumbents. And these are tremendously talented, hard-working people that did this: Indiana, North Dakota, Florida, Missouri. We also won two open Senate seats in Tennessee—I want to congratulate our great champion who did such a great job in Tennessee, Marsha—and in Utah. And Arizona is looking very good. Really, very good. She's done a terrific job. That was a tough race, and she's done a fantastic job.\nIn each of these open seats, Democrats recruited very strong candidates with substantial fundraising and media support. We were getting bombarded with money on the other side. In the House, Republicans dramatically outperformed historical precedence and overcame a historic number of retirements, the most House Republican retirements in 88 years; 43 House Republicans retired.\nNow, I will say this—that, in many cases, they were chairmen of committees, and they left because they weren't chairmen, because the Republicans have a rule—for 6 years. And what that does is wonderful in one way; it lets people come through the system and become chairman. And in another way, it drives people out. Because when they're a chairman, they don't want to go and not be a chairman. You're the chairman of a committee, and you're a big deal, and all of a sudden, you're not doing that anymore. So they leave. We had a lot of them leave. It's—I guess you can flip a coin as to which system is better. The Democrats do the other. Some of their folks have been on these committees for a long time as chairman.\nIn 2010, President Obama's first midterm, he lost 63 seats. By contrast, as of the most current count, it looks like around 27 House seats or something. And we'll figure that out pretty soon.\nWe also had a slew of historic wins in the Governors' races—the Governors' races were incredible—against very well-funded, talented, and skilled Democrat candidates and people that worked very, very hard, respectfully, for those candidates, like Oprah Winfrey, who I like. [Laughter] I don't know if she likes me anymore, but that's okay. She used to. But she worked very hard in Georgia. Very, very hard.\nAnd if you look at them, we have four Governors' races crucial to 2020 and the Presidential race: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. The big ones: Florida, Iowa, Ohio, and Georgia. Can't get much more important than that. They were incredible. They were actually incredible campaigns too. Incredible.\nAs of right now, Republicans will control the majority of Governorships across the country, including three great women who worked very hard: the Governors of Alabama, South Dakota, and Iowa. They worked very, very hard. And they're very talented.\nBy expanding our Senate majority, the voters have also clearly rebuked the Senate Democrats for their handling of the Kavanaugh hearings. That was a factor, I think maybe a very big factor. The way that was handled, I think, was—tremendous energy was given to the Republican Party by the way they treated then-Judge Kavanaugh, now Justice Kavanaugh. And expressed their support for confirming more great pro-Constitution judges.\nCandidates who embraced our message of low taxes, low regulations, low crime, strong borders, and great judges excelled last night. They excelled. They really—I mean, we have a list of people that were fantastic, and I'm just going to point them out: Mike Bost; Rodney Davis; Andy Barr was fantastic. I went to Kentucky—for the most part, I didn't campaign for the House, but I did actually make a special trip for Andy Barr because he was in a very tough race in Kentucky, and he won. That was a very tough race. The polls were all showing that he was down and down substantially. And he won. And that one I did do. Pete Stauber of Minnesota, great guy; he's new and ran a fantastic race.\nOn the other hand, you had some that decided to \"let's stay away.\" \"Let's stay away.\" They did very poorly. I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad, but I feel just fine about it. Carlos Curbelo; Mike Coffman—too bad, Mike. [Laughter] Mia Love. I saw Mia Love. She'd call me all the time to help her with a hostage situation, being held hostage in Venezuela. But Mia Love gave me no love—[laughter]—and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia. [Laughter] And Barbara Comstock was another one. I mean, I think she could have won that race, but she didn't want to have any embrace. For that, I don't blame her. But she lost, substantially lost. Peter Roskam didn't want the embrace. Erik Paulsen didn't want the embrace. And in New Jersey, I think he could have done well, but didn't work out too good. Bob Hugin, I feel badly because I think that's something that could have been won. That's a race that could have been won. John Faso.\nThose are some of the people that, you know, decided for their own reason not to embrace, whether it's me or what we stand for. But what we stand for meant a lot to most people. And we've had tremendous support and tremendous support in the Republican Party. Among the biggest support in the history of the party. I've actually heard, at 93 percent, it's a record. But I won't say that, because who knows. But we've had tremendous support.\nAmerica is booming like never before, doing fantastic. We have Larry Kudlow here, and he said the numbers are as good as he's ever seen—numbers—at any time for our country. But he's a young man, so he hasn't seen that many numbers. [Laughter] Where's Larry? You're a young man, right, Larry? And you haven't been doing this too long, but they're as good as you've ever seen. And we may have—if you have a question for Larry, we'll do that.\nBut I want to send my warmest appreciation in regards to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. We really worked very well together. We have been working very well together. We actually have a great relationship. People just don't understand that, which is fine.\nAnd also to, perhaps—it looks like, I would think—Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And I give her a lot of credit. She works very hard, and she's worked long and hard. I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished.\nHopefully, we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. These are some of things that the Democrats do want to work on, and I really believe we'll be able to do that. I think we're going to have a lot of reason to do it.\nAnd I will say, just as a matter of business, I was with some very successful people last night. We were watching the returns. So if the Republicans won—and let's say we held on by two or one or three—it would've been very hard out of that many Republicans to ever even get support among Republicans, because there will always be one or two or three people that, for a good reason or for a bad reason or for grandstanding—we have that too; you've seen that. You've seen that. Plenty of grandstanding. But for certain reasons, that many people, you're always going to have a couple that won't do it. So that puts us in a very bad position.\nIn other words, had we kept it, and this is no—I'm saying this for a very basic reason; it's common sense—it puts us in a very tough position. We win by one or two or three, and you'll have one or two or three or four or five, even, come over and say, you know: \"Look, we're not going to along with this. We want this, this, this.\" And all of a sudden, we can't even—we wouldn't even be able to get it, in many cases, out of the Republicans' hands before we sent it on to the Senate.\nAnd now we have a much easier path, because the Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for health care, a plan for whatever they are looking at, and we'll negotiate. And as you know, it's been very hard in the Senate, because we need, essentially, 10 votes from Democrats, and we don't get those votes. Because the Democrats do really stick together well. I don't agree with them on a lot of policy, but I agree with them on sticking together. They stick together great. So now we go into the Senate. We don't have the 10 votes. And what happens? It doesn't get passed. Even if it gets out of the House, it doesn't get passed. So under the new concept of what we're doing, I say: \"Come on. Let me see what you have.\" They want to do things. You know, I keep hearing about investigations fatigue. Like from the time—almost from the time I announced I was going to run, they've been giving us this investigation fatigue. It's been a long time. They've got nothing. Zero. You know why? Because there is nothing.\nBut they can play that game, but we can play it better. Because we have a thing called the United States Senate. And a lot of very questionable things were done between leaks of classified information and many other elements that should not have taken place. And all you're going to do is end up in back and forth and back and forth. And 2 years is going to go up, and we won't have done a thing.\nI really think, and I really respected what Nancy said last night about bipartisanship and getting together and uniting. She used the word \"uniting\" and she used the bipartisanship statement, which is so important, because that's what we should be doing. So we can look at us, they can look at us, and then we can look at them, and it'll go back and forth. And it'll probably be very good for me politically. I could see it being extremely good politically, because I think I'm better at that game than they are, actually. [Laughter]\nBut we'll find out. I mean, you know, we'll find out. Or we can work together. You can't do them simultaneously, by the way. Just think if somebody said, \"Oh, you can do them both.\" No, you can't. Because if they're doing that, we're not doing the other, just so you understand. So we won't be doing that.\nBut now what happens is, we send it to the Senate, and we'll get a hundred-percent Democrat support, and we'll get some Republican support. And if it's good, I really believe we have Republicans that will help with the approval process, and they will really help with the approval process.\nSo it really could be a beautiful bipartisan type of situation. If we won by one or two or three or four or five, that wouldn't happen. And the closer it is, the worse it is. This way, they'll come to me, we'll negotiate. Maybe we'll make a deal, maybe we won't. That's possible. But we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure.\nWe want to do something on health care; they want to do something on health care. There are a lot of great things that we can do together. And now we'll send it up, and we will really get—we'll get the Democrats, and we'll get the Republicans, or some of the Republicans. And I'll make sure that we send something up that the Republicans can support, and they're going to want to make sure they send something up that the Democrats can support.\nSo our great country is booming like never before, and we're thriving on every single level, both in terms of economic and military strength; in terms of development. In terms of GDP, we're doing unbelievably.\nI will tell you, our trade deals are coming along fantastically. The USMCA and South Korea is finished. USMCA has gotten rave reviews. Not going to lose companies anymore to other countries. They're not going to do that, because they have a tremendous economic incentive; it's—meaning, it's prohibitive for them to do that. So it's not going to be like NAFTA, which is one of the worst deals I've ever seen—although we've made some other pretty bad ones too. Now is the time for members of both parties to join together, put partisanship aside, and keep the American economic miracle going strong. It is a miracle. We're doing so well. And I've said it at a lot of rallies. Some of you have probably heard it so much you don't want to hear it again. But when people come to my office—Presidents, Prime Ministers—they all congratulate me, almost the first thing, on what we've done economically. Because it is really amazing.\nAnd our steel industry is back. Our aluminum industry is starting to do really well. These are industries that were dead. Our miners are working again.\nWe must all work together to protect our military—we have to do that—to support our law enforcement, secure our borders, and advance really great policy, including environmental policy. We want crystal-clean water. We want beautiful, perfect air. Air and water, it has to be perfect.\nAt the same time, we don't want to put ourselves at a disadvantage to other countries who are very competitive with us and who don't abide by the rules at all. We don't want to hurt our jobs. We don't want to hurt our factories. We don't want companies leaving. We want to be totally competitive, and we are.\nAnd right now we have just about the cleanest air, the cleanest water we've ever had, and it's always going to be that way. We insist on it. So environmental is very important to me.\nAnd with that, I'll take a few questions if you'd like. Whoa. [Laughter] I didn't know what happened.\nAll right, go ahead, John [John Roberts, Fox News].\nThat was a lot of hands shooting up so quickly. [Laughter]\nThere's a lot to talk about.\nI think there's a good chance, John. I think there's a very good chance that it——\n——will happen.\nWell, then everything is going to come—okay.\nReady? Then, you're going to—if that happens, then we're going to do the same thing, and Government comes to a halt. And I would blame them, because they now are going to be coming up with policy. They're the majority in the House.\nI expect that they will come up with some fantastic ideas that I can support on the environment, on so many different things, including prescription drug prices, which we've made a big dent in already, including some of the things that we're working on for the vets. We've gotten choice approved. We've gotten a lot of things approved. But they have some other elements that we want.\nThere are many things we can get along on without a lot of trouble; that we agree very much with them and they agree with us. I would like to see bipartisanship. I'd like to see unity. And I think we have a very good chance of—and maybe not on everything—but I think we have a very good chance of seeing that.\nGo ahead.\nNot necessarily my last chance.\nLook, I speak to Democrats all the time. They agree that a wall is necessary. A wall is necessary. And as you know, we're building the wall. We've started. But we should build it at one time, not in chunks.\nNo, we need the money to build the wall—the whole wall—not pieces of it all over. And we are doing it. Now we have the military. Now we have other elements of a wall that are pretty nasty, to be honest with you. But it's—nevertheless, it's pretty hard to get through it.\nBut no, I'd like to see the wall. Many of the people that we'll be dealing with, you know, in 2006, they approved the wall, essentially. It was a very strong border fence, but it was the same thing. And they all approved it; they all agreed. I have statements from every one of them. We have them saying, \"We need the wall.\" I mean, they sound like me.\nBut we do need it, because we have people coming—and I'm not just talking about the caravans. We have people coming through our border that you physically can't put that many people. It's a 2,000-mile stretch. You can't put that many people along that stretch to guard it. And even if you did, tremendous fighting would ensue.\nSo we need the wall. Many Democrats know we need the wall. And we're just going to have to see what happens. I mean, I will be fighting for it. They have done everything in their power to make sure we're—I got the military $700 billion and $716 billion. The wall is a tiny, tiny fraction of the cost of that. But their whole agenda has been to try not giving me anything for the wall. I really believe, politically, they're hurting themselves. I actually think, politically, that's a good thing for me. But I want to get the wall up because we need it for security.\nI don't know. I can't tell you that. No, I can't commit to that, but it's possible.\nI'd rather answer that at a little bit different time. We're looking at a lot of different things, including Cabinet. I'm very happy with most of my Cabinet. We're looking at different people for different positions. You know, it's very common after the midterms. I didn't want to do anything before the midterms.\nBut I will tell you that, for the most part, I'm extremely happy with my Cabinet. I think Mike Pompeo has fit in so beautifully. He's done an incredible job as——\nSecretary of the Interior Ryan K. Zinke\nWe're looking at that, and I want—I do want to study whatever is being said. I think he's doing——\nI think he's doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that in a very strong—and we'll probably have an idea about that in about a week.\nOkay? Thank you.\nWow, this is—go ahead, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. He gave me a fair interview the other day, so I might as well ask him a question.\nI think I am an open book. [Laughter]\nWell, look, as I have told you, they're under audit. They have been for a long time. They're extremely complex. People wouldn't understand them. They're done by among the biggest and best law firms in the country. Same thing with the accounting firms. The accountants are—a very, very large, powerful firm, from the standpoint of respect. They're highly respected, big firm. A great law firm. Or you know it very well. They do these things; they put them in. But people don't understand tax returns. Now, I did do a filing of over a hundred pages, I believe, which is in the offices. And when people went and saw that filing and they saw the magnitude of it, they were very disappointed. And they saw the—you know, the detail. You'd get far more from that. And I guess we filed that now three times. But you get far more from that than you could ever get from a tax return.\nBut when you're under audit—and I'm on a very continuous audit, because there are so many companies, and it is a very big company—far bigger than you would even understand. But it's a great company, but it's big, and it's complex. And it's probably feet high. It's a very complex instrument.\nAnd I think that people wouldn't understand it. But if I were finished with the audit, I would have an open mind to it. I would say that. But I don't want to do it during the audit. And really, no lawyer—even from the other side, they say often—not always—but when you're under audit, you don't have—you don't subject it to that. You get it done, and then you release it.\nSo when that happens, if that happens, I would certainly have an open mind to it.\nWhen it's under audit—no, nobody would. Nobody turns over a return when it's under audit, okay?\nThank you. Yes, go ahead. Please.\nWhy do I like Oprah? [Laughter] What kind of a question is that?\nHe's a comedian here.\nI do like Oprah, by the way. I do. She was a person I knew well. Came to my place in Palm Beach often. And I have a lot of respect for her. Unfortunately, she didn't do the trick.\nNo. Negotiation. Not at all.\nOh, yes. Better than them.\nAnd I think I know more than they know.\nNo.\nNo. If they do that, then it's just—all it is, is a warlike posture.\nYes, go ahead.\nYou heard my answer. Go ahead.\nHere we go.\nLet's go. Let's go. Come on.\nI consider it to be an invasion.\nThank you for telling me that. I appreciate it. [Laughter]\nBecause I consider it an invasion. You and I have a difference of opinion.\nNot at all. No, not at all.\nI want them to come into the country, but they have to come in legally. You know, they have to come in, Jim, through a process. I want it to be a process.\nAnd I want people to come in. And we need the people.\nWait. Wait. Wait. You know why we need the people, don't you? Because we have hundreds of companies moving in. We need the people.\nWell, that's true. They weren't actors.\nYou know what?\n——and if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.\nOkay, that's enough.\nOkay, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News], go ahead.\n[At this point, CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta continued to address the President.]\nThat's enough. That's enough. That's enough.\nThat's enough. That's enough.\n[A White House aide attempted to take the microphone from Mr. Acosta, who continued to speak as follows.]\nExcuse me, that's enough.\nPeter, let's go.\n[Mr. Acosta continued to address the President.]\nI'm not concerned about anything with the Russia investigation, because it's a hoax.\nThat's enough. Put down the mike.\nI'll tell you what: CNN should be ashamed of itself having you working for them. You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN.\nGo ahead.\n[NBC News National Correspondent Peter Alexander began to address the President.]\nYou're a very rude person. The way you treat Sarah Huckabee is horrible. And the way you treat other people are horrible. You shouldn't treat people that way.\nGo ahead. Go ahead, Peter. Go ahead.\nWell, I'm not a big fan of yours either. So you know. [Laughter]\nTo be honest with you.\nYou aren't. You aren't the best.\nOkay, just sit down, please.\nNo. When you report fake news, which CNN does a lot, you are the enemy of the people.\nGo ahead.\n[Mr. Acosta continued to address the President off mike, and Mr. Alexander continued as follows.]\nBecause they're very weak on crime.\nExcuse me. Peter. Peter, what, are you trying to be him?\nPeter, just let me just—let me just tell you, very simple: Because they're very weak on crime. Because they have often suggested—members and people within the Democrat Party, at a high level—have suggested getting rid of ICE, getting rid of law enforcement. That's not going to happen, okay?\nWe want to be strong on the borders. We want to be strong on law enforcement. And I want to cherish ICE because ICE does a fantastic job.\nThe—what they do for us is so—really, it's so unrecognized how good a job they do.\nSo we want to take care of them, and we want to hold them very close because they do a good job.\nOkay, yes, go ahead.\nThank you very much. Sit. Sit down, Peter.\nI'm not.\nNo, I'm not. Well, look, I'll tell you what: We won a lot of elections last night. We did very well last night, and I think it's going to have——\nI think it's going to have a very positive impact. I watched NBC this morning; they didn't report it exactly correctly, but that's, you know, very, very—that's the fact with NBC. Nothing I can do about that.\nBut I want this country to have protection. We want security in our country. I want security, Peter. I mean, you maybe don't think it's so important. And I think when you don't have it, you are indeed unleashing crime. I feel that.\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nYou will answer—you'll ask me that question a little bit later.\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead. Sure.\nIt's been a long time.\nI could have ended it anytime I wanted. I didn't. And there was no collusion. There was no anything. I didn't.\nThey went after hackers in Moscow. I don't know about that. They went after people with tax problems, from years ago. They went after people with loans and other things. Had nothing to do with my campaign.\nThis is a investigation where many, many millions of dollars has been spent. And there's no collusion. It was supposed to be on collusion. There's no collusion. And I think it's very bad for our country, I will tell you. I think it's a shame.\nAnd a poll came out today—by the way, from NBC—or at least, I saw it on NBC—where a majority of the people do not agree with the Mueller investigation, or it wasn't approved. They have approval and disapproval, and it had a much higher disapproval.\nIt should end, because it's very bad for our country. It's——\nAnd I'm not just talking about the tremendous expense. And the other thing is, they should look at the other side also. They only look at one side. They're not looking at all of the things that came up during this investigation. They don't do that.\nThey should also get people that can be fair, not 13 or 14 or 17, I call them the \"Angry Democrats.\" They are angry people. And it's a very unfair thing for this country. It's a very, very—forget about unfair to me; it's very bad for our country.\nGo ahead. No, no, no. Please.\nGive him the mike, please. I've answered the question.\nGo ahead, take the—take the mike.\nWell, I'll give you voter—I will give you voter suppression. You just have to—sit down, please.\nSit down. I didn't call you. I didn't call you. I didn't call you.\nI'll give you voter suppression: Take a look at the CNN polls, how inaccurate they were. That's called voter suppression.\nGo ahead, please.\nI'm not responding. I'm responding to——\nExcuse me, I'm not responding to you. I'm talking to this gentleman. Will you please sit down?\nExcuse me. Excuse me. Would you please sit down?\nPlease, go ahead.\nVery hostile. It's such a hostile media. It's so sad. You ask me about——\nNo. You rudely interrupted him.\nYou rudely interrupted him.\nGo ahead.\nI think we could really do something having to do with DACA. And what really happened with DACA—we could have done some pretty good work on DACA. But a judge ruled that DACA was okay. Had the judge not ruled that way, I think we would have made a deal. Once the judge ruled that way, the Democrats didn't want to talk anymore. So it'll see—we'll see how it works out at the Supreme Court.\nGo ahead.\nFrom where?\nYes, go ahead. Go ahead.\nGo ahead. Which group? Where do you want me to take a question from? Go ahead, ma'am. Go ahead. Take the——\nEither one. Either one.\nOr both. Are you together? Go ahead.\nI don't think it has been at all.\nI don't understand what you're saying to me. What?\nWell, that question—I can only say this: If you look at the employment and unemployment numbers for African Americans, for Asian Americans, for Hispanic Americans, they're at a historic high. A poll came out recently where my numbers with Hispanics and with African Americans are the highest—the best they've ever been. That had—that took place 2 or 3 days ago, the poll.\nI have the best numbers with African American and Hispanic American that I've ever had before. And you saw the same poll. So I can say that. I can say this: You look at median income, you look at all of the employment and unemployment numbers, they're doing the best they've ever done. And it reflects—it really is very reflective in the polls.\nYes, go ahead.\nYes. I understand you very well.\nWell, first of all, what we're doing—and we're—if you look at the Department of Labor also—Secretary separately—Secretary Azar, what they've done. They've come up with some incredible health care plans, which is causing great competition and driving the prices right down.\nBut we are getting rid of the individual mandate, because it was very unfair to a lot of people. But at the same time, we're covering the people that need it. But the individual mandate was a disaster, because people that couldn't necessarily afford it were having to pay for the privilege of not having to pay for health care. And it was bad health care at that.\nSo we are working many plans for health care. We're creating tremendous competition. We had Obamacare repealed and replaced. Unfortunately, one person changed his mind at the last moment. And we had no Democrat support. I have to say that. We didn't have one vote. We would have repealed it, replaced it. We would have had a large-scale, very good health care plan. Now we're doing it a different way. We're doing it a different way.\nBut getting rid of the individual mandate is a very, very popular thing and a very important thing. And people very much appreciate it.\nGo ahead.\nNo, no. That's enough.\nGo ahead, please.\nWell, I think the results that I've learned, and maybe confirm, I think people like me. I think people like the job I'm doing, frankly. Because if you look at every place I went to do a rally, I couldn't do it with everybody. But—and it was very hard to do it with people in Congress because there are just too many—it will be too many stops.\nBut I did it with the Senate. I did it with Andy Barr, as you know. And he won. He won a very tough race against McGrath. That was a very, very tough race in Kentucky, and he was down quite a bit. And I went there, and we had a tremendous, very successful—some of you were at that rally. And he won that race. But I could only do that so much, because there are just so many players involved. But I did focus on the Senate, and we had tremendous success with the Senate. Really tremendous success.\nWell, I haven't asked him, but I hope so. Where are you? [Laughter] Mike, will you be my running mate? [Laughter] Huh? Stand up, Mike, please. Raise your right hand. No, I'm only kidding. [Laughter] Will you? Thank you, okay good. The answer is \"yes.\" Okay?\nThat was unexpected, but I feel very fine.\nYes, please.\nI could. I could fire everybody right now. But I don't want to stop it, because politically, I don't like stopping it.\nIt's a disgrace. It should have never been started because there was no crime. It is—everybody has conflicts. They all have conflicts over there that are beyond anything that anybody has ever seen in terms of conflicts: from the fact that people ask for jobs; from the fact that they have very good friends on the other side, like really good friends, like Comey—who, by the way, lied and leaked and also leaked classified information. Nothing happened there. It might, perhaps. Maybe something is happening that I don't know about.\nI stay away from it. But you know what I do? I let it just go on. They're wasting a lot of money, but I let it go on, because I don't want to do that. But you're right: I could end it right now. I could say that investigation is over.\nBut it's really—it's a disgrace, frankly. And it's an embarrassment to our country. It's an embarrassment to the people of our country. And it's too bad.\nGo ahead.\nWell, we're looking at that.\nNo, no. We're looking at that very seriously. Declassification? We're looking at that very seriously.\nIt's amazing how people on the other side just don't want those documents declassified. But no, we're looking at that very carefully. I certainly wanted to wait until after the midterms.\nGo ahead.\nThat's right. Tough.\nVery tough issue.\nJust going to push. I've been pushing. I've done a very good job too. They're very happy with me. But it's a tough issue for the two sides. There's no question about it.\nThere is great division—what am I going to do? I won't be able to explain that to you, because it is an issue that is a very divisive, polarizing issue. But there is a solution. I think I have that solution, and nobody else does.\nWe're going to be working on that.\nYes, go ahead, please. She took your place, but that's okay.\nThe farm bill is working really well. I mean, we could have had it approved any time. But we're looking to get work rules approved. The farmers want it. I'd like it. The problem is, the Democrats are not giving us the 10 votes that we need.\nWe are—everybody wants it. The farmers want it. But the Democrats are not approving the farm bill with work rules. We could have it very fast without the work rules, but we want the work rules in, and the Democrats just don't want to vote for that. So, at some point, they'll have to pay maybe a price.\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.\nThank you very much.Efforts To Combat Foreign Interference in 2018 Congressional Elections\nWell, we've going—we're going to make a full report. And unlike the previous administration, we've done a lot of work on that issue. And if you look—speak with the FBI, speak with the Department of Justice, speak to Homeland Security, we've spent a lot of time. It gets very little coverage in the papers. I mean, you cover the nonsense part, but you don't cover the important. This is very important.\nAnd we have been working very hard on China and Russia and everybody else looking into our elections or meddling with our elections. But people tend not to write about it. But we have worked very hard, as you probably heard.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Russia-U.S. Relations/Russia's Annexation of Crimea\nWell, I have a good relationship with both. I know President Xi better. But I think I have a very good relationship with both. I actually had a very good meeting in Russia that you people didn't agree with, but that's okay. It doesn't much matter, obviously. Because here I am.\nBut the fact is that I had a very, very good meeting—a very, very good meeting—with President Putin, and a lot was discussed about security, about Syria, about Ukraine, about the fact that President Obama allowed a very large part of Ukraine to be taken. And right now you have submarines off that particular parcel that we're talking about. You know what I'm talking about.\nThat was President Obama's regime. That was during President Obama, right? That was not during me. No, that was President Obama——\nNo, no. It was President Obama that allowed it to happen. It had nothing to do with me.\nOkay, go ahead. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nI'll be honest: I thought it was a very-close-to-complete victory. When you look at it from the standpoint of negotiation, when you look at it from the standpoint of deal making—because it's all about deal making—again, if we had the majority, and we had one or two or three votes to play with, we would never—we would have been at a standstill.\nI really believe that we have a chance to get along very well with the Democrats. And if that's the case, we can do a tremendous amount of legislation and get it approved by both parties. So I consider it to be—hey, look, I won Georgia. President Obama campaigned very hard in Georgia. Oprah Winfrey campaigned very, very hard. All over the television. I said this is going to be tough. I only had me. I didn't have anybody else. And I went to Georgia, and we had one of the largest crowds that anybody here has seen, ever, at a political rally. And you know what? He won. And he won actually by, you know, a pretty good margin. He won.\nAnd then, we went to Florida, and they had celebrities all over the place. And a man, who happens to be very smart person, was running: Ron DeSantis. And people didn't give him a chance. And I went, and we had—we did some great work. And they're going to have a great Governor of the State of Florida.\nAnd then, we talked about the Senate, and a lot of money was pouring in for the Democrat. This is a man who's been in office for like 44 years or something. This is man who was like a professional at getting elected and being in office. So he's not—Bill Nelson—not easy to beat. Okay? And—but they had a lot of celebrities coming out for Nelson. They had everybody coming out for Nelson. And Rick Scott won. And I helped him.\nAnd I think we've done an amazing job. And you could look at many other places—you just take a look at some of the other places. And we just got the word that, in Iowa, you have a Governor who just got extended, who's—Kim just got extended. And numerous other places.\nI think it was a great victory. I'll be honest: I think it was a great victory. And actually, some of the news this morning was that it was, in fact, a great victory.\nBut if you look at it from the standpoint of gridlock, I really believe there's going to be much less gridlock because of the way this is going, than any other way.\nSit down, please.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nWell, it could be. You know that this will have to be now proposed. Because if we did it now, we don't have the votes in the Senate. You don't have—we need—we would need 10 Democrat votes; we probably couldn't get them. If we could, we could pass it very easily in the House. But there's no reason to waste time, because you don't have the votes in the Senate.\nBut if the—as an example, if the Democrats come up with an idea for tax cuts, which I'm a big believer in tax cuts, I would absolutely pursue something even if it means some adjustment.\nSome adjustment, yes, to make it possible. But I would love to see a tax cut for the middle class. Now, that's going to be their decision. They're going to have to make that decision.\nAs you know, if we bring it up to the Senate, we'd need Democrat votes—10—and we don't have those 10 votes.\nOh, I'm not telling you that. I'm just saying, I would be certainly willing to do a little bit of an adjustment.\nGo ahead. Behind. You. Go ahead, please.\nWorld War I Centennial Commemoration in Paris, France/Russia-U.S. Relations\nWell, as I understand it, we're having—and I guess a lot of you are going over. We're having a lunch for numerous countries. I'll be there. I believe President Putin is going to be there. We don't have anything scheduled. I don't think we have anything scheduled in Paris. And I'm coming back very quickly.\nWe're going over—there's a great event. This is an important—really, it's going to be very important and, I think, a very beautiful ceremony. I'm looking forward to going. And we're representing the incredible heroes of the world, but the heroes of our country from World War I. And so I'll be going there, and I am very proud to go there.\nI don't think we have time set aside for that meeting.\nNow, with that being said, we're very shortly meeting again at the G-20, where he'll be there, and I'll be there. And that's where we're actually looking forward to meeting.\nWe will be having a lunch, but I think there are many people there.\nPotential White House Personnel Changes/The President's Cabinet/White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly\nWell, I think what I'll do is—as we make changes, we'll sit down and talk to you about it. No, I mean, there's no great secret. A lot of administrations make changes after midterms. I will say that, for the most part, I'm very, very happy with this Cabinet. We're doing a great job.\nWell, that's okay. But no, people leave. People leave.\nPeople leave. I haven't heard about John Kelly.\n[Many reporters began asking questions. The President continued as follows.]\nBut no, people—people leave. They come in, they're here. It's a very exhausting job. Although, I love doing it, I must tell you. But it's exhausting for a lot of people. I'm surprised that a lot of people. They start off, they're young people, they're there for 2 years, and they're old by the time they leave. [Laughter] It's quite exhausting. But I love doing it.\nAnd I'll tell you, there will be changes. Nothing monumental from that standpoint. I don't think very much different than most administrations. But—and we have—I mean, we have many people lined up for every single position. Any position. Everybody wants to work in this White House. We are a hot country. This is a hot White House. [Laughter] We are a White House that people want to work with.\nIt's been a very challenging campaign. That's true.\nRight.\nIt's a very fair question. Look, I would love to see unity and peace and love and any other word you want to use. And obviously, I think we had to, especially at this particular juncture, we had to wait until after the midterms are over. Now they're over.\nIf they would cover me fairly—which they don't. Which they don't. I'm not saying that in a hostile way. I get extremely inaccurate coverage. I can do something that's fantastic, and they'll make it look like not good. And I don't mind being—having bad stories. I make a mistake, cover it. I would like you to cover it fairly, but cover it.\nBut when you do something terrific—look how little the economy is talked about. A poll came out this morning talking about how little the three networks—I don't think they included CNN—but how little the three networks talk about how good the economy is. How little. Almost not at all.\nIf President Obama had this economy—and by the way, if that administration, through somebody else, kept going, you would have had negative-4.2- instead of positive-4.2-percent growth. You would have had negative. It was heading down. But here—the point is this——\nExcuse me. I would love to see unity, including with the media. Because I think the media—I'll be honest: I think it's a very divisive thing for our country. And you would be amazed at how smart people are that are reading your stories and seeing your stories and watching. You would be amazed how perceptive and how smart they are. They get it. And it really does bring disunity.\nExcuse me. You are not called on.\nGo ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead, please.\nSay it? You have to speak up.\nWell, God plays a big factor in my life, and God plays a factor in the lives of many people that I know very well in this room, like your Vice President.\nGod plays a very big role in my life.\nNothing surprises me in politics.\nBut there were some losses last night. And there were some victories last night that have been incredible. I mean, there were victories last night that nobody would believe, especially based on the suppression polls. They had a lot of suppression polls.\nAnd there were some victories last night that were very surprising, but I'm not going to pick out special—you know, special people.\nIt's tough enough for those people to have a loss.\nWould I what? What?\nI know a couple of very good ones. Yes, I would, actually.\nGo ahead, please.\nI would love to have—I'd be very good at a low tone. But when things are done not correctly about you—written about you, said about you on television, on wherever it is—you have to defend yourself.\nI would love to do very—a very even tone. It's much easier than what I have to do. I have to go around. And going around is much easier than facing somebody and being treated fairly. But when you're not treated fairly, you really have no choice.\nI would love to have a very even, modest, boring tone. I would be very honored by that. But you know what? When you have to fight—all the time fight—because you're being misrepresented by the media, you really can't do that.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWhere are you from, please?\nOkay. Say hello. Say hello to Shinzo. [Laughter]\nI'm sure he's happy about tariffs on his cars. [Laughter] Go ahead.\nI don't—I really don't understand you.\nTrade with Japan?\nWell, we're dealing with Japan right now on trade. Japan has—it's a great country. You have a great Prime Minister who just had a very successful election.\nHe's a very good friend of mine. He's one of the people I'm closest with. And—but I tell him all the time that Japan does not treat the United States fairly on trade. They send in millions of cars at a very low tax. They don't take our cars. And if they do, they have a massive tax on the cars.\nJapan—and I'm not blaming Japan; I'm blaming the people that were in charge of the United States for allowing that to happen. But as you know, we have close to $100 billion trade deficit with Japan. And Japan has treated us very unfairly. But don't feel lonely, because you weren't the only one.\nNo, we're going to change it, because of trips that are being made. We're going to make it at another date. But we're very happy how it's going with North Korea. We think it's going fine. We're in no rush. We're in no hurry. The sanctions are on.\nNo, no. Listen. Excuse me. Wait.\nThe sanctions are on. The missiles have stopped. The rockets have stopped. The hostages are home. The great heroes have been coming home.\nMike Pence was in Hawaii, where the—one of the most beautiful ceremonies that anyone has ever seen for the fallen. These are great heroes. Very important. When I was running, a lot of people—as many years ago as it was—in many cases, grandchildren—but they were asking about that. They're coming home, and they're being provided to us as we speak.\nBut I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush. The sanctions are on. I read a couple of times, and I've seen a few times where they said, \"He's done so much.\" What have I done? I met.\nNow, I'd love to take the sanctions off. But they have to be responsive too. It's a two-way street. But we're not in any rush at all. There's no rush whatsoever. You know, before I got here, they were dealing with this for over 70 years. And I guess, on a nuclear front, for 25 years. That's a long time.\nI've been there; I probably left Singapore 4 or 5 months ago. And we made more progress in that 4 or 5 months than they've made in 70 years. And nobody else could have done what I've done.\nBut I'll say this. I'll say this very simply: We're in no rush. The sanctions are on. And whenever it is—but that meeting is going to be rescheduled.\nSometime next year, I would say.\nSometime early next year. Yes.\nCanada-U.S. Relations\nYes, I have. We have a very good relationship.\nTrue. That's true.\nIt's very sad to see it. I hate to see it. And, as you know, I've done more—in fact, if you were with us the last time we met, Prime Minister Netanyahu said that, \"This President has done more for Israel than any other President.\" Those words. Those exact words.\nJerusalem, protection, working together—so many different things. But the big thing is Jerusalem. You know, many, many Presidents have said they are going to build the Embassy in Jerusalem. Never happened. Making it the capital of Israel—never happened. Never happened. But it happened with me and quickly.\nAnd not only did it happen, we built the Embassy. That would have taken another 15 or 20 years and cost probably billions of dollars, and we did it for a tiny amount of money. It's already done. It's open.\nNobody has done more for Israel than Donald Trump. And the nice part is that's not me saying it; that's Prime Minister Netanyahu.\nWell, we want to see it healed. And one of the things I think that can help heal is the success of our country. We are really successful now. We've gone up $11.7 trillion in worth.\nIf you know, China has come down tremendously. Tremendously. China would have superseded us in 2 years as an economic power; now, they're not even close. China got rid of their \"China '25\" because I found it very insulting. I said that to them. I said, \"China '25\" is very insulting, because \"China '25\" means, in 2025, they're going to take over, economically, the world. I said, \"That's not happening.\"\nAnd we've gone way up. They've gone down. And I don't want them to go down. We'll have a good meeting, and we're going to see what we can do. But I have to say this: Billions of dollars will soon be pouring into our Treasury from taxes that China is paying for us. And if you speak to Mr. Pillsbury, who probably is the leading authority on China, he was on the other day saying he has never seen anything like it. And you know who else hasn't? China hasn't.\nBut we're going to try and make a deal with China because I want to have great relationships with President Xi, as I do, and also with China.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nGo ahead, please.\nGo ahead, please. Please, please.\nPlease, please. Go ahead. There's so many people, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nI think I am a great moral leader, and I love our country.\nGo ahead, please.\nNo, I think it's inappropriate—no, no. I think it's very inappropriate. We should get along and get deals done. Now, we can investigate. They look at us. We look at them. It goes on for 2 years. Then, at the end of 2 years, nothing is done. Now, what's bad for them is, being in the majority, I'm just going to blame them. You understand. I'm going to blame them. They're the majority.\nHonestly, it makes it much simpler for me. I—they will be blamed. But I think Nancy Pelosi—and you know, I put that statement out on social media today about Nancy Pelosi that, if she's short of votes—because frankly, I think she deserves—and a lot of people thought I was being sarcastic or I was kidding. I wasn't.\nI think she deserves it. She's been fighting long for it. She's been fighting—I really mean this. This—there was nothing sarcastic about it or—it was really meant in—with very good intentions. I think she deserves it. She's fought long and hard. She's a very capable person. And you know, you have other people shooting at her, trying to take over the Speakership.\nAnd I said, if—if it's appropriate—I said, if we can and if we will, if she has a problem, I think I would be able to very easily supply her the necessary votes.\nThat's not said in any way other than I really believe she deserves that position. I also believe that Nancy Pelosi and I can work together and get a lot of things done, along with Mitch and everybody else that we have to work with. I think we'll get a lot done.\nOkay, go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nExcuse me?\nI think we will. Look, now that the election is over—the election is over. Now everybody is in love. But then, I see the hostility of questions in the room. I come in here as a nice person wanting to answer questions, and I have people jumping out of their seats, screaming questions at me.\nNo, the election is over. And I'm, you know, very—I am extraordinarily happy. I really am. And by the way, I'd tell you if I wasn't.\nLook at what happened in Florida. Look at what happened in Georgia. Look at what happened in so many locations with Governorships. Nobody talks about the Governorships. Look at the amount of work that was given to these other candidates against my candidate.\nAnd, I mean, I'm extraordinarily happy. And if I wasn't, I'd let you know. There's nothing wrong. I mean, look, you look at midterms and you look at elections—elections generally—you see it's very rare that a party who has the Presidency does well. We did unbelievably well. To win Florida, both the Senate and the Governorship against two very talented people.\nI'll tell you what: We did incredibly. To win Georgia, where you had some of the biggest stars in the world campaigning endlessly, including President Obama. You know, I'm—I'll tell you what: This was a great victory for us. And again, from a deal-making standpoint, we are all much better off the way it turned out. Because I really believe, if the Democrats want to, we can do a tremendous amount of great legislation.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nShould we keep this going for a little while?\nYou know what, when you get bored, would you please tell me? Seriously, tell me. I don't want to——\nOh, no. Hopefully, not. I don't want to overstay. But yes, please. Go ahead.\nI don't know why you'd say that. That's such a racist question.\nOh, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.\nI don't believe—well, I don't know. Why do I have my highest poll numbers ever with African Americans? Why do I have among the highest poll numbers with African Americans? I mean, why do I have my highest poll numbers? That's such a racist question.\nHonestly, I mean, I know you have it written down, and you're going to tell me. Let me tell you: That's a racist question.\nI love—and you know what the word is? I love our country. I do. You call—you have nationalists. You have globalists. I also love the world, and I don't mind helping the world, but we have to straighten out our country first. We have a lot of problems.\nExcuse me. But to say that—what you said is so insulting to me. It's a very terrible thing that you said.\nOkay. Please, go ahead. Go ahead.\nExcuse me.\nYou have to ask them.\nExcuse me.\nYou know what my plan is? You know what my plan is? I'll ask them. And if they say yes, I'm all for it. And if they say no, there's nothing you can do, because you need their votes.\nGo ahead.\nIt's not a question of want. I would've—so let me answer it a little—would I have preferred winning by two or three or four? I would almost have to think about that. But certainly, I like to win. And if I win, she's not going to be Speaker.\nWe had a great conversation.\nHonestly, we had a very warm conversation. You know, she loves this country. And she's a very smart woman. She's done a very good job. She was really—I mean, she's had a very——\nShe's had a very, very—we didn't talk about impeaching. We didn't talk about—what do you do? Do you impeach somebody because he created the greatest economic success in the history of our country? \"Let's impeach him, because the country is so successful. Let's impeach him.\" \"Has he done anything wrong?\" They asked somebody, \"Has he done anything wrong?\" \"No, but let's impeach him anyway.\"\nAnd they also said: \"Let's impeach Justice Kavanaugh. Let's impeach him.\" And now they have the second woman coming out that—the first or second. And I hate to say this, but it was public. \"And after him, we're going to impeach the Vice President. We're going to impeach Mike Pence.\" Mike Pence doesn't get impeached for anything. [Laughter] \"So let's impeach the President, and then we'll impeach the Vice President.\"\nThese people are sick. And you know what? They have to get their bearing. Really, they have to get their bearing. And when you ask about division, they're the ones that cause the division. They cause tremendous division.\nRetirements Among Republican Members of Congress/Senator Jeffrey L. Flake\nWho is retiring?\nMany retirements, yes.\nIn Jeff Flake's case, it's me. Pure and simple. I retired him. [Laughter] I'm very proud of it. I did the country a great service.\nGo ahead. Give him that—[laughter]. Give him that—he is retired. I'd like to call it another word, but we're going to treat him with great respect.\nGo ahead.\nJeff Flake. That's another beauty. [Laughter]\nGo ahead.\nNo, one. One. One. One. Too many people. Sorry.\nNo. No.\nNo. You know, when I don't do the—I think Sarah is fantastic. Where is Sarah? Where is Sarah? Sarah is so great. I think, Sarah, you've represented me so well and been abused. She's been horribly treated by a lot of people.\nNo, no. It's very interesting because Sarah was telling—we were talking about it the other day.\nSo I had a period where I figured, you know what I'll do? I won't do any real interviews. And then, they start saying, \"Why doesn't he do—why?\" And they're all coming up with all kinds—Then, over the last couple of months, I decided, I'll do a lot—we'll stop at the helicopter, we'll do this, we'll do a lot of—and then they say: \"Why is he doing so many press conferences? What's wrong? What?\" So when I don't do them, you say, \"What's wrong?\" When I do do them, you say, \"What's wrong?\" And when I go in the middle, you say, \"What's wrong?\" But in the media—you know that, John. Right?\nYou're sort of right.\nOkay, good.\nNo, no. You did. Excuse me. Well, you complained about access when I purposely just stayed away from the press for a while, because I wanted to see how it worked. And can I be honest with you? It didn't work well. It didn't work well.\nOkay, please. Go ahead. No. Go ahead.\nI do, too. Actually? I do, too.\nIt's called \"earned media.\" It's worth billions. Go ahead. [Laughter]\nI know it. Sure. But I didn't say it prevented me, I said lawyers will tell you not to do it. Go ahead. What's your next question? Go ahead.\nCome on. Let's go. More exciting question than that, please.\nThat's false.\nThat's false.\nI don't know who Little Jon is. I don't—I really don't.\nI don't know. Oh, he was? Okay. Oh, I see. I don't know.\nNo. No, I would never do that, and I don't use racist remarks. And you know what? If I did, you people have—you would've known about it. I've been hearing there are tapes. For years and years, \"There are tapes.\"\nNumber one, I never worried about it, because I never did. I never used racist remarks. I have never used racist remarks.\nGo ahead.\nQuiet. Quiet.\nQuiet. Quiet.\nGo ahead.\nSee, when you talk about division, it's people like this that cause division. Great division.\nGreat—no. No, point of fact is that I never used a racist remark. That's the point of fact.\nWhere—who are you from?\nYahoo!—oh, Yahoo!—oh, good. Good, I hope they're doing well.\nWhere are you from?\nLebanon. Good.\nWho said that?\nI know. I know.\nSo let me just say about the oil, okay? So we're—we imposed, just recently, the strongest sanctions in the history of our country, just about. Although, I guess North Korea is there too. But I gave some countries a break on the oil. I did it a little bit because they really asked for some help. But I really did it because I don't want to drive oil prices up to $100 a barrel or $150 a barrel, because I'm driving them down.\nIf you look at oil prices, they've come down very substantially over the last couple of months. That's because of me. Because you have a monopoly called OPEC. And I don't like——\nWait! And I don't like that monopoly. I don't like it. And oil prices are coming down.\nSo rather than deciding to be as tough as I am on most of the sanctions, what I've done is, I said, we're not going to do it that way; we're going to let some of the oil go out to these countries that really do need it, because I don't want to drive the oil prices up to $100 or $150 a barrel, which could happen very easily. It's a very fragile market. Very, very fragile. I know it very well. And it's the absolute right decision.\nAnd they'll get tougher as time goes by—maybe—but I don't want to have any effect on the oil prices worldwide, where I drive them up. Because I consider that to be a tax, and I don't like taxes.\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead. Please. Please.\nWho?\nOh, congratulations to Jon Tester. Congratulations. I'm sure you're very unhappy about that.\nGo ahead.\nYes. Please, go ahead.\nWe'll take a couple of more, and then we'll go.\nDo you think that's the reason that the candidate lost?\nWell, I mean, look, I wasn't involved in Georgia. I wasn't.\nOther than I love the State. I do love the State.\nI heard it was very efficient in Georgia. I heard it was very efficient. But again, you'd have to ask the State governments, because—just one of those things you're going to have to ask them.\nYes, go ahead. Please. Please, go ahead.\nI would do that, yes. I would look at that very seriously. I think it's a serious problem. At the same time, you start getting into speech; that's a very dangerous problem. That could be the beginning. So it's very dangerous.\nBelieve it or not, I'm one that really likes free speech. A lot of people don't understand that. But I am a big believer. And when you start regulating, a lot of bad things can happen.\nBut I would certainly talk to the Democrats if they want to do that. And I think they do want to do that.\nYes, sir. Go ahead.\nI do. I do. I think that some of it I can use executive power—on some. Not all. But I got—I mean, he certainly used it. He used it on DACA. And when he did it, he said something to the effect that \"I'm not allowed to do this, it will never hold up, but I'm doing it anyway.\" And he did it, and they found judges that approved it. We also found judges that didn't approve it, so it's obviously going to be determined in the Supreme Court.\nAnd if the Supreme—if the Court rules in favor of what President Obama thinks they should rule—which is what he said—then I will probably have a deal with the Democrats in a very short period of time. We were very close to having a deal until we got that very strange ruling.\nWhich one are you talking about?\nWe are looking at it very seriously. Absolutely.\nAnd I believe we have the absolute right. But that's another case that will be determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\nDeployment of U.S. Armed Forces Personnel to Mexico-U.S. Border\nYou've been reading the same documents as I have; you know exactly what I'm doing. You know exactly what I'm doing.\nSo go ahead. What's your next question?\nYes. Very sad thing. Very terrible thing.\nI'll have a much stronger opinion on that subject over the next week, and I'm working very closely with Congress. We're working together. Some very talented people. And we're working with Congress, we're working with Turkey, and we're working with Saudi Arabia. And I'm forming a very strong opinion.\nGo ahead, Jon. Go ahead, Jon.\nNo.\nNo.\nWell, I believe that. I believe that. With their current policy, they are using a wrecking ball on our country. I believe that a hundred percent. This would be a wrecking ball. But I think there's a compromise somewhere, and I think that could be really good for our country.\nOkay, how about one more?\nNo, I don't. No. No. No.\nDo I regret it?\nI'm surprised you'd ask me that question. I do not.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes, I do. I do believe that's a problem.\nI believe all hate is a problem, but I do believe that is a problem.\nAnd it's a problem we want to solve.\nOkay, go ahead.\nNo, we have given funding for that—a lot of funding. But I do believe it's a problem. And can I tell you what? It's a problem that I don't like even a little bit.\nGo ahead.\nI think my message was very well received. I mean, just look at the results. Midterm elections are disasters for sitting Presidents and administrations. This has been a very successful—and look, you can write it any way you want. And if you disagree with me—this has been incredibly successful—when you look at the races. How about Ohio? I didn't even mention. I mentioned Florida; I mentioned Georgia. How about the Governor of Ohio? A fantastic——\nExcuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. A fantastic man, who was down on the polls. And everybody was talking about this person that was so great. And I went up there, and I did a rally, and they have now a great Governor—you're going to have a great Governor in Ohio for, hopefully, a long period of time. But for 4 years. And Mike DeWine is a fantastic person.\nAnd I went up there for two reasons: Because I felt that his opposition was not a good person—and we know a lot about him—and I felt that Mike was a fantastic person. And he won. And not only did he win, he won easily.\nSo add that to Florida and add that to Georgia and add that to all of the other races that we won—outside, even, of the Senate races, which were the biggest of all. Because these were races that—and Mike Pence can tell you, and some of the folks over here can tell you—these were races that were going to be unopposed. We were going to—were not going to oppose certain of the people running, certain Senators. They said they couldn't be beaten. They said Heidi could not be beaten. \"Please, don't do it.\" They couldn't—this was a year out.\nExcuse me. You—no, but you're telling me about—you're telling me about popularity. They said many of these people—when I said 9 out of 11—but I said—when many of these people—these weren't, like, easy races; these were tough races.\nAnd so I think the level of popularity—the first question I was asked was about: \"Well, what have you learned? What about your own popularity?\" I think that's what I learned, is my—I was very well received by this great country, by the people of our great country. And I'm very proud of that, because I love the people of this country. These people—we are the greatest people. I love the people of our country.\nAnd I'll tell you something: When you look at the races that we won in Florida, which we weren't expected to win; and Georgia, which we weren't expected to win; and Ohio, which we weren't expected to win—and won; I mean, you look at some of them—the number of votes that we got is incredible.\nSo I'm really happy with not only the way it came out, but the response to me as your President. And as your President, I've made our country safe. I've rebuilt and am in the process of rebuilding our military. And the jobs are here. Every one of them built here. We're going to have the strongest—very shortly, we're going to have the strongest military our country has ever had.\nI've done more for the vets than any President has done, certainly in many, many decades, with choice and with other things, as you know. With other things.\nBut our vets are doing better than they've ever done. But if you look at choice—choice alone—I mean, just take a look at what we've done with choice. But the people of our country are very happy with the job that I'm doing. And you know, one of the things—\nOne of the things that they want so much is security. They want security, both at the border—they want it with our military; they want it with law enforcement; they want it with ICE.\nYou know, we've taken out thousands of MS-13 gang members—thousands out of our—hard to believe—thousands—out of our country. Women of our country, who are incredible people, they want security; they want safety. They want financial security also. We've done that. But they want physical security.\nAnd we've taken out thousands of people that shouldn't be in this country. But we have to get strong immigration laws so they don't come in. We want laws where they don't come in, where we don't have to take them out, per se.\nAnd again, I'm very honored to be with all of you. It was a great day yesterday. It was a great evening. I think we had a tremendous success. And hopefully, the tone can get better. Hopefully——\nHopefully, the tone can get a lot better. And I really believe it begins with the media. I really believe—we used to call it the \"press.\" But I really——\nBut I really believe it begins with the media. If you would cover—and there was a very interesting story written in a very good paper recently that talked about the fact that it isn't good what the media is doing and that I do have the right to fight back, because I'm treated very unfairly.\nSo I do fight back. And I'm fighting back not for me; I'm fighting back for the people of this country.\nThank you all very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-washington-dc"}
{"Title": "Interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News", "Date": "2018-11-18", "Text": "There's nothing like it in the world.\nThank you Chris, very much.\nRight.\nRight.\nIt's very light, it's fake news. It's disgusting fake news.\nI read a front page here in The Washington Post, they never even called me, nobody ever calls me. You know, they hear -- I don't even think they have sources I think they just make it up like it's fiction.\nAnd I will tell you I'm extremely upbeat, the White House is running like a well-oiled machine, it's doing really well, I have great people. I will make some changes but not very many.\nI'm very happy with my cabinet, other than, you know a couple of exceptions and even then I'm not unhappy. And I will tell you that it's so wrong, the reporting about me is so wrong. I'm loving what I'm doing, I did well in France, I did have a problem where I wasn't able to go to a cemetery because the Secret Service would not let me do it.\nNo, but I'm just saying the Secret Service would not let me do it and they made it a big deal.\nWell, I didn't know the advisor well, really, and I know they had a lot of problems. My wife did a great job in Africa and she was not treated properly by the press. She really worked so hard.\nThey came to me. They wanted to go a little bit public because that's the way they felt and I thought it was fine.\nI met with Mira two days ago and we're going to move her around. She was with me for a long time, although I don't know her. She's really somebody I don't know very well. But we're going to move her around because she's got certain talents.\nBut, frankly, she is not -- she'll never be put in the United Nations, let me put it that way.\nShe's not too diplomatic, but she's talented.\nWell, I like her a lot. I respect her a lot. She's very smart.\nI want her to get much tougher and we'll see what happens there. But I want to be extremely tough.\nWell there's a chance. But there's a chance everybody -- I mean, that's what happens in government you leave, you make a name, you go. The people that have left have done very well. The people that have left have done very well -- from my White House.\nI like her very much. I respect her very much. I'd like her to be much tougher on the border -- much tougher, period.\nWe -- I wouldn't -- look, we get along well. There are certain things I love what he does. And there are certain things that I don't like that he does -- that aren't his strength. It's not that he doesn't do -- you know, he works so hard.\nHe's doing an excellent job in many ways. There are a couple of things where it's just not his strength. It's not his fault it's not his strength.\nBut I haven't even thought about John in terms of this. But John, at some point, is going to want to move on. John will move on.\nIt could happen. Yes, it could -- I mean it could be. But let's see what happens.\nI have not -- look, I have three or four or five positions that I'm thinking about. Of that, maybe it's going to end up being two. Maybe -- but I want to -- I need flexibility.\nYes.\nI did not know that.\nI did not know he took views on the Mueller investigation as such.\nI don't think it had any effect. If you look at those statements - - those statements that can -- they really can be viewed really either way, but I don't think will have anything --\nWhat do you do when a person's right? There is no collusion. He happened to be right. I mean, he said it.\nSo if he said there is collusion, I'm supposed to be taking somebody that says there is? Because then I wouldn't take him for two reasons, but the number one reason is the fact that he would have been wrong. If he said that there's no collusion, he's right.\nRight.\nLook, he -- it's going to be up to him. I think he's very well aware politically. I think he's astute politically. He's a very smart person. A very respected person. He's going to do what's right. I really believe he's going to do what's right.\nI would not get involved. And all these people that say I'm going to end the investigation, you know, they've been saying that now for -- how long has this witch hunt gone on? It's gone on for, what?\nOK, but how long have I been looked at? You know when I've been looked at? From the day I --\nFrom the day I announced. I was looked at as a candidate with nothing, no proof, with phony people like McCabe and Strzok and his lover - - you had Lisa Page, his lover. These people were looking at me, they wanted an insurance policy just in case I won or Hillary lost, and this was the insurance policy.\nIt's a scam. There was no collusion whatsoever, and the whole thing is a scam.\nNo, no, no, not my team. I'm preparing written answers. My -- I - - I'm the one that does the answering. Yes, are they writing them out?\nYes. They're writing what I tell them to write.\nAt some point very soon, yes.\nI've completed them.\nAnd it wasn't a big deal -- by the way, it wasn't a big deal. The answers -- the questions were asked and answered. It wasn't a big deal.\nYou know, they make it like I had meetings for many, many hours -- I got the questions, I responded, we read them out, I read them once, I read them a second time, we made some changes, that's it. They're very simple.\nYou know why? I did nothing wrong.\nYes.\nWell there was no obstruction of justice.\nI think they'd probably agree with me.\nI think we've wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably, we're finished.\nI don't do odds. We would -- I gave very --\nYou're right, and very successfully actually.\nWe gave very, very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn't have even be asked and I think that should solve the problem, I hope it solves the problem. If it doesn't, you know, I'll be told and we'll make a decision at that time. But probably this is the end.\nRight.\nWe have the tape, I don't want to hear the tape, no reason for me to hear the tape.\nBecause it's a suffering tape, it's a terrible tape. I've been fully briefed on it. There's no reason for me to hear it.\nIn fact I said to the people should I? They said, you really shouldn't, there's no reason. I know exactly - I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it.\nIt was very violent, very vicious and terrible.\nThat's right, that's right and still says that.\nI don't - I don't know. You know, who can really know? But I can say this, he's got many people now that say he had no knowledge.\nYes, he told me that he had nothing to do with it, he told me that -- I would say maybe five times at different points.\nAs recently as a few days ago.\nWell, will anybody really know? All right, will anybody really know?\nBut he did have certainly people that were reasonably close to him and close to him that were probably involved. You saw we put on very heavy sanctions, massive sanctions on a large group of people from Saudi Arabia. But at the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally that in many ways has been very good.\nWell I want to see Yemen in but it takes two to tango. Iran has to end it also. And Iran is a different country than it was when I took over, it's far weakened because of what I did with the Iran -- so-called Iran deal, Iran nuclear deal, which was one of the great rip-offs of all time.\nBut I want Saudi to stop but I want Iran to stop also.\nI won the Senate, you don't mention that.\nAre you ready?\nI won the Senate, and that's historic too, because if you look at presidents in the White House, it's almost never happened where you won a seat. We won -- we now have 53 as opposed to 51 and we have 53 great Senators in the U.S. Senate. We won. That's a tremendous victory. Nobody talks about that.\nThat's a far greater victory than it is for the other side. Number two, I wasn't on the ballot. I wasn't --\nBut I had people and you see the polls, how good they are, I had people that won't vote unless I'm on the ballot, OK? And I wasn't on the ballot.\nAnd almost everybody that I won -- I think they said it was 10 out of 11. And I won against President Obama and Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama in a great state called Georgia for the governor. And it was all stacked against Brian and I was the one that went for Brian and Brian won.\nLook at Florida. I went down to Florida. Rick Scott won and he won by a lot. I don't know what happened to all those votes that disappeared at the very end.\nAnd if I didn't put a spotlight on that election before it got down to the 12,500 votes, he would of lost that election, OK? In my opinion, he would have lost. They would have taken that election away from him.\nRick Scott won Florida. He kept the state.\nExcuse me, a man named Ron DeSantis is now your governor -- your new governor of Florida.\nA wonderful man named DeWine is your governor of the great state of Ohio. Remember what they used to say before my election? You cannot win unless you win Ohio. I won Ohio.\nWe had a tremendous set of victories. You look at the victories --\nI didn't run. I wasn't running. My name wasn't on the ballot.\nThere are many people that think, \"I don't like Congress,\" that like me a lot. I get it all the time; \"Sir, I will never vote unless you were on the ballot.\" I get it all the time.\nPeople are saying, \"Sir, I will never vote unless you're on the ballot. I say, \"No, no, go and vote.\" \"Well, what do you mean?\"\nAs much as I try and convince people to go vote, I'm not on the ballot.\nI -- it's fine, I mean, it's not a big deal.\nWhat they said though was that we have to create rules and regulations for conduct, et cetera, et cetera. We're doing that. We're going to write them up right now, it's not a big deal.\nAnd if he misbehaves, we'll throw him out, or we'll stop the news conference.\nYes, they're doing them now. I mean, we'll have rules of decorum. You know, you can't keep asking questions. You have - we had a lot of reporters in that room, many, many reporters in that room and they were unable to ask questions because this guy gets up and starts doing what he's supposed to be doing for him and for CNN, and, you know, just shouting out questions.\nBut I will say this, look, nobody believes in the First Amendment more than I do and if I think somebody's acting out of sorts, I will leave, I'll say thank you very much, everybody, I appreciate you coming and I'll leave. And those reporters will not be too friendly to whoever it is that's acting up.\nActually, I like to do it but in many cases I don't. He'll stand up. He's unbelievably rude to Sarah Huckabee who's a wonderful woman, unbelievably rude.\nAnd I see that and I actually ask her the same. Why do you call on these people that are so nasty? I think one of the things we'll do is maybe turn the camera off that faces them because then they don't have any air time, although I'll probably be sued for that and maybe win or lose it, who knows? I mean, with this stuff, you never know what's going to happen.\nThat's true, 100 percent. Not the media.\nI'm glad you're finally calling it correctly because they like to leave the fake news.\n-- that are supporting me in particular, they're very smart people. They're hard working, brilliant, great people. They know when the news is fake and they get angry when they see all of the fakeness that I -- frankly --\nChris, I'm calling the fake news is the enemy -- it's fake, it's phony.\nNo, it's not -- no. No, I don't mind getting bad news if I'm wrong. If I do something wrong, like, for instance, the cemetery. I was not allowed to go because of the Secret Service. Because they expected to take a helicopter --\nThey had zero visibility. They said, sir, we are totally unequipped for you to go.\nIn addition to that, the cemetery was far too far away from Air Force One, which is sort of like a control center where you had to be near.\nNot one paper that I saw wrote it that way. They said I stayed out of it because of the rain. And yet, the following day, I made a speech at the American cemetery.\nIt was pouring. It wasn't even really raining the first day but the fog was tremendous. OK?\nI can't talk for other people, I can only talk for me. I will tell you --\nChris -- Chris, I'm not talking about you -- but you sometimes maybe. But I'm not talking about you.\nThe news about me is largely phony. It's false. Even sometimes they'll say, \"Sources say.\" There is no source, in many cases -- in cases there is. But --\nNo, no, no. It's not --\nNinety-four percent negative.\nYes.\nHillary Clinton fan.\nExcuse me, Hillary Clinton fan.\nWould it have been nicer if we got Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn't it been nice? Living -- think of this, living in Pakistan, beautifully in Pakistan and what I guess in what they considered a nice mansion, I don't know, I've seen nicer.\nBut living in Pakistan right next to the military academy, everybody in Pakistan knew he was there. And we give Pakistan $1.3 billion and year and they don't tell him, they don't tell him --\nThey took him down but look, look, there's news right there, he lived in Pakistan, we're supporting Pakistan, we're giving them $1.3 billion a year, which we don't give them any more by the way, I ended it, because they don't do anything for us, they don't do a damn thing for us.\nI'm totally in favor of the media, I'm totally in favor of free press, got to be fair press. When it's fake --\nI can tell what's fair and what's not and so can my people and so can a lot of other people.\nWell, no, he didn't talk about the news, he didn't talk about anything. I'm only saying it very differently than anyone's ever said it before, I'm saying fake news, false reporting, dishonest reporting of which there is a lot, and I know it. See, I know it because I'm a subject of it, a lot of people don't know but when I explain it to them, they understand it.\nAnd, Chris, you know that better, you don't have to sit here and act like a perfect little, wonderful, innocent angel. I know you too well, I knew your father too well, that's not your gene. But let me tell you --\nMost of it is biased, most of it.\nI'm not calling you that.\nI'm not calling you - you don't understand it.\nI am calling fake news, fake reporting is what's tearing this country apart because people know, people like things that are happening and they're not hearing about it.\nI think I'm doing a great job. We have the best economy we've ever had.\nWe're doing really well -- we would have been at war with North Korea if let's say that administration would have continued forward.\nI would give myself, I would -- look, I hate to do it, but I will do it. I would give myself an A plus, is that enough? Can I go higher than that?\nNo, no.\nJust won't happen, it's not - I think the eight-year limit is a good thing, not a bad thing.\nExcuse me. Not security concern, they wouldn't allow me to go. They said, sir - Secret Service said, sir, you cannot go we are not prepared, you cannot go. Because it was supposed to be helicopter but the helicopter couldn't fly because of zero visibility.\nThey said, sir, you can not go.\nI should have done that, I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling as you know.\nBut I would have -- I would have done it.\nWell, I think you will see that happen. There are things that are being planned. We don't want to talk about it because of -- obviously because of security reasons and everything else.\nBut there are things that are planned. As you know, I was very much opposed to the war in Iraq. I think it was a tremendous mistake, should have never happened.\nYou're right.\nI don't think anybody's been more with the military than I have, as a president. In terms of funding, in terms of all of the things I've been able to get them, including the vets. I don't think anybody's done more than me.\nI've had an unbelievable busy schedule and I will be doing it. On top of which you have these phony witch hunts. On top of which -- I mean, we've just been very busy. But I will be doing that.\nMia Love gave me no love and she lost. Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.\nThe same thing with April Ryan. I watch her get up. I mean, you talk about somebody that's a loser. She doesn't know what the hell she's doing.\nABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Do you want him to reign in Robert Mueller?\nWhat a stupid question that is. What a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.\nI think that if I was very different, I wouldn't have gotten what we had to get. We got the biggest tax cuts in history, we got ANWR approved, we have -- we got rid of the individual mandate, which was the most unpopular thing you can imagine, health care -- I got rid of it. Everybody said it would be impossible to get rid of it. And many, many -- you know, the regulations.\nI think if I was a, you know, more modified, more moderate in that sense, I don't think I would have done half of the things that I was able to get completed. With that being said, other than you have to have a certain ability to fight back and, as you know, people have -- you know, they take strong stance on me both ways, you know love and hate. I'd like to see it a little bit, maybe, more right down the middle. But tone is something that is important to me. But a lot of times you can't practice tone because you have people coming at you so hard that if you don't fight back in a somewhat vigorous way, you're not going to win. And we have to win. This country has to win.\nWe have a lot of victories coming and I think if I -- if I go too low-key, we're not going to have those victories.\nThank you. Thank you very much, Chris.\nAppreciate it. Thank you.\nYes.\nRight.\nThat's right.\nHere we are. You know I've had people come into this - the biggest people in the world, presidents, prime ministers, the heads of the biggest companies in the world and they always stop and they say, this is the Oval Office. WALLACE: Yes. TRUMP: This is the Oval Office.\nThere's nothing like it in the world. This is the Resolute Desk. Very famous. This is where John John, at the time, right? WALLACE: Right.\nJohn Kennedy was right here. That's a little door that opens up.\nAnd that was the famous picture. I could show you that picture. In fact, I'll give it to you.\nBut this is a very important desk. FDR, John Kennedy, you know we have seven desks and, as president, you can choose any one of the desks. This is, to me, I think the most beautiful in terms of its carving. I also think in many respects it's, you know, just some people that I respect, used this desk. WALLACE: How -- when you're sitting at the desk, how do you make decisions? I mean do you agonize over them? Do you second guess yourself? How does --\nI don't think about it. I don't think about, you know, how I make them. I -- I make what I consider the right decision. I have great people working at the White House. They don't get enough credit. I have some tremendously talented people. And I will talk to them. And sometimes I'll have them go at each other. I do like that. You know, let them go at each other. And they do. They've very competitive people. And at the end I make a decision. And it's certainly -- on the economy, a lot of things, we've been - we've made a lot of good decisions and I want to keep it that way. WALLACE: Do -- do you ever second guess yourself? Do you ever --\nYes, all the time.\nI've -- I've done things where I wished I went a different route but then what you do is you change course and you -- you bring it back. You stabilize it out. But --\nWell, I think North Korea's been very tough because, you know, we were very close. When I took that over, President Obama, right in those two chairs, we sat and talked and he said that's by far the biggest problem that this country has. And I think we had real decision as to which way to go on North Korea. And certainly at least so far I'm very happy with the way we went. I have a very good relationship with Kim.\nYes. Maybe they are. Maybe they're not. I don't believe that. I don't. And, you know, could. And which is - if it -- if that's the way it goes, that's the way it goes. You know, I go with the way we have to go.\nBut so far it's been good. We have a very good relationship. We made, I think, some great decisions for the -- for the people of this country. And I do, you know, I put America first and other countries should put themselves first. It's not like we're -- we should put- and everybody else should be second to us. No, other countries are proud of their countries and their leaders should put their countries first.\nBut we were putting out country in many cases last. We were more worried about the world than we were worried about the United States. That's not going to happen with me.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-chris-wallace-fox-news-1"}
{"Title": "Interview with Philip Rucker and Josh Dawsey of The Washington Post", "Date": "2018-11-27", "Text": "We're there because virtually every expert that I have and speak to say if we don't go there, they're going to be fighting over here. And I've heard it over and over again. We're in the process of doing some — you know, as you know, we are talking about peace over there with the Taliban, with the group of people that have a lot to do with it. They would like to see it after all these years, and we'll see what happens. A little bit too early to say what's going to happen. But we are talking about things. But it's a very sad situation when I look — we have incredible people, incredible fighters. But we're going to see what happens. We're going to see what happens. But it's very sad. I just heard about the three people this morning. Terrible.\nAt the right time I will.\nI'd rather not. At some point, I'll talk on the record about it. But I'd rather not.\n[Trump speaks off the record.]\nI think that's been shown better than ever in the last short period of two weeks — that we need a wall. I see the Democrats are going to want to do something, because they understand too. Those pictures are very bad for the Democrats. We're not having a wall because of the Democrats. We need Democrat votes to have a wall. Now, if we don't get it, will I get it done another way? I might get it done another way. There are other potential ways that I can do it. You saw what we did with the military, just coming in with the barbed wire and the fencing, and various other things.\nNo, it's the Democrats' fault that we don't have a wall, because they never gave us the vote. They just wouldn't give us the vote.\nWe almost had a deal, except when — I mean, actually, it wasn't their fault, wasn't our fault, it was on DACA. We almost had a deal, and then the judge ruled shockingly in favor of Obama's signature, when even Obama said what he's doing is not legal. Essentially, he said, it's not going to hold up. But when the judge ruled, all of a sudden it was like, that's the end of that deal. But we were very close to having a deal — $25 billion for a wall and various other things on the border. And DACA. And when the judge shockingly — you know, the Democrats never thought they were going to win that, and then you had another couple of judges rule, and then you had judges rule the other way. It's going to be settled, I assume, in the Supreme Court. But we were close to having a deal on DACA until that ruling.\nIt's not a question of take from McConnell. McConnell is a friend of mine. We get along great. We've had a fantastic relationship. We've had a big success. We've had a lot of success. Hopefully today we'll have another success [in Mississippi]; we'll see what happens.\nI did 4 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and one in the middle. Based on the enthusiasm we saw there, I think we're going to do very well, but we'll see. I know one thing: If she loses, I'll be blamed, and if she wins, I'll be given no credit. That's the only thing I know.\nBut anyway, do you guys want something to drink?\nGo ahead.\nOne of the problems that a lot of people like myself — we have very high levels of intelligence, but we're not necessarily such believers. You look at our air and our water, and it's right now at a record clean. But when you look at China and you look at parts of Asia and when you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including — just many other places — the air is incredibly dirty. And when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small. And it blows over and it sails over. I mean, we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific, it flows, and we say where does this come from. And it takes many people to start off with.\nNumber two, if you go back and if you look at articles, they talked about global freezing, they talked about at some point the planets could have freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion. There is movement in the atmosphere. There's no question. As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it — not nearly like it is. Do we want clean water? Absolutely. Do we want clean air to breathe? Absolutely. The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire, they have trees that were fallen, they did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can light — you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months. And it's a massive problem in California.\nJosh, you go to other places where they have denser trees — it's more dense, where the trees are more flammable — they don't have forest fires like this, because they maintain. And it was very interesting, I was watching the firemen, and they're raking brush — you know the tumbleweed and brush, and all this stuff that's growing underneath. It's on fire, and they're raking it, working so hard, and they're raking all this stuff. If that was raked in the beginning, there'd be nothing to catch on fire. It's very interesting to see. A lot of the trees, they took tremendous burn at the bottom, but they didn't catch on fire. The bottom is all burned but they didn't catch on fire because they sucked the water, they're wet. You need forest management, and they don't have it.\nYes, we've got a lot of news there.\nNo, no, but we have plants moving in, too. We do.\nNo, I'm not because what I'm doing is I'm doing trade deals. The trade deals take a little time. The fact is, I think — I disagree with the Fed. I've been open about that. I think the Fed is a much bigger problem than China. I think that China wants to make a deal very badly. I think we'll either make a deal or we'll be taking in billions and billions of dollars a month in tariffs, and I'm okay with either one of those two situations. But I can tell you that China wants to make a deal. I can tell you that other countries want to make deals because they know that I'm not playing around. The USMCA was a very well-received deal. That got done, and a lot of people said it wouldn't get done. We're making great trade deals. We lose $800 billion a year with trade.\nOh, I'm not blaming anybody.\nI'm not blaming — look, I took recommendations. I'm not blaming anybody. But I will tell you, at this moment in time I am not at all happy with the Fed. I am not at all happy with my choice. I think we have to let it go. You know, if you look at — China is being accommodative. The euro and Europe is being accommodative. We're not getting any accommodation, and we're also paying $50 billion, we're paying down our liquidity, is — you can make the case it's a positive thing in one way, but another thing, it snaps your liquidity. So I'm doing deals, and I'm not being accommodated by the Fed. I'm not happy with the Fed. They're making a mistake because I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.\nI'm not blaming anybody.\nI'm just saying, I'm not happy with the Fed. So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay [Powell for Federal Reserve Board chair]. Not even a little bit.\nAnd I'm not blaming anybody, but I'm just telling you I think that the Fed is way off base with what they're doing, number one. Number two, a positive note, we're doing very well on trade, we're doing very well — our companies are very strong. Don't forget, we're still up from when I came in, 38 percent or something. You know, it's a tremendous — it's not like we're up — and we're much stronger. And we're much more liquid. And the banks are now much more liquid during my tenure. And I'm not doing — I'm not playing by the same rules as Obama. Obama had zero interest to worry about; we're paying interest, a lot of interest. He wasn't paying down — we're talking about $50 billion lots of different times, paying down and knocking out liquidity. Well, Obama didn't do that. And just so you understand, I'm playing a normalization economy, whereas he's playing a free economy. It's easy to make money when you're paying no interest. It's easy to make money when you're not doing any pay-downs, so you can't — and despite that, the numbers we have are phenomenal numbers.\nI'm going to listen to what they say. They're all friends of mine, and I get along with them great. I'm going to certainly listen to what they have to say, Josh. In the end, though, they're spending massive amounts of billions of dollars. If you look at Iran and what they do, and you look at many other countries — I don't have to embarrass other countries by saying it — if you look at what they do, it's a rough part of the world. It's a dangerous, rough part of the world. But they've been a great ally. Without them, Israel would be in a lot more trouble. We need to have a counterbalance to Iran. I know him. I know him well, the crown prince. And, by the way, never did business with them, never intend to do business with them. I couldn't care less. This is a very important job that I'm doing right now. The last thing I care about is doing business with people. I only do business for us. Somebody said, well, maybe they're an investor in one of his jobs. The answer is no. But I just feel that it's very, very important to maintain that relationship. It's very important to have Saudi Arabia as an ally, if we're going to stay in that part of the world. Now, are we going to stay in that part of the world? One reason to is Israel. Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we're producing more oil now than we've ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don't have to stay there.\nWell, it's not scheduled, but I certainly would. But it is not scheduled.\nI haven't taken anything.\nPhil, I haven't done that. If you look at my statement, it's maybe he did and maybe he didn't. But he denies it. And people around him deny it. And the CIA did not say affirmatively he did it, either, by the way. I'm not saying that they're saying he didn't do it, but they didn't say it affirmatively. I'm saying this: We have $52-a-barrel oil right now and I called them about three months ago, before this whole thing happened with Khashoggi, and I let him have it about oil. We were up to $82 — probably two and a half months ago — we were up to $82 a barrel, and it was going up to $100, and that would've been like a massive tax increase, and I didn't want that. And I called them and they let the oil start flowing, and we're at $52. In fact, now I'm being blamed for traffic jams. This was the greatest. Actually in the Palm Beach Post, they had a thing that I'm causing traffic jams because they have the —\nIt's the Palm Beach Post.\nPhil, I'm getting advice. I'm the president of this country. I have to do what's the best for our country. We have a very important ally in Saudi Arabia. We have an ally that has tremendous oil reserves, which are — frankly, they can make prices go up and down, and I want to keep them down. We have an ally that's investing billions and billions of dollars in our country. They could very easily invest $110 billion, $450 billion overall over a period of time, fairly short period of time. $110 billion in military. Russia and China would love to have those orders, and they'll get them if we don't. They'll have no choice, but they'll get them if we don't. So I take everything into consideration, and again, he totally denies it, and he denied it to me on three different occasions, on three different calls, and a lot of other people deny it, too. Did he do it? As I said, maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but in the meantime Saudi Arabia's spending billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and I want them to spend it here. I don't want them to spend it in China and Russia.\nI am getting a report on that tonight, and that will determine what happens at the meeting. I'm getting a full report on that tonight. That will be very determinative. Maybe I won't have the meeting. Maybe I won't even have the meeting. We're going to see. But depending on what comes out tonight, we should have a pretty good indication on exactly what happened tonight at about 6 o'clock.\nI don't like that aggression. I don't like that aggression at all. Absolutely. And by the way, Europe shouldn't like that aggression. And Germany shouldn't like that aggression. You know they're paying 1 percent, and they're supposed to be paying much more than 1 percent.\nThey're absolutely not doing enough. Germany? Absolutely not. Many of those countries are not doing enough toward NATO. They should be spending much more money.\nHe's a fine person.\nThat I don't know.\nI can tell you that Matt Whitaker is a respected man. He's doing an excellent job. We're looking at possible attorney generals right now. And within — I will tell you, within the Justice Department he is a highly respected person, and he's doing a very good job. I also think he's a very good person. I think he's a very good person. And he had a reputation for being — I think he was six years in Iowa as the U.S. attorney. He had a reputation for being very strong, very smart, very good.\nWe don't talk very much. I mean, I haven't spoken to Matt very much. I put him there. But we speak really very little. The Mueller investigation is what it is. It just goes on and on and on.\n— almost two years. And in the meantime, he's still there. He wouldn't have to be, but he's still there, so I have no intention of doing anything.\nOkay? Thank you, fellas.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-philip-rucker-and-josh-dawsey-the-washington-post"}
{"Title": "Interview with Saagar Enjeti and Vince Coglianese of The Daily Caller", "Date": "2019-01-31", "Text": "It was a horrible event. He was a very, very sick person, obviously. It was very unusual in that there didn't seem to be your standard set of reasons as to why this would happen. I'm a little surprised that the report wasn't much longer but at the same time I can understand it. It was just a — just a terrible thing. They were unable to find a real reason other than, obviously, he was sick and they didn't know it.\nSo, I was a little surprised and a lot disappointed that they weren't able to find the reason. Because you'd like to find a reason for that.\nI was watching it like everybody else. I thought it was horrible. I went to the hospital, I saw many of the victims and right after the event it was horrible. It was inconceivable. But he was a very sick person and nobody would've known it. Nobody had any idea. He had money — or at least they think he had money. He was a gambler, you know, you don't see too many gamblers that have money.\nI think they worked very hard. I will tell you they worked very hard on that case. They just were unable to find anything from all of the facts. Because I've looked at some of the things also and it was a very unusual case of a very sick person who just, people never saw that coming.\nI thought it was very unusual. You know, I've stayed out of that whole situation so that — because there was no collusion whatsoever. There was no nothing done wrong and frankly, I could have waded in very early, I could have ended it very easily if I wanted to but just let it run its course. But I will say, like, I'm speaking for a lot of people that were very disappointed to see that go down that way, to see it happen where it was on camera, on top of it.\n— You have 29 people and you have armored vehicles and you had all of the other and, you know, many people know Roger, and Roger is not a person that they would have to worry about from that standpoint. I thought it was sad to see it.\nI think it's a good question for you to ask, and it's something I'll think about.\nIncluding me.\nWhat a great question that is. It's one of the better questions. I hope you're going to play your question because that is a very, very interesting — you're talking about, I guess they're well over 30 million dollars now on this Russian collusion hoax, and everybody knows it's a hoax. They've spent all this money. Nothing. No phone calls, no meetings, no nothing. You look at it, and you say, isn't that sad to have devoted this time, this energy over a — you know, look, there's been numerous books written right now, including number one best sellers, calling it a \"hoax.\" And it is very sad. That is very sad. By the way, to me, both very sad events.\nBut that is very interesting to ask, where you've had so many people killed, and so badly wounded, because I went to the hospital. You had people so badly wounded. People never talk about the wounded. The level of hurt and devastation for a whole lifetime. You know, many people just devastated for a lifetime. They'll never be the same. And you look at that by comparison to the Russian hoax, it's a shame. The Russian witch hunt, it's a shame.\nNo. No, I haven't spoken to him about that. I would say that I think after almost two years it certainly should be. Process crimes or process, you know, questions, the answer is different than what you thought it might be and some people say they lost their memory or a lack of memory, which a lot of people can understand that too.\nNo, I never spoke to him about that.\nThey'll have to make their decision within the Justice Department. They will make the decision as to what they do. I could've taken a much different stance, I could've gotten involved in this, I could've terminated everything. I could've ended everything. I've chosen to stay out of it. But I had the right to, as you know, I had the right if I wanted to to end everything. I could've just said, 'that's enough.' Many people thought that's what I should do.\nWell, I never had anything to do with the Russians having to do with this. I ran a great campaign. I ran a campaign that now they say was better than that gentleman's [Andrew Jackson's] campaign in the 1800s and we did a great job.\nAnd we got 306 to 223 and that's that. Won states that nobody thought were possible to win. Remember the expression, 'he cannot get to 270.' And we got way beyond 270.\nAnd I don't even say she ran a bad campaign. I think I ran a very good campaign.\nWell, I was going to veto the omnibus bill and Paul told me in the strongest of language, 'Please don't do that, we'll get you the wall.' And I said, 'I hope you mean that because I don't like this bill,' although I love the bill for what it did for the military. And therefore, if it weren't for the military I would have vetoed it.\nJust so you understand, our military needed funding desperately. Totally depleted. And this bill was great for the military. Had I vetoed it, you would never have gotten the numbers back that I got: $700 and $716 billion over the last two years. Which is substantially more — much more than President Obama was able to get for the military.\nSo that was a negative but a big factor as to why that was the reason I signed it. But another very big factor was the fact that Paul told me in the strongest of terms that, 'please sign this and if you sign this we will get you that wall.' Which is desperately needed by our country. Humanitarian crisis, trafficking, drugs, you know, everything — people, criminals, gangs, so we need the wall.\nAnd then he went lame duck. And once he went lame duck it was just really an exercise in waving to people and the power was gone, so I was very disappointed. I was very disappointed in Paul because the wall was so desperately needed. And it is. And I'll get the wall.\nI don't want to say he lied. I think he probably meant it at the time, I guess. I hope. So I don't call that lying. But when he went lame duck, meaning, he said he's not running again — and it was very unusual because usually they'll do that sometime after an election and he didn't want to do that because it's somewhat misrepresenting and I understand that too. But maybe you don't run, okay? Maybe you just don't run. And he had an excellent person taking his place in Congress, he ran a great campaign, did a really good job.\nSo Paul said, 'please sign the omnibus bill.' Now, in all fairness to Paul, I may have signed it anyway because it was so much more money than anyone ever thought possible for the military, and equal to the wall and maybe even greater than the wall was my promise to refurbish the military.\nYou know, I made many statements, many promises. In fact, here are some of them, folks. But those are some of the things we've accomplished. VA choice, VA accountability — you know, these are things that for decades and decades and I got a lot of these things. Tax cuts, regulation cuts by far the most that anybody's ever got, biggest tax cuts. And that's why you look at the market — we just hit over 25,000. We're back where we were, right?\nSo anyway, that's the story.\nFirst of all, it's not mine to give up right now because DACA is going to the Supreme Court, hopefully. But miraculously, and horribly, they lost DACA. This was a case that President Obama said, essentially, he doesn't have the right to sign. But they went, as usual, to the Ninth Circuit and they won a case, they won an appeal, and now it's hopefully going to the Supreme Court soon because this is a very important case.\nWe should win that case easily, you know, it should be won.\nNow, if it is won, then we'll talk about DACA but right now — when that case was lost we were very close to making a deal. And then a judge in the Ninth Circuit agreed that President Obama, although President Obama didn't think he had a right to do it, he said that — as soon as that was done, I said, 'that's the end of that deal.'\nWe had a deal for some DACA — for a lot of things. But we had a deal done and I said to people when that case was lost — well, it wasn't lost permanently, I think we're going to ultimately win — that's the time I want to talk about it.\nWell I said to people, I saw yesterday, 'well, what about DACA,' I said, 'it's highly unlikely.' I was tougher than anybody else on that. I could see doing something for DACA but I want to find out what the Supreme Court's gonna do first.\nI don't blame him.\nBecause he doesn't want me to make the deal. He doesn't want to make me — because my idea of a deal is different than other people's. Without our involvement a deal's not going to get done and I think we're going to — look, that deal. Look, there are numerous things we could do, including declaring a national emergency where we have very good law on our side, including the fact that I'm already building a tremendous amount of wall. People don't realize that.\nI'm going to be announcing the exact numbers but I'll have over a hundred miles of wall either built or under construction between new and renovated. Over a hundred miles. We have a tremendous amount of money right now to build a wall. We're building the wall. I'll be announcing some numbers on — but in addition to that we declare a national emergency if this doesn't work out.\nWe have, I believe, that area — yes. We have a tremendous problem in that area.\nIt's very interesting, California, you know, they always say, 'don't build a wall,' well, they were begging me to build a wall over in San Diego. The day I finished they said, 'don't build a wall.' But they were begging me to build the wall because people were pouring in through that border, through that area.\nWe built a brand new wall. That's not a renovated wall, that's a brand new wall. We took down the old wall, we built a brand new wall. It's fantastic, looks great, they did a great job, totally stopped everybody from coming in. The day we completed it California started saying, 'don't build a wall, we don't want a wall.' They want drones, right? Flying up around.\nWell, look, I hope that she's healthy, I hope she's happy, and I hope she lives for a long time.\nWell I've been very religious. I've very much confined myself to that list, as you know. And that list has great people on it and I would say it's highly likely I would stay. I think one of the things —\nNo, she would certainly be a choice. I think anybody on that list would be a choice. They're great people. I've been told, and I don't know that that's true, I would be surprised if it's true, but a lot of people said that list was one of the reasons I won.\nBecause, being a non-politician, where you don't have a record of choosing people, people just didn't know who I would choose. And Supreme Court, especially for the Republican Party, it seems, was very, very important and I came up with the idea of a list of 20 and then I increased it to 25, 25 people and they're very outstanding people. I felt so badly that Justice Kavanaugh had to go through what he had to go through but now he's a Supreme Court justice and he's going to be a great one.\nJustice Gorsuch went through much easier and he's going to be a great one.\nWell, I know nothing about it. That I can tell you. I would not do it. I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do that.\nIn fact, you can tell them for the first time, I will not do that. It's a false report.\nI've had many false reports from the Wall Street editorial board. Like, as an example, right now we're negotiating with China. We're doing very well. Wall Street — they don't like tariffs. If we didn't have tariffs they wouldn't even be talking to us. They would not even be talking to us. You understand that?\nWell, what happens is that right now China's paying 25 percent on $50 billion worth of goods. Mostly high technology. And I was going to charge them 25 percent on $200 billion worth of goods and then I'd have $267 billion leftover where I'm not charging them anything. At their request, and subject to this deal until March 1st, I'm charging them 10 percent on 200 billion. You've got the 50 and the 25, then you've got 200 and I'm charging them 10 percent until March 1st. After March 1st it will go up to 25 percent.\nSo yeah, that's very important to me.\nYou know, billions of dollars are being poured into our treasury. Billions. We never had five cents come into our treasury. Now we have billions of dollars and in addition, and very importantly…\nThe president returns to the issue of the Ninth Circuit court.\nThe Ninth Circuit is so much in one direction that you couldn't make that deal. Look, I've lost … the United States has lost so many cases in the Ninth Circuit and, you know, I had an argument — a slight argument, which, I think was not too much of an argument — with Justice Roberts about the Ninth Circuit. If I did that, what are we doing? We have to catch up because we are so far behind on the Ninth Circuit. So I would never make that deal. And I can tell you, if it is made I would end it, but it wasn't, you know, not that I know of.\nNo, the answer is: I would not do that. You don't catch up by making those deals.\nTerrible.\n'So help me God.' Took the phrase off of a document. And I said, 'Where are we going?'\nI think it's a terrible thing for our country and I think it's certainly a terrible thing for the Democrats because I don't think they're going to be able to get away with it.\nI watched that this morning. I watched the person testifying and I felt it was terrible.\nYes. Do you remember during the debate I said Hillary Clinton was willing to rip the baby out of the womb just prior to birth? And I used the term 'rip'? That's what it is. That's what they're doing, it's terrible.\nI think this is going to lift up the whole pro-life movement like maybe it's never been lifted before. And the pro-life movement is very much a 50-50, it's a very 50-50 issue. Actually it's gained a point or two over the years, but it's been very much 49-51 and vice-versa. I think this really will lift up the issue because people have never thought of it in those terms. Cause she actually said, you know, the day of, virtually the day of birth.\nOh did he? So he confirmed that?\nI'm surprised that he did that. I've met him a number of times. I'm surprised that he said that. I saw the woman do it — who ever that was, was that the attorney general?\nSo I was very, very surprised that they would say that and allow that.\nWell, in fact, we're making up a list very shortly.\nBut I will say that some of them will be border-related, some of them will be people who have suffered very badly because we didn't do what we should've done in a very dangerous part of our country, and so that's going to be a part of it, absolutely.\nAt the same time, the world is not doing well and we're going great. You look at the numbers, we're hitting highs. I get no credit for it. It's like, when do you ever hear them talking about — we just hit 25,000 and you won't even hear a thing about it. If President Obama were there — and don't forget, he was paying no interest. We're actually paying interest. You know, he was paying no interest. He didn't have liquidity being drained out of the market in order to pay it down, which we have. How about 50 billion dollars a month? $50 billion a month.\nIf I had a no interest, no liquidity situation with respect to the market, I mean, forget it. It would actually be incredible, the numbers. Big difference. Tremendous difference.\nSo, it's talent, it's chemistry — they have a great chemistry with each other — I mean, I like all three of them, as you know, I'm very good friends with them. Coach Belichick endorsed me, you remember that?\nBelichick is so tough and Kraft is a great guy. The three of them they just have — how good was Brady, I mean, the last game? Not the last game, the last two games. Brady plays better under pressure than he does in a regular game. I mean, that last two minutes the way he was throwing the ball down the field — they were bullets.\nAnd I've seen how hard that ball comes at you, those guys were doing a great job. They were catching that, you know? That ball is whipped.\nNo, I don't want to take credit for that. You know I get along very well with the NFL. I helped them in Canada, you know that story where they were having a dispute for many years with Canada. And as part of NAFTA, you know, the termination of NAFTA and the new — but as part of NAFTA, which is now the USMCA, I was able to get their dispute settled because they're a great American company and I don't want great American companies to have problems.\nIn fact, Commissioner [Roger] Goodell called me and he thanked me, you know, they were working on that thing for years. It was having to do with the advertisements for the Super Bowl, it was a long-term problem and I got it solved.\nI think it's great what they did, it looks like it's straightened out. I think that may be famous last words, let's see what happens, but I think in the end it really worked out great. And, you know what, their ratings went up along with — as that problem went down, their ratings went up.\nNo, I think — look, I think that worked out very well. I was very pleased that he called me to thank me for helping him with Canada and yeah, it looks good. And their games have really been good other than one call. It was a little bit — I feel badly, it was a great state that voted for me, Louisiana. I feel very badly for Louisiana because that was maybe the worst call I've ever seen but I guess there's nothing they can do about that. And you might say it, I feel badly for Louisiana.\nWell so far a lot of them. I don't mind. I think that there's a lot of talk about — it looks like Elizabeth Warren has not caught on like they thought she would. She fell into a trap. It's called the Pocahontas trap.\nThere's so many of them. The truth is there are some I'd love to run against.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-saagar-enjeti-and-vince-coglianese-the-daily-caller"}
{"Title": "Interview with Peter Baker of The New York Times", "Date": "2019-02-01", "Text": "How you guys doing? You're O.K.?\nVery good. We had a busy day.\nSo, we just had, this is from, they just delivered that to me from President Xi. You'll get a transcript of the meeting. The press was here. A lot of the press was here. A nice letter. They have a nice way of giving letters.\nBut we're doing very successfully.\nYeah.\nWell, we're getting closer. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. And we're going comprehensive. We're not just — He announced that he was buying — today — a tremendous amount of soybeans and various farm products. And I think you'll be given that information in a little while, too. But he announced. What he did was the vice premier came in. He was here for two days having meetings. He's leaving tomorrow. They're meeting again now. And negotiations are going very well.\nThat doesn't mean there are any guarantees. But I will say there's a very good feeling. There's a very good relationship. This is the letter. You can actually read it. This is the translated version. So you can get a print out of that. But that was given out, and it was also, I guess it was read. They had the interpreter read it.\nIt's possible. It's a very short period of time for a deal this big. But it's very possible. But many of the points were agreed to. And some haven't been. I believe that a lot of the biggest points are going to be agreed to by me and him. In other words, they're just not going to be authorized to agree to certain things that you folks write about and read about — intellectual property and lots of other things. And I think that will be agreed to by me and him at the right time. Like when you make a big deal, or a big scoop, you have to approve that little thing. And I think they're probably waiting, they're waiting for me and him to sit down and agree on five points at the end, or 10 points at the end.\nWell, I think control is very important. I think the checking to make sure that — we're putting in a very strong system of checks and balances so that when we make a deal we know that it's happening. In other words, that it's being followed. And we've asked for the most stringent controls on that, because there's been difficulty over the years with certain places. And that's a very important element that's been agreed to. But you have to get it down in writing.\nYou're going to have intellectual property. You're going to have theft, because so many things have been, in theory, done a little bit differently. And I think that in the end we're going to have something that's going to be very special, if it happens.\nI could have had a deal done, if I wanted to make — you know, most people thought it was going to be a deal where they buy a tremendous amount of corn and soybeans and that'll be it and everybody's happy and the farmers are happy. But he actually announced today — I wish you were here, because it was sort of a great thing to watch. The press was packed. A lot of Chinese press, too. And he announced that he's buying a massive amount of soybeans and various other farm products today. Starting immediately. And that's going to make a lot of farmers very happy. So you know, that was very nice.\nYes.\nPeter, without the tariffs, we wouldn't be talking. And I make this point clear to them. We've never had a deal with China. We've never had a trade deal with China. You have the World Trade Organization, which is a disaster for the United States. The World Trade Organization is probably the worst trade deal ever made with Nafta being second. The World Trade Organization helped create China. If you look at China, it's flatlined. And from the day the World Trade Organization came into existence, it's a rocket ship. But just the opposite for the United States. That was a terrible deal for the United States and it was an unbelievably good deal for China.\nYeah, sure. We have 25 percent now on $50 billion. And by the way, Peter, that's a lot of money pouring into our Treasury, you know. We never made 5 cents with China. We're getting right now 25 percent on $50 billion. And then I was putting 25 percent at a later date, which date came and went — 25 percent or $200 billion.\nHABERMAN, White House correspondent: You've talked about the sacrifice that this has presented for yourself, for your family, being president. For your business. Could you ever see a point in the next year where you say, \"You know what, I don't need to do this again, I don't need to run for re-election\"?\nI don't see it, because — so I just gave you a list of a lot of the things we've done. And this list isn't even complete. I don't even know if you have it.\nJust grab it. Reading material for the night. I've actually had, because they've done things that are artificial. So there's been more of a burden on me than other presidents.\nPast presidents, yeah. I think for the most part, yeah, past presidents. I really believe, when I say that we've accomplished — when you look at that list, whether it's the biggest regulation cuts in history, that's one of the reasons the economy is doing well. Before the taxes, actually. But the tax cuts, but so many other things when you look at that and you go down the list: Veterans Choice, V.A. Choice. They've been trying — as long as you've been writing they've been trying to get V.A. Choice. And now I'm going to do Phase 2 on V.A. Choice, which is, you know, the next step. But the first step was just a massive step. Nobody thought it could be done.\nI think what we'll be focusing on will be national security, very much. So we've very largely — we're in the process of rebuilding the military. Which was truly depleted.\nNo, because it's a very big job and there is a lot to do. And I would say that I would really start focusing — you know, we've done a lot on health care, and people haven't given us too much credit. We have a lot of the different plans, the cooperative plans and other plans. Health care was terminated, and if the Obamacare were repealed and replaced — except for John McCain, it would have been, you know, he campaigned against it for six years, and then when he had the chance, he went thumbs down at 2:00 in the morning.\nUm, but, I believe it's going to be terminated, whether it be through the Texas case, which is going through the court system as a victory right now, because of, you know, the various elements of that case, you would think it would have to be terminated. But a deal will be made for good health care in this country. That's one of the things I'll be doing.\nNational security is very important and we're fighting over — a very important element is the southern border. When we talk about drugs coming from China, the fentanyl — you look at the heroin and a lot of the other drugs, they come from — 90 percent, more than 90 percent — from right across the southern border. And unlike what the Democrats say, they don't, you don't bring trucks of drugs through the checkpoints. You bring trucks of drugs by making a right 20 miles, and a left into the country. They're not bringing, you know, they bring massive amounts of drugs, and they do it because there's no barrier, there's no hardened wall that you can't knock down with your breath.\nSo, Maggie, here's the bottom line: I love doing it. I don't know if i should love doing it, but I love doing it.\nWe just had a deal —and I was so looking forward to introducing you because it was very impressive. You know the whole — this room was totally, it was a sea of seats, we had the entire cabinet. They are very impressive people, and I had it all teed up and I said, \"Where are they?\" Right? I said, \"Where the hell are they?\"\nAnyway.\nWhat I'm saying, there's a lot, there's always a lot to do, no matter how much you do. I've done a lot, and there's a lot to do.\nI don't see it. You know, we've had polls as high as 93 percent. Which is the highest there is. Reagan was 86.\nDuring, during a tiny little period, during the World Trade Center. That ended quickly.\nNo. No. I have great support in the party. We have great support. I guess anything is possible. But look, we have among the highest polls — and actually the highest polls — but among the highest polls ever in the history of the Republican party.\nDemocrats, I mean the Democrats, I'm watching what's going on. They've really drifted far left. They may even be too left for you folks, you know. I'm not even sure. But they've gone pretty far out there. And, uh —\nSo, you never know that answer. You — somebody that you think would be the least tough is the toughest. I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala [pronouncing as Kameela] Harris. I would say, in terms of the opening act, I would say, would be her. I think she probably —\nI just think she seemed to have a little better opening act than others. I think.\nA better crowd — better crowd, better enthusiasm. Some of the others were very flat. I do think Elizabeth Warren's been hurt very badly with the Pocahontas trap. I think she's been hurt badly. I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility and now all of a sudden, it's gone. And I may be wrong about that but, you know, I don't see it. Some — you know, a lot of the folks have not decided to run yet. They might not run.\nI don't — you know, I'd like to see him run. I'd like to see him run.\nBecause you pit him, and — you take what happened to Obama. When you look at my numbers, and you look how we've done for the economy, we had a news conference before, where we had a lot of workers behind us, manufacturers and workers from manufacturing plants, and it was really impressive to see what they've done. And they said, \"Two years ago, we were dead,\" and now they're thriving.\nYou know, we've created over 500,000 manufacturing jobs, and the previous administration lost 200,000 over eight years and said that was the magic wand. I believe, I believe, Peter, right? The magic wand to get manufacturing back. I mean, manufacturing jobs are great jobs. Those are high paying, great jobs, and they make things. It's a very important thing.\nSo, I just think, I think when we have the lowest black unemployment ever —lowest Hispanic, you saw the Hispanic numbers. We were at, what, 19 points up? Where we have the lowest Asian [unemployment]. Where the women are the best in 52 years now. Where the unemployment numbers are the best in 51 years. Um, you know. That's a good record.\nYeah.\nNo. I don't think I have the authority to do that. I'm not sure I do.\nBut I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it.\nI was never involved with the security. I know that he — you know, just from reading — I know that there was issues back and forth about security for numerous people, actually. But I don't want to get involved in that stuff.\nI don't know. I just don't — I just, I never thought it was necessary. I also know him. He's a very solid person, and I just can't imagine he would have — I guess even, Ivanka, they, they, I heard that, uh, something with Jared and Ivanka —\nBut, uh, I don't believe I've ever met any of the national security — of the people that would do clearances. Um, and there'd be nothing wrong, I don't think, with me calling them up to the Oval Office and say, \"Hey give these people, you know, clearances\" —\nYeah, yeah, so there, I, I mean, I take back the other — I didn't, I was answering a little bit different question. Uh, I have the right to do it, but I never thought it was necessary, Maggie. I never thought it was necessary.\nNo. And, and frankly, I never thought it was necessary to do so.\nSo I'll tell you a story that just happened. So it just happened. [To an aide] Will you get that thing we just sent out? Will you do that? I had a meeting — and bring the picture in, bring the picture — so I had a meeting with Gina [Haspel] who's very good and [Dan] Coats. And I was shocked and I was surprised because I saw it on television and I said, \"Iran is a bad actor because if you read what they said.\"\nYeah. I said, \"Iran is a bad actor.\" And I could tell you stories of things that we were going to do to them as recently as a week ago. I said, \"Iran is a very bad actor. What's this like Iran is kindergarten stuff?\" They said, \"Sir, we never said it.\" I said, \"What are you talking about?\"\nThen I said, \"And ISIS — we almost have the caliphate 100 percent. What are you talking about?\" Like ISIS has got — and I mean, I'm not, by the way — the defeat is an interesting word. Because you can say you have the caliphate, but you're always going to have people that escape the caliphate and you'll have people around. There's nothing — but that doesn't mean you're going to keep your armies there and everything. Because you're always going to have that. Somebody is going to walk into a store unfortunately.\nBut I said, \"What is that all about? Second of all, third of all, you know how well we're doing with North Korea, what's that?\"\nThey said, \"Sir, our testimony was totally mischaracterized.\" I said, \"What are you talking about?\" And when you read their testimony and you read their statements, it was mischaracterized by the media.\nYou know what I mean. Because when you read their statement, it's not like it was portrayed in the media. Because I came in —\nWhen you see what they said, and they're, they're — let's put it this way. It was really very different when I read it. Because I came in here saying what is this? You mean you're — because one of the things they said very strongly, according to, was that Iran is, essentially, a wonderful place. And I said, \"It's not a wonderful place, it's a bad place, and they're doing bad things.\"\nAnd they said, \"We agree.\" I said, \"What do you mean you agree. You can't agree —\" And they said the testimony was totally mischaracterized.\nI'm happy with Dan Coats. I am. That doesn't mean —\nWell, no, everybody changes. You know, this business, other than me, everybody changes. You know, if you look at my staff.\nSo I wish you could have been here before. Because we had this whole side of the room with secretaries, every one of them. Sonny Perdue. Linda McMahon, big, a big sleeper, she's phenomenal. Somebody said, she's one of our best — you know and you don't ever hear about her or anything. We had Mike Pompeo. We had all of our secretaries, many of our secretaries here, probably half of them.\nAnd then you had the China group over here, the delegation. And I'm looking and I'm saying these are really outstanding people. They're outstanding. Did you notice that today? How outstanding? We have a lot of great people.\nNow I do tell the story about driving down Pennsylvania Avenue, you know. Because I'd been in Washington probably 17 times in my life. And on the 18th time, I was president of the United States. And you know, Washington wasn't really my place. And I didn't know people. I didn't know a lot of people. And I got — I put some people in that I wasn't happy with and I put some people in that I was very happy with.\nBut we've gotten it very — you know, as I've — now I know a lot of people.\nSo I wasn't happy with Mattis. I told Mattis to give me a letter. He didn't just give me that letter. I told him. And you could have seen that on \"60 Minutes.\" I did \"60 Minutes\" and Lesley Stahl asked me a question: \"What do you think of General Mattis?\"\nAnd I said let me be generous. But I just — I didn't like the job he was doing. I wasn't happy with it. I wasn't happy with the — I got him more money than the military has ever seen before. And I wasn't happy with the job that he was doing at all. And I said it's time.\nThat's why in the letter he wrote, \"You have to have your own choice.\" The reason he said that was because I said, \"You're just not my choice.\"\nWell, I have a lot of great people that want it. I also have somebody there who's really been very good. Pat, Pat Shanahan. He's acting. And he's been doing — Maggie, he's been doing a great job. Yeaaaaah?\nO.K., I'll be in in a little while. What's more important than The New York Times? Ok, nothing, nothing.\nSo I'm sure you hear good things about him. He's a very solid guy. You know it's interesting, historically, you just never — you rarely put a military person in, which surprises me. When I first got here, I said what do you mean? That's the natural of all naturals. Actually you need special approvals to put them in, you know, etc., etc. Normally a business person goes in and I mean you have one exception or two exceptions, but historically a business person goes in to the secretary of defense.\nPat — he could stay. Pat Shanahan is doing a terrific job. A tremendous number of people would like that position. One thing — first of all, there's really no chaos in the White House, 'cause the chaos thing — you see it, you're here, you see what's going on.\nBecause that's the way they sell.\nWell, I had this aide. I didn't even know who it was. I said who is Cliff Sims? Who is he? And he would take me to — you know I'd do like a little address — he'd come to — he'd say we're ready for the president. And he'd walk me down to wherever room we're doing a weekly recording or a monthly recording. I hardly knew the guy.\nNow I — once they — I said show me what he looks like. And they showed me a picture. I said, oh, yeah, I know him. He's the video guy. This guy, now he made it sound like he's a top aide. What happens — and I've also had some very good books — but what — and I made a mistake.\nThe mistake I made is on a couple of books, I never spoke to the people. When you don't speak to the people, it's impossible to get—\nWoodward was a mistake. And that was a mistake where they — where I believe he did, he notified a number of people. \"I really want to speak to\" — I would have spoken to him in two seconds. But I didn't speak to him and that was a mistake not speaking to him.\nAnd it was a mistake of my staff. [Turning to the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders] You understand that? It was a mistake of my staff.\nIf I would have spoken to him, even if it was for a fairly short period of time, I think it would have been a little different. The other guy was a huckster, who did the book that did very well.\n\"Fire and Fury.\" It took my name — my name from my Korean situation — \"Fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"\nAnd again, I didn't speak to him. And I would have. I definitely — I never saw him. I did an article with him a couple of years before. And I met him at a house that I have in Beverly Hills. We did an interview. It was a decent story to be honest. It was, you know, a pretty nice story. But I should have seen him too as he was in the White House a lot — that was a [Stephen] Bannon deal. And yet Bannon, now, if you've seen him on an interview over the last six months, I think there's nobody that speaks better. It's a crazy situation.\nI have not. No, I haven't spoken to him in a year and a half.\nHave I what?\nI would say in that territory, yeah. I'm not sure that I spoke to him at all during. You know, maybe a phone call. But not, no, I don't think so.\nSure, now you know Roger didn't work for me in the campaign.\nWell, yeah, but that was before I — you know, that was either early primary or before primary.\nThat was a long time. I will say this, I've always liked — I like Roger, he's a character. But I like Roger. For a team of 29 people with AK27s, or whatever they were using, to charge a house like they did at 6:00 in the morning. I think that was a very sad thing for this country.\nNo.\nNo, I didn't. I never did.\nNever did.\nCan I tell you? I didn't see it. I know what was in the indictment if you read it, there was no collusion with Russia. But that's in a lot of these things. And a lot of them are: They come in, they interview somebody and they get them for lying. I mean, you know.\nI'll give you an example. So I never met Carter Page. I think to this day I never met Carter Page. I never met Carter Page. [George] Papadopoulos, I never met him, other than one time, where he sat at a table along with maybe 10 or 15 other people, because they wanted to set up a national security team. And I guess he has a certain expertise in national security. So he was at a table very briefly. I don't believe I ever spoke to him. You know there were a lot of people. I was there for a very short period of time. Never met him.\nPeople have been treated very, very badly. This is a very bad thing.\nWell, I'd rather save it for later. We'll do something on it at the right time, but I did think this. When Roger Stone, who all of us know, I mean everybody knows Roger.\nHe was not my consultant. But if you read the papers you know it's like — the media, it's like — but I've always liked him. He's a character, and I'll tell you what people respect what he said. Bearing false witness, etc. But yeah, people do respect what he said.\nBear false witness. I will never testify against the president. He actually said at one time — you know he's said it numerous times, but I heard him say it one time he's done a great job, he's a great president, and I will not, you know, lie in order to — people respect that so much. They respect that.\nSo let me tell you about about Trump Tower Moscow. This was a very unimportant deal. This was a very unimportant deal. No. 1. No. 2, this was a deal, the only thing you heard is through Rudy [Giuliani]. Is that what you heard? Through Rudy?\nRudy was incorrect. No. 1, he was incorrect, and we've explained that, he was wrong. Rudy has been wrong. A little bit. But what has happened is this. I didn't care. That deal was not important. It was essentially a letter of intent or an option. I'm not even sure that they had a site. And if you look at where that was sent to, that was a Michael Cohen thing. If you look, I always say, Why don't you bring this up, to Jay Sekulow, good guy. I think it was sent to almost like a public address for Moscow. If you take a look at it. Take a good solid look. The original letter or something was sent. They didn't even have anybody to send it to. But that deal is just like other deals. I was doing other deals. I was running for president, but I was also running a business.\nI would say it was early to middle of the year. Now, I don't know that Cohen didn't go a little bit longer than that. I don't think it would be much longer. But then he could have come back to me and said, \"Listen, I put it together.\" Because that stuff happens. You know, you think a deal — I was running for president, I was doing really well. The last thing I cared about was building a building.\nThat wasn't business. Peter, that wasn't business.\nI had no money invested. It was a letter of intent, or option. It was a free option. It was a nothing. And I wasn't doing anything. I don't consider that even business. And frankly, that wasn't even on my radar. If you take a look at that, take a look at the deal. There was no money put up. There was no transfer. I don't think they had a location. I'm not even sure if they had a location.\nMy point is this — It was a free option to look at a deal, to look at deals. That was not like, \"I'm going to buy a property in Moscow. I'm going to do — or I'm building a building in Moscow.\" Now, I would have had every right to do a deal. That's what I did. That's what I did.\nRudy was wrong in that he went — I think what Rudy was looking at, I think, was that in the statement I made to the Mueller group, we talked about during that period of a year, up until the election, we talked about that. So he may have been referring to that.\nBut the way I view it is early in the year to middle of the year, no interest. I had very little interest in the first place, and again, I viewed it as a free option. It may have been a letter of intent. I don't know exactly what it was called. But it was unimportant. And you know what was very important to me? Running for president. And doing well. But I was running a business. I mean, I would have been allowed to build 20 buildings. I was doing other things. I was doing a lot of other things. I was running a business. Because as you would know, there weren't a lot of people at the time that thought I was going to win. So I don't want to give up a year and a half of my life, not do anything, run for president, then have to go back and say, you know, \"I could have kept running my business.\"\nVery interestingly, you know, George Washington ran his business. You can, I guess, you can go long beyond the election, if you wanted to. You know. But I didn't do that.\nI have nothing. All I did was be a good candidate. Russia didn't help me. Russia did not help me. There was no collusion. There was none of that. I was a good candidate. I did a good job. I won't say whether she was a good candidate or not. I mean, the primary collusion was Hillary Clinton. If you take a look, Peter. I mean, look at that phony dossier. Some of that money, they say, went to Russia. [Tony] Podesta was involved with Russia. You look at the kind of relationships they had. They had real relationships with Russia. I had a potential, a deal that frankly wasn't even a deal. It was literally — I viewed it as an option. But maybe it was called a letter of intent. Something like that.\nNo.\nI don't even talk to him about it.\nI don't talk to him about it. How can you have exposure when you haven't done anything? I had nothing to do with any of this, other than that I was a good candidate that won an election.\nWell he told the attorneys that I'm not a subject, I'm not a target.\nYeah. Oh, yeah.\nAbout which?\nI don't know about that. That I don't know about.\nNo. I don't. We didn't discuss it.\nYeah, that's O.K. Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation.\nHe did. He told me.\nI think the lawyers would speak to him a lot about that. Not a lot. But a number of times. He never said — I never asked him that question.\nThe lawyers ask him. They say, \"He's not a target of the investigation.\"\nWell, that's what I've heard. I've heard his father-in-law was — I'm not saying investigation.\nIt's not witness tampering. It's not witness tampering at all. It's not witness tampering.\nI did have to read what I said. What did I say? I don't know. What did I say?\nWell, I will say this: I think people have the right to speak their mind. You know, speaking your mind. I've heard that for a period of time. But other people have said it, too. I mean, many people have said it.\nBecause of what?\nIt's true.\nWell, I'm not saying I'm doing anything in terms of the military option in Venezuela. But I can say very pointedly we're not taking that off the table.\nWe're involved in wars that are 6,000 miles away. We're involved in wars where it's just absolutely insane what we're doing, and the money we're spending, where in Afghanistan, we're spending $50 billion. That's more than most countries spend for everything.\nWell, I think I'm not closing. I don't close it anywhere. I don't close it. Somebody just asked me, \"Is there a military option?\" I said all options are on the table. I'm not taking anything off the table.\nThere are terrible things happening in Venezuela.\nI have access to things, Peter, that are absolutely terrible, what's going on in Venezuela.\nI'm just saying this: Terrible things are going on. Terrible things are going on in Venezuela. And I look at that, and I see what's happening. Now in Saudi Arabia, a lot of improvement has been made in Saudi Arabia. But you look at Iran, and they kill many, many people in Iran. You have the access and we have the access also. And Saudi Arabia also has a lot to do with economic development. They're a country that pays us a tremendous amount of money, creates a tremendous amount of jobs. And Saudi Arabia, I'm not making excuses for anybody. I think that was a terrible event. It was a terrible tragedy. It was a terrible crime.\nYeah. Khashoggi. I thought it was a terrible crime. But if you look at other countries, many other countries. You look at Iran, not so far away from Saudi Arabia, and take a look at what they're doing there. So you know, that's just the way I feel. Venezuela is very much in flux. We've been hearing about it for probably 14 years now, between the two of them. And some terrible things are happening in Venezuela. So if I can do something to help people. It's really helping humanity, if we can do something to help people, I'd like to do that.\nWe had a very good talk. Just more than anything else, I guess, I wished him good luck. It's a dangerous journey. He's in a very dangerous place. And it's a very dangerous journey. I watched him —\nNo. I didn't know Bill Barr, but I've always heard he was an outstanding man.\nAnd that's what I wanted for that position.\nI did hear the statement and it was totally acceptable to me. I just want somebody that's a very outstanding person and who's going to be — I think he has a chance to be a great attorney general.\nAnd they need it. They really need it. I mean they — You see what's happening. There's been turmoil between the Justice Department, the F.B.I. You look at all of the statements made. You look at all of the firings, not firings by me, by the way. But you look at all of the people that have left and been fired and terminated and all of the terrible statements being made. And it is a terrible thing that's gone on there.\nVery little. I'll tell you what: What I talked about is the fact — I went into his past almost two years of being attorney general. I went into his life, as a, you know, after being the attorney general, which was very successful. He's had a very successful life, Bill Barr. He's very respected. I didn't know him, you know, until this whole situation — until, you know, it was time to look for an attorney general. So many people recommended him. So many people.\nAnd again this isn't somebody — and I think I probably would be able to put up somebody that I know very well. I mean Kennedy used his brother, and so I would have been able to. But I wanted somebody that was respected. I think that he did very well at the hearing, really well, as well as, some people say it was as good as you can do. And I think he'll be a great attorney general. I certainly hope so.\nI did not know that.\nI did not know. I mean, I read it afterwards. But I did not know.\nI didn't see the memo. I never read the memo.\nYeah.\nYeah, I did. I did. I've actually always gotten along with her, but now I don't think I will anymore. I think that she's hurting the country very badly. I think she's doing a tremendous disservice to the country. If she doesn't approve a wall, the rest of it's just a waste of money and time and energy because it's, it's desperately needed. People are flowing in.\nI mean, we have caravans coming in right now, 12,000 people. We have three of them lined up. And you know they're lining up from Honduras and Guatemala and El Salvador. And they're coming in.\nWith a wall, you don't need very much help. We just had to move more military down there to handle the one that's coming up now: 12,000 people or whatever it might be. But they say it's about 12,000 people.\nNo, I think Nancy Pelosi is hurting our country very badly by doing what she's doing. And ultimately I think I've set the table very nicely.\nWell, they understand, Peter. They didn't know what was going on with the southern border. Now they know. They had no idea the amount of crime, the amount of drugs, the amount of human trafficking, which can be stopped with a proper system —\nI've set the table. I've set the stage for doing what I'm going to do.\nYeah, I'm going to wait until the 15th. I think it's a waste of time —\nWell, based on everything I hear. Now they'll probably be overly generous with things that you don't need in terms of money. They'll give you more money than you need for things that won't help very much. And they'll give you money for good things, too. But based on what I hear and based on what I read, they don't want to give money for the wall.\nYou know I'm building the wall. You know that. I'm building the wall right now. I'm building — it's been funded, and we're buying it right. And we're renovating large sections of wall. We're building new sections of wall. We're building the wall. The wall is going up as we speak. We'll be up to, by the end of this year, 115 miles.\nAt least.\nAnd that doesn't include large amounts of wall that we'll be starting before the end of the year. So we'll be up to hundreds of miles of wall between new wall and renovation wall in a fairly short period of time. It's the one thing. So I'm building the wall now, as we speak. And I'll continue to build the wall, and we'll get the wall finished. Now whether or not I declare a national emergency, that you'll see.\nWell, you'll have to see, I mean you'll have to see. And you should call Dan and you should call Gina. I would like you to. You know them [inaudible].\nI don't.\nWell, first of all, when I walked into the room, there's your picture, I guess you have it. [Hands reporters a photograph of intelligence chiefs meeting with him.] But when I walked into the room, I said, \"What's the story with Iran?\"\n\"We were totally misrepresented.\"\nI said, \"What are you talking about?\"\nWell, you have to really take a look at everybody else. And if you would have been here today, and you would have seen this whole side of the room filled up with secretaries and people that are running government, you would have said, I don't get, I don't have a problem with anybody. I don't dispute anything.\nYou're talking about very little by comparison to the people that we're talking about. Great relationship with Mike Pompeo. That was a great choice. Great relationship with — Sonny Perdue is fantastic. Agriculture. He was very happy because China said we're going to buy tremendous amounts of farm products, O.K., agriculture products, in front of him. It was a gesture — a very big gesture — but it was a gesture. Very substantial amount of product. And he said he's starting today, which is pretty amazing. You know we're not going to have an agreement for a little while yet, if we have an agreement.\nSo when you look at the overall government, there's really very little dispute.\nI mean Sarah, could I ask you two to speak up about that?\nYou have a lot of people that are in from other administrations that frankly you keep because you're not allowed to do anything but keep them, O.K.? And so they'll do reports. And by the way, you're going to have people that are from my administration in years from now that would be very critical of perhaps another president where they disagree with something.\nBut as you know, you have many, many people in this administration and every other administration that wasn't put there by me, and they have to stay there. It's a job for life.\nAnd they can be critical. And just like we put in a lot of great people, they'll be critical into the future. That doesn't happen at The New York Times.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-peter-baker-the-new-york-times-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Margaret Brennan of CBS News", "Date": "2019-02-03", "Text": "Well, I don't- I don't take anything off the table. I don't like to take things off the table. It's that alternative. It's national emergency, it's other things and you know there have been plenty national emergencies called. And this really is an invasion of our country by human traffickers. These are people that are horrible people bringing in women mostly, but bringing in women and children into our country. Human trafficking. And we're going to have a strong border. And the only way you have a strong border is you need a physical barrier. You need a wall. And anybody that says you don't, they're just playing games.\nWell, I think that she was very rigid - which I would expect - but I think she is very bad for our country. She knows that you need a barrier. She knows that we need border security. She wanted to win a political point. I happen to think it's very bad politics because basically she wants open borders. She doesn't mind human trafficking or she wouldn't do this because you know--\nExcuse me?\nShe's- she's costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars because what's happening is when you have a porous border, and when you have drugs pouring in, and when you have people dying all over the country because of people like Nancy Pelosi who don't want to give proper border security for political reasons, she's doing a terrible disservice to our country. And on the 15th we have now set the table beautifully because everybody knows what's going on because of the shutdown. People that didn't have any idea- they didn't have a clue as to what was happening, they now know exactly what's happening. They see human trafficking. They see drugs and gangs and criminals pouring in. Now, we catch them because we're doing a great job. But if we had proper border security we wouldn't have to work so hard and we could do an even better job, and I think Nancy Pelosi is doing a terrible disservice to the people of our country. But she can--\nNo, she can keep playing her games, but we will win. Because we have a much better issue. On a political basis, what she's doing is- I actually think it's bad politics, but much more importantly it's very bad for our country.\nI did.\nI think- let me just say it wasn't so much a report. It was the questions and answers as the report was submitted and they were asked questions and answers. We've done an incredible job with Syria. When I took over Syria it was infested with ISIS. It was all over the place. And now you have very little ISIS and you have the caliphate almost knocked out. We will be announcing in the not too distant future 100 percent of the caliphate which is the area- the land- the area- 100. We're at 99 percent right now, we'll be at 100. When I took it over it was a disaster. I think we've done a great job with that. At the same time, at a certain point, we want to bring our people back home. If you look at Afghanistan we're going in very soon we'll be going into our 19th year spending 50 billion dollars a year. Now if you go back and look at any of my campaign speeches or rallies, I talked about it all the time.\n--I want to bring people home.\nYou're going to always have pockets of something. What-- you're going to have people, like the one armed man who blew up a restaurant. You're going to have pockets. But you're not going to keep armies there because you have a few people. Or you even have fairly reasonable numbers of people. We've been there for many, many years. We were supposed to be in Syria for four months. We've been there for years. We have been in Afghanistan for 19 years. And by the way, I've been hitting very hard in Afghanistan and now we're negotiating with the Taliban. We'll see what happens, who knows--\nLook, whether we should have been there in the first place, that's first question. Second question--\n--we've been there for 19 years, almost, we are fighting very well. We're fighting harder than ever before. And I think that they will- I think they're tired and, I think everybody's tired. We got to get out of these endless wars and bring our folks back home. Now, that doesn't mean we're not going to be watching with intelligence. We're going to be watching, and watching closely. North Korea--\nWell, everything's harder. But, you know you pay a big price for troops on the ground. We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars on military. We're the policemen of the world and we don't--\nSure.\nAnd you know what we'll do? We'll come back if we have to. We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly, and I'm not leaving. We have a base in Iraq and the base is a fantastic edifice. I mean I was there recently, and I couldn't believe the money that was spent on these massive runways. And these- I've rarely seen anything like it. And it's there. And we'll be there. And frankly, we're hitting the caliphate from Iraq and as we slowly withdraw from Syria. Now the other thing--\n2,000 troops.\nThey're starting to, as we gain the remainder, the final remainder of the caliphate of the area, they'll be going to our base in Iraq, and ultimately some will be coming home. But we're going to be there and we're going to be staying--\nWe have to protect Israel. We have to protect other things that we have. But we're- yeah, they'll be coming back in a matter of time. Look, we're protecting the world. We're spending more money than anybody's ever spent in history, by a lot. We spent, over the last five years, close to 50 billion dollars a year in Afghanistan. That's more than most countries spend for everything including education, medical, and everything else, other than a few countries.\nYes. And I'll leave intelligence there. Real intelligence, by the way. I'll leave intelligence there and if I see nests forming, I'll do something about it. But for us to be spending 51 billion dollars, like last year, or if you average the cost it's- I mean you're talking about numbers that nobody's ever heard of before.\nI ran against 17 Republicans. This was a big part of what I was saying, and I won very easily. I think the people out in the world- I think people in our country agree. We've been fighting for 19 years. Somebody said you were precipitously bringing to- precipitously? We've been there for 19 years. I want to fight. I want to win, and we want to bring our great troops back home. I've seen the people. I go to Walter Reed Hospital. I see what happens to people. I see with no legs and no arm- arms. And I've seen also what happens to them up here because they're in this situation, and they come back and they are totally different people-- where the wives and the fathers and the mothers say, \"What has happened to my son? What has happened in some cases to my daughter?\" It's a terrible thing. We've been there close to 19 years. And it's time. And we'll see what happens with the Taliban. They want peace. They're tired. Everybody's tired. We'd like to have- I don't like endless wars. This war. What we're doing is got to stop at some point.\nI'm not telegraphing anything. No, no, no. There's a difference. When President Obama pulled out of Iraq in theory we had Iraq. In other words, we had Iraq. We never had Syria because President Obama never wanted to violate the red line in the sand. So we never had Syria. I was the one that actually violated the red line when I hit Syria with 59 Tomahawk missiles, if you remember. But President Obama chose not to do that. When he chose not to do that, he showed tremendous weakness. But we didn't have Syria whereas we had Iraq. So when he did what he did in Iraq, which was a mistake. Being in Iraq was a mistake. Okay. Being in Iraq- it was a big mistake to go- one of the greatest mistakes going into the Middle East that our country has ever made. One of the greatest mistakes that we've ever made--\n--but when it was chosen-- well, we spent a fortune on building this incredible base. We might as well keep it. And one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want to be looking a little bit at Iran because Iran is a real problem.\nNo, because I want to be able to watch Iran. All I want to do is be able to watch. We have an unbelievable and expensive military base built in Iraq. It's perfectly situated for looking at all over different parts of the troubled Middle East rather than pulling up. And this is what a lot of people don't understand. We're going to keep watching and we're going to keep seeing and if there's trouble, if somebody is looking to do nuclear weapons or other things, we're going to know it before they do.\nI am going to trust the intelligence that I'm putting there, but I will say this: my intelligence people, if they said in fact that Iran is a wonderful kindergarten, I disagree with them 100 percent. It is a vicious country that kills many people. When you talk about torture and so many other things. And- maybe they'll come back. The country is getting absolutely- when I ended the horrible Iran nuclear deal- it was a horrible deal done by President Obama and John Kerry that didn't know what the hell he was doing. When I ended that deal, Margaret, all of a sudden Iran became a different country. They became- very rapidly- right now they're a country that's in big financial trouble. Let's see what happens.\nI disagree with them. I'm- I'm- by the way--\n--I have intel people, but that doesn't mean I have to agree. President Bush had intel people that said Saddam Hussein--\n--in Iraq had nuclear weapons- had all sorts of weapons of mass destruction. Guess what? Those intel people didn't know what the hell they were doing, and they got us tied up in a war that we should have never been in. And we've spent seven trillion dollars in the Middle East and we have lost lives--\nI do, and I respect John and John is not one of the people that happened to be testifying or on.\nAnd you know what I tell people- you can testify any way you want. I'm not going to stop them from testifying. They said they were mischaracterized-- maybe they were maybe they weren't, I don't really know-- but I can tell you this, I want them to have their own opinion and I want them to give me their opinion. But, when I look at Iran, I look at Iran as a nation that has caused tremendous problems.\nWhen I came in as president of the United States, my first year, I went to the Pentagon two weeks after I came in, a short time after, and I was given a- because I wanted to know what's going on with Iran.\nWe were in many many locations in the Middle East in huge difficulty. Every single one of them was caused by the number one terrorist nation in the world which is Iran. So when my intelligence people tell me how wonderful Iran is- if you don't mind, I'm going to just go by my own counsel.\nSo we have a great cabinet. I have great people. I think now we have a really great cabinet. I think Bill Barr will be a fantastic attorney general, and I think that we have- Mike Pompeo's been doing a fantastic job. We have—\nNo, I don't- I mean he tells me he wouldn't want to leave. I think that was--\nThat was fake news.\nWell, he may have spoken to him, but I think he loves being secretary of state. He's doing a fantastic job. And I asked him the question the other day, he says he's absolutely not leaving. I don't think he'd do that. And he doesn't want to be lame duck. And he's doing a fantastic job as our secretary of state. Great energy and great- a great, smart gentleman.\nYes.\nIt's OK. It's easier to make moves when they're acting.\nSome, and some not.\nSome are doing a fantastic job. Really- I like acting because I can move so quickly. It gives me more flexibility. But- but actually, some of the names you mentioned, they're doing a fantastic job.\nWhen it's not happening. When--\nWhen it doesn't get done. Like with General Mattis, I wasn't happy with his service. I told him give me a letter.\nHe resigned because I asked him to resign. He resigned because I was very nice to him. But I gave him big budgets and he didn't do well in Afghanistan. I was not happy with the job he was doing in Afghanistan. And if you look at Syria what's happened, I went to Iraq recently, if you look at Syria, what's happened in Syria in the last few weeks, you would see that things are going down that were not going down. That things are happening that are very good. So I was not happy with him, but I wish him well.\nI think so. I mean I- I was just one that felt very important, you can't be kneeling for the national anthem. You have to respect our flag and our country. I want that as president and I'd want that as a citizen. And I have a very good relationship. I did them a big favor in negotiating the USMCA, which is basically the replacement to NAFTA, which is one of the worst trade deals ever made. And I said to Canada, look we have a great American company known as the NFL, and they were being hurt and treated unfairly, the NFL, by Canada for a long time. And I said to Prime Minister Trudeau, who was very nice about it and really understood it, I hope you can settle the difference immediately and fast. And they did. So I did the NFL a big favor, as a great American company and they appreciated it. And Roger Goodell, this is a dispute that has gone on for years. Roger Goodell called me and he thanked me. And I appreciated that. But they haven't been kneeling and they have been respecting the flag and their ratings have been terrific ever since. And a lot of good things happened.\nWell, you know, I'm the one that had passed judicial reform. And if you look at what I did, criminal judicial reform, and what I've done- President Obama tried. They all tried. Everybody wanted to do it. And I got it done and I've been, you know, really- a lot of people in the NFL have been calling and thanking me for it.\nThey have been calling and thanking, you know, that people have been trying to get that taken care of and it's now signed into law and affects tremendous numbers of people, and very good people. I think that when you want to protest I think that's great. But I don't think you do it at the sake of our flag, at the sake of our national anthem. Absolutely.\nA lot of it is having to do with reform from what I understand. Whether it's criminal justice or whatever it may be and they have different versions and everybody seemed to have a different version of it. But a lot of it had to do with that, and I took care of that. I think that people have to, at all times, respect our flag and at all times respect our net- our- our national anthem and our country. And I think there are plenty of places and times you can protest and you can do a lot. But you can't do that. That's my opinion.\nWhat has happened is very interesting. The economy is so good right now. You saw the jobs report just came out. Three hundred and four thousand added jobs, which is a shocker, for the month. A shocker to a lot of people. They thought it was going to be half that number. The African-Americans have the best employment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic Americans have the best employment numbers in the history of our country. Asian-Americans the best in the history of our country. You look at women, the best in 61 years. And our employment numbers are phenomenal, the best in over 50 years. So I think I've been given a lot of credit for that. And in terms of race, a lot of people are saying well this is something very special what's happening.\nI have a great relationship with Tim and certainly with his state, South Carolina, and- where we do very well. And I think if you look at the numbers for African-American unemployment, best numbers they've had- literally the best numbers they've had in history. And I think they like me a lot and I like them a lot.\nIt's very, it's very tough question. It's a very good question. If he wanted to? Yes. Would I steer him that way? No, I wouldn't.\nI wouldn't. And he actually plays a lot of soccer. He's liking soccer. And a lot of people, including me, thought soccer would probably never make it in this country, but it really is moving forward rapidly. I- I just don't like the reports that I see coming out having to do with football—I mean, it's a dangerous sport and I think it's- I- it's- really tough, I thought the equipment would get better, and it has. The helmets have gotten far better but it hasn't solved the problem. So, you know I- I hate to say it because I love to watch football. I think the NFL is a great product, but I really think that as far as my son- well I've heard NFL players saying they wouldn't let their sons play football. So. It's not totally unique, but I- I would have a hard time with it.\nWell, look the Russia thing is a hoax. I have been tougher on Russia than any president, maybe ever. But than any president.\nExcuse me. Ok, you ready? Ok, you ready? Of the 34 people, many of them were bloggers from Moscow or they were people that had nothing to do with me, had nothing to do with what they're talking about or there were people that got caught telling a fib or telling a lie. I think it's a terrible thing that's happened to this country because this investigation is a witch hunt. It's a terrible witch hunt and it's a disgrace--\n--when you look at General Flynn where the FBI said he wasn't lying, but Robert Mueller said he was, and they took a man and destroyed his life. When you look at so many of the things that have happened- why didn't they go after Hillary Clinton for her emails? She had thirty three thousand emails that were deleted after receiving a subpoena from Congress--\nFirst of all, Roger Stone didn't work on the campaign, except way way at the beginning long before we're talking about. Roger is somebody that I've always liked, but a lot of people like Roger some people probably don't like Roger, but Roger Stone's somebody I've always liked. I mean Roger's a character but Roger was not- I don't know if you know this or not- Roger wasn't on my campaign except way at the beginning--\nSo, it's all- and- and yet you will ask me a question like that, wasn't involved in my campaign.\nI have not thought about it. It looks like he's defending himself very well. But you have to get rid of the Russia witch hunt because it is indeed. And remember--\nRemember this. Remember this. There's been no president that has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.\nTotally up to to the Attorney General.\nEven the Mueller report said it had nothing to do with the campaign. When you look at some of the people and the events it had nothing to do--\nExcuse me.\nExcuse me. That's up to the attorney general. I don't know. It depends. I have no idea what it's going to say.\nSo far this thing's been a total witch hunt. And it doesn't implicate me in any way. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction. There was no nothing. Doesn't implicate me in any way but I think it's a disgrace.\nWell I don't want to say that. But certainly it's something that's on the- it's an option.\nWell he is requested a meeting and I've turned it down because we're very far along in the process. You have a young and energetic gentleman but you have other people within that same group that have been very very - if you talk about democracy - it's really democracy in action.\nWe're going to see what happened. A number of months ago he wanted to meet.\nWell now we'd have to see.\nI would say this. I decided at the time, \"no\" because so many really horrible things have been happening in Venezuela when you look at that country. That was the wealthiest country of all in that part of the world which is a very important part of the world. And now you look at the poverty and you look at the anguish and you look at the crime and you look at all of the things happening. So, I think the process is playing out - very very big tremendous protests.\nI won't tell you yet, but you'll be finding out probably State of the Union or shortly before. But the meeting is set. He's looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. We've made tremendous progress. If you remember, before I became president, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. Now we have a very good relationship. The hostages are back. Okay, the remains are starting to come back. The remains of our Korean War veterans--\n--there's a good possibility of that too. But there's also a very good chance that we will make a deal. I think he's also tired of going through what he's going through. He has a chance to have North Korea be a tremendous economic behemoth. It has a chance to be one of the great economic countries in the world. He can't do that with nuclear weapons and he can't do that on the path they're on now. I like him. I get along with him great. We have a fantastic chemistry. We have had tremendous correspondence that some people have seen and can't even believe it. They think it's historic. And we'll see what happens. Now that doesn't mean we're going to make a deal. But certainly I think we have a very good chance of making a deal. And one of the reasons is because North Korea has a chance being located between Russia, China, and South Korea. What a location- I'm in the real estate business- what a location. They have a chance to be an economic powerhouse.\nYeah, I mean we haven't talked about anything else. Maybe someday. I mean who knows. But you know it's very expensive to keep troops there. You do know that. We have 40,000 troops in South Korea, it's very expensive. But I have no plans, I've never even discussed removing them.\nWell, yes but I think we're in a different position now.\nWe've put very massive tariffs on China. China is paying a big price and it's hurt China's economy very badly. I want them to make a fair deal.They have been very helpful, especially at the beginning when I first came in with North Korea. They have stopped goods from going in. They have stopped a lot of things from going in through the border. Because as you know they have a border just like we have a border with Mexico, where crime is way up by the way, way up, and you have to remember that. But we have a border with- they have a border with North Korea.\nThey have been very vigilant. Are they the same now? Probably a little bit less so. But North Korea is absolutely talking. And I think North Korea wants to make a deal. We are making a deal. It looks like we're doing very well with making a deal with China. I can tell you this, no two leaders of this country and China have ever been closer than I am with President Xi. We have a good chance to make a deal. I don't know that we're going to make one, but we have a good chance. And if it is a deal it's going to be a real deal. It's not going to be a stopgap.\nThank you very much, Margaret.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-margaret-brennan-cbs-news"}
{"Title": "Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union", "Date": "2019-02-05", "Text": "The President.Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.\nMillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great Chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties, but as one Nation. The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It's the agenda of the American people.\nMany of us have campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of health care and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern, and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.\nThere is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage, together, to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country.\nThis year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission and the power of American pride.\nIn June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade, the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Please. Gentlemen, we salute you.\nIn 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the Moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of theApollo 11astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. Thank you, Buzz. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\nIn the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, redefined the middle class, and when you get down to it, there's nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with America. Now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within reach.\nWe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. But we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.\nTogether, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make. We must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. Tonight I ask you to choose greatness.\nOver the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom, a boom that has rarely been seen before. There's been nothing like it. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and, importantly, added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, something which almost everyone said was impossible to do. But the fact is, we are just getting started.\nWages are rising at the fastest pace in decades and growing for blue-collar workers, who I promised to fight for. They're growing faster than anyone else thought possible. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The U.S. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office. And we are considered, far and away, the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Not even close.\nUnemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. African American, Hispanic American, and Asian American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an alltime low. More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country: 157 million people at work.\nWe passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. We virtually ended the estate tax—or death tax, as it is often called—on small businesses, for ranchers, and also for family farms. We eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty. And to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed, very importantly, \"right to try.\"\nMy administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations. And we have unleashed a revolution in American energy. The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\nAfter 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on Earth, by far, and America is again winning each and every day. Members of Congress: The state of our union is strong.\nAudience members.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President.That sounds so good. [Laughter]\nOur country is vibrant, and our economy is thriving like never before. On Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone, almost double the number expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous, partisan investigations. If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. [Laughter] It just doesn't work that way.\nWe must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. This new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate, in some cases, years and years waiting. Not right. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country. Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that that's possible. In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic VA reforms. And after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\nAnd just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. They said it couldn't be done. Last year, I heard, through friends, the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time nonviolent drug offender. Over the next 22 years, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond.\nAlice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice. She served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life.\nIn June, I commuted Alice's sentence. When I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did something right. Alice is with us tonight, and she is a terrific woman. Terrific. Alice, please. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny. Thank you very much, Alice. Thank you very much.\nInspired by stories like Alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. Big deal. It's a big deal. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African American community. The First Step Act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now States across the country are following our lead. America is a nation that believes in redemption.\nWe are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at the age of 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored many of his fellow inmates. Now Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, please. Thank you, Matthew. Welcome home.\nNow Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our very dangerous southern border. Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\nAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught.\nThis is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well-being of all America. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally. Tonight I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country. No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\nMeanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded you can't get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net. Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate; it is actually very cruel.\nOne in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide-open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.\nTens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities, including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.\nThe savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands. But until we secure our border, they're going to keep streaming right back in.\nYear after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I've gotten to know many wonderful Angel moms and dads and families. No one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure.\nHere tonight is Debra Bissell. Just 3 weeks ago, Debra's parents Gerald and Sharon were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter Heather and great-granddaughter Madison.\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand. Few can understand your pain. Thank you. And thank you for being here. Thank you very much. I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\nIn the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings or murders. We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin—[applause]—thank you. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of 8, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking.\nElvin says that \"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've really done my job.\" Thanks to his work, and that of his incredible colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation, and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars. Thank you, Elvin. We will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement, and I pledge to you tonight that I will never abolish our heroes from ICE. Thank you.\nMy administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry.\nIn the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier, not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need. And these agents will tell you: Where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down.\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime, one of the highest in the entire country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of the safest cities in our country. Simply put: Walls work, and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.\nAs we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.\n[At this point, Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress, Cabinet members, and attendees in a standing ovation.]\nYou weren't supposed to do that. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. [Laughter]\nAll Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.\n[Democratic Congresswomen joined other Members of Congress and others in another standing ovation.]\nDon't sit yet. You're going to like this. [Laughter]\nAnd exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.\nAudience members.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President.That's great. Really great. And congratulations. That's great.\nAs part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first-ever Governmentwide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\nTo build on—[applause]—thank you. To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. So bad.\nWe are now making it clear to China that, after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end. Therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, and now our Treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars.\nBut I don't blame China for taking advantage of us; I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs. [Applause] Thank you.\nAnother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA. I have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by the signing of NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal, but no one ever tried, until now.\nOur new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the USMCA, will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers like they haven't had delivered to for a long time. I hope you can pass the USMCA into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers, expand American agriculture, protect intellectual property, and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A.\nTonight I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us.\nBoth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure. I know that Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill, and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting-edge industries of the future. This is not an option, this is a necessity.\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with preexisting conditions. Already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018, drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\nBut we must do more. It's unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, this is unfair, and together, we will stop it, and we'll stop it fast.\nI am asking Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients, finally. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down.\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. We have made incredible strides. Incredible. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America and beyond.\nTonight I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. Joining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday—[applause]. Hi, Grace. [Laughter] Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude's Children's Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. That's what happened.\nLast year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered—they loved her; they still love her—with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: \"Last day of chemo.\" Thank you very much, Grace. You are a great inspiration to everyone in this room. Thank you very much.\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical lifesaving research.\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for Americans' children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\nAudience member.Yes!\nThe President.There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and their dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth.\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All children—born and unborn—are made in the holy image of God.\nThe final part of my agenda is to protect American security. Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States military, with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year.\nWe are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. Finally. [Applause] Finally. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO. But now we have secured, over the last couple of years, more than $100 billion of increase in defense spending from our NATO Allies. They said it couldn't be done.\nAs part of our military buildup, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.\nUnder my administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.\nFor example, decades ago, the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability. While we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. It's been going on for many years. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty. Perhaps—[applause]—we really have no choice. Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't, in which case, we will outspend and outinnovate all others by far.\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate Government of Venezuela and its new President, Juan Guaidó. We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom, and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.\nHere in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\nAudience members.Boo!\nThe President.America was founded on liberty and independence and not Government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.\nAudience members.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President.Tonight we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\nAudience members.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President.One of the most complex set of challenges we face, and have for many years, is in the Middle East. Our approach is based on principled realism, not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of Israel and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East.\nAs a candidate for President, I loudly pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars. When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria, just 2 years ago. Today, we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty monsters. Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach—if possible—a political settlement in Afghanistan. The opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor. And thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict.\nIn Afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop's presence and focus on counterterrorism. And we will indeed focus on counterterrorism. We do not know whether we'll achieve an agreement, but we do know that, after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. And the other side would like to do the same thing. It's time.\nAbove all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, violent terrorists attacked the USSCole. And last month, American forces killed one of the leaders of that attack.\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom, we vow to always remember the heroes of the USSCole. Thank you, Tom.\nMy administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran. It is a radical regime. They do bad, bad things. To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country.\nWe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants \"Death to America\" and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. And he was very successful. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery, and he is going in for many more. But he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson, please. Thank you. We are forever grateful. Thank you very much.\nTonight we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor, Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall, more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday.\n[Audience members sang \"Happy Birthday.\"]\nThe President.[Laughter] Great.\nPittsburgh, PA, resident Judah Samet.Thank you! [Laughter]\nThe President.They wouldn't do that for me, Judah. [Laughter]\nJudah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly, the train screeched to a very strong halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the absolute worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \"It's the Americans! It's the Americans!\" [Applause] Thank you.\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \"To me,\" Joshua recalls, \"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.\" They came down from Heaven. I began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of the American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on Earth.\nAlmost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight, seated side by side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua, your presence this evening is very much appreciated. Thank you very much. [Applause] Thank you.\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. They did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation and generations yet unborn.\nWhy did they do it? They did it for America. They did it for us. Everything that has come since—our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice—all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.\nThink of this Capitol. Think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways and defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, and to face down evil empires.\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.\nWhat will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us. Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.\nWe must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them. We must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.\nThis is the time to reignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. This is our future, our fate, and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness. No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.\nWe must keep America first in our hearts, we must keep freedom alive in our souls, and we must always keep faith in America's destiny that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-26"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Hanoi, Vietnam", "Date": "2019-02-28", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. I want to begin by thanking the Prime Minister and President of Vietnam. We're in Hanoi. It's an incredible city. And what's happened over the last 25 years has been incredible for the people of Vietnam. The job they've done—economic development—really something special. So I want to thank all of the people of Vietnam for having treated us so well.\nWe have, I think, reasonably attractive news from Pakistan and India. They've been going at it, and we've been involved in trying to have them stop. And we have some reasonably decent news. I think, hopefully, that's going to be coming to an end. It's been going on for a long time, decades and decades. There's a lot of dislike, unfortunately. So we've been in the middle, trying to help them both out, see if we can get some organization and some peace. And I think, probably, that's going to be happening.\nWe have—Venezuela, as you know, has been very much in the news, and we're sending supplies. Supplies are getting through a little bit more. It's not easy. It's hard to believe somebody would say, \"Let's not do it.\" What difference would that make, except it's great for its people to let it get through. But we're sending a lot of supplies down to Venezuela. People are starving to death, and you would really think that the man in charge, currently, would let those supplies get through. We are getting them into some of the cities and some of the areas that need them the most. And it's not an easy job. It's very difficult, actually.\nOn North Korea, we just left Chairman Kim. We had a really, I think, a very productive time. We thought, and I thought, and Secretary Pompeo felt that it wasn't a good thing to be signing anything. I'm going to let Mike speak about it.\nBut we literally just left. We spent pretty much all day with Kim Jong Un, who is—he's quite a guy and quite a character. And I think our relationship is very strong. But at this time—we had some options, and at this time, we decided not to do any of the options. And we'll see where that goes.\nBut it was a very interesting 2 days. And I think, actually, it was a very productive 2 days. But sometimes, you have to walk, and this was just one of those times. And I'll let Mike speak to that for a couple of minutes, please.\nSecretary of State Michael R. Pompeo.Thank you, Mr. President. We had been working, our teams—the team that I brought to bear, as well as the North Koreans—for weeks to try and develop a path forward so at the summit we could make a big step, a big step along the way towards what the two leaders had agreed to back in Singapore, in June of last year.\nWe made real progress. And indeed, we made even more progress when the two leaders met over the last 24, 36 hours. Unfortunately, we didn't get all the way. We didn't get to something that ultimately made sense for the United States of America. I think Chairman Kim was hopeful that we would. We asked him to do more. He was unprepared to do that. But I'm still optimistic. I'm hopeful that the teams will get back together in the days and weeks ahead and continue to work out what's a very complex problem. We have said, since the beginning, that this would take time. Our teams have gotten to know each other better. We know what the limits are. We know where some of the challenges are. And I think as we continue to work on this in the days and weeks ahead, we can make progress so that we can ultimately achieve what it is that the world wants, which is to denuclearize North Korea, to reduce risk for the American people and the people all around the world.\nI wish we could have gotten a little bit further, but I'm very optimistic that the progress that we made—both in the runup to this summit, as well as the progress that the two leaders made over these past 2 days—put us in position to get a really good outcome.\nAnd the President and Chairman Kim both felt good that they had made that progress, but couldn't quite get along the line any further to make a deal that would have been bigger at this point. I hope we'll do so in the weeks ahead.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThank you.\nAll right, Major [Major Garrett, CBS News], please.\nYes.\nIt is about the sanctions. They——\nBasically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, and we couldn't do that. They were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted, but we couldn't give up all of the sanctions for that.\nSo we continue to work, and we'll see. But we had to walk away from that particular suggestion. We had to walk away from that.\nThey're in place. You know, I was watching as a lot of you folks over the weeks have said, \"Oh, we've given up\"—we haven't given up anything. And frankly, I think we'll end up being very good friends with Chairman Kim and with North Korea, and I think they have tremendous potential. I've been telling everybody: They have tremendous potential. Unbelievable potential. But we're going to see.\nBut it was about sanctions. I mean, they wanted sanctions lifted, but they weren't willing to do an area that we wanted. They were willing to give us areas, but not the ones we wanted.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News].\nNorth Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program Q.As we know, I mean, there's an incredibly complex set of issues that are at play here in terms of lifting the sanctions and what denuclearization is.\nRight.\nYes, we did. We did.\nYes.\nExcuse me, I don't want to comment on that exactly, but he has a certain vision, and it's not exactly our vision, but it's a lot closer than it was a year ago. And I think, you know, eventually we'll get there. But for this particular visit, we decided that we had to walk, and we'll see what happens. Okay?\nOh, look, we have a gentleman nobody has ever heard of that was—Sean Hannity [Sean Hannity, Fox News]. What are you doing here, Sean Hannity? Should we let him do a question? I don't know.\nYes, John, go ahead.\nYes.\nWith time. It will be bridged, I think, at a certain point. But there is a gap. We have to have sanctions. And he wants to denuke, but he wants to just do areas that are less important than the areas that we want. We know that—we know the country very well, believe it or not. We know every inch of that country. And we have to get what we have to get, because that's a big give.\nYes, Sean. Please.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations\nThank you.\nFormer Attorney to the President Michael D. Cohen's Congressional Testimony/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election\nWell, it's incorrect. And you know, it's very interesting, because I tried to watch as much as I could. I wasn't able to watch too much because I've been a little bit busy. But I think having a fake hearing like that and having it in the middle of this very important summit is really a terrible thing. They could've made it 2 days later or next week, and it would've been even better. They would've had more time.\nBut having it during this very important summit is sort of incredible. And he lied a lot, but it was very interesting, because he didn't lie about one thing. He said no collusion with the Russian hoax. And I said, \"I wonder why he didn't just lie about that, too, like he did about everything else?\"\nI mean, he lied about so many different things, and I was actually impressed that he didn't say, \"Well, I think there was collusion for this reason or that.\" He didn't say that. He said, \"No collusion.\" And I was, you know, a little impressed by that, frankly. Could've—he could've gone all out. He only went about 95 percent instead of 100 percent.\nBut the fact is, there is no collusion. And I call it the \"witch hunt.\" This should never happen to another President. This is so bad for our country. So bad. You look at this whole hoax, it's a—I call it the Russian witch hunt and now add the word \"hoax.\" It's a very, very bad thing for our country. But I was impressed with the fact that he—when—you know, because the most important question up there was the one on collusion. And he said he saw no collusion. So we'll see what happens. But it was pretty shameful, I think.\nYes, ma'am. Please. Please.\nGo ahead. How about one of you, instead of three?\nExcuse me. Excuse me. Person in the front. Go ahead.\nNo, no. No, not you. Excuse me. Yes, we'll get to you. Thank you.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations\nI think it was very good, very friendly. This wasn't a walk away, like you get up and walk out. No, this was very friendly. We shook hands. We—you know, there's a warmth that we have, and I hope that stays. I think it will.\nBut we are—you know, we're positioned to do something very special. This has been going on for many decades. This isn't me. You know, this was—this should've been solved during many Presidential runs. And you know, people talked about it; they never did anything. I get a kick out of so many people from past administrations telling me how to negotiate when they were there, in some cases, for 8 years; they did nothing.\nBut I think the relationship was very warm, and when we walked away it was a very friendly walk. Mike, you might want to speak to that for a second.\nIt's a very different system. I would say that's true.\nWe just like each other. I mean, we have a good relationship. Yes. It's a totally different system, to put it mildly. But we like each other. A good relationship.\nGo ahead. In the back. Go ahead.North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program\nYou always have to be prepared to walk. I could've signed an agreement today, and then you people would've said: \"Oh, what a terrible deal. What a terrible thing he did.\" No, you have be prepared to walk. And you know, we were—there was a potential we could've signed something today. I could've a hundred percent signed something today. We actually had papers ready to be signed, but it just wasn't appropriate. I want to do it right. I'd much rather do it right than do it fast.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go. First—go. Yes.\nYou have to speak up.\nWe discussed many ways. And the denuclearization is a very important—it's a very important word. Become a very well used word. And a lot of people don't know what it means, but to me it's pretty obvious: We have to get rid of the nukes.\nI think he's got a chance to have one of the most successful countries—rapidly, too—on Earth. Incredible country, incredible location. You're right between—if you think of it, you have, on one side, Russia and China, and on the other, you have South Korea, and you're surrounded by water and among the most beautiful shorelines in the world.\nThere is tremendous potential in North Korea, and I think he's going to lead it to a very important thing, economically. I think it's going to be an absolute economic power.\nI know, David.\nWell, some people, David, are saying that, and some people are denying that. They have shots from above—way above—and some people are saying that, and some people aren't. But I could've taken that out today, but I think you and others would've said we didn't get enough for what we'd be giving up. So—and you know, don't forget, we're partners with a lot of countries on this, if you think about it, with the sanctions. We have a whole big partnership with the United Nations and many countries, including Russia, China, and others. And then, of course, South Korea is very important to this whole thing, and Japan.\nI don't want to do something that is going to violate the trust that we've built up. We have a very strong partnership.\nI did. Yes. Absolutely.\nTotally.\nSure. Totally.\nHe would do that, but he wants the sanctions for that. And as you know, there's plenty left after that. And I just I felt it wasn't good. Mike and I spent a long time negotiating and talking about it to ourselves. And just—I felt that that particular, as you know, that facility, while very big, it wasn't enough to do what we were doing.\nWe had to have more than that, yes. We had to have more than that because there are other things that you haven't talked about, that you haven't written about, that we found. And we have to have—that was done a long time ago, but the people didn't know about.\nAnd we brought—yes.\nExactly. And we brought many, many points up that I think they were surprised that we knew. But we had to do more than just the one level. Because if we did the one level, and we gave up all of that leverage that's been taking a long time to build. And I want to tell you, by the way——\nDavid, I want to take off the sanctions so badly, because I want that country to grow. That country has got such potential, but they have to give up, or we could've done that deal.\nMike, do you want to speak to that?Secretary Pompeo.Yes. Only, David, there are also timing and sequencing issues that were associated with that as well, which we didn't quite get across the finish line as well. But remember, too, even that facility, even the Yongbyon facility and all of its scope—which is important, for sure—still leaves missiles, still leaves warheads and weapons systems. So there's a lot of other elements that we just couldn't get to.\nThat's right. Go ahead.\nThank you.\nNorth Korea's Nuclear Weapons Program/China-U.S. Trade\nYes. Yes. It's a good question. I don't want to say that to you, because I don't want to put myself in that position, from the standpoint of negotiation. But you know, we want a lot to be given up. And we're giving up.\nAnd we'll have to—you know, we'll be helping them along economically, us and other—many other countries are going to be helping. They're going to be in there. They're prepared to help. I can tell you: Japan, South Korea, I think China. So many.\nAnd speaking of China, we're very well on our way to doing something special, but we'll see. I mean, I am always prepared to walk. I'm never afraid to walk from a deal. And I would do that with China, too, if it didn't work out.\nWell, he said the testing—yes.\nHe said the testing will not start. He said that he's not going to do testing of rockets or missiles or anything having to do with nuclear. And all I can tell you is that's what he said. And we'll see.\nYes, go ahead. Please. Go ahead, please. In the back. Red. In the red.\nYes, thank you.\nChina/North Korea/Russia Q.Jessica Stone from CGTN. I have a question about China, as you were talking about. You talk about China being willing, potentially, to help economically. And the fact that you've talked—or will talk to Presidents Moon and Prime Minister Abe, how would you describe China's role in facilitating the engagement that's happened, so far, between Pyongyang and Washington?\nI think China has been a big help, bigger than most people know. On the border, as you know, 93 percent of the goods coming into North Korea come through China. So there's a great power there. At the same time, I believe—I happen to believe that North Korea is calling its own shots. They're not taking orders from anybody. He's a very strong guy. And they're able to do things that are pretty amazing. But 93 percent still come in from China. China has an influence, and China has been a big help.\nAnd Russia has been a big help too. As you know, there's a pretty small part of the border, but nevertheless significant, about 28 miles. And things can happen there too. And they've been a help.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nChina-U.S. Trade/U.S. Economy\nWe did talk about China today a lot. And he's getting along with China, and so are we. And we are—you know, we're—right now, you look at what's happened to our country; we've picked up trillions and trillions of dollars of net worth. Our stock market is almost at its alltime high. Our economy is incredible. Our unemployment numbers are among the best we've ever had in our history.\nIndividual groups like African American, women—you just take a look at any group; Hispanic, you saw that just came out—the best in history; African American, best in history. So many different numbers are coming out so good. So we have the strongest economy, probably, possibly that we've ever had.\nFiat Chrysler just announced that they're going to spend $4.5 billion right next to Detroit, in Michigan. They're building a tremendous plant. It's actually an expansion of another plant. It's going to be—it's going to double up their jobs and even more than that. A lot of great things are happening.\nAnd with China, they're having some difficulty, as you know. But I think that a lot of the difficulty is because of the tariffs that they're having. And in addition to that, we're putting a tremendous amount of money; you saw trade deficits went down last month. Everyone was trying to find out why. Well, we're taking in a lot of tariff money, and it's going right to the bottom line, and it has reduced the trade deficits.\nSo we'll see what happens with China. I think we have a very good chance. Their numbers are down. But I don't want that. I want their numbers—I want them to do great. But we've been losing anywhere from three hundred to five hundred billion dollars a year with China for many, many years. And again, like other things, many Presidents should have done this before me, and nobody did. So we're doing it.\nGo ahead. Go ahead, please.\nRight here. This gentleman.\nGood.\nWell, I like President Moon very much. We have a great relationship. Believe it or not, I have a great relationship with almost every leader. A lot of people find that hard to understand, but I do. But some take advantage of our country like you wouldn't believe. And when they know I know it—which I know in every case—maybe it sort of freezes them up a little bit. But we do; we have a lot of good relationships.\nWe'll be calling President Moon very soon, as soon as I get by the phone, on the plane. And he'll be one of the first calls. I'll be calling Prime Minister Abe of Japan, telling him about where we are and what we're doing. But I'll be making those calls.\nNo, he's working very hard. President Moon is working very hard. He'd love to see a deal, and he's been very helpful.\nOkay? Thank you. Go ahead, please.\nTo use China?\nWell, we do. I mean, China has been very helpful. President Xi is a great leader. He's a highly respected leader all over the world and especially in Asia. And he's helped us—Mike, I would say he's helped us a lot, right?\nWe've—I actually called him just recently to say, \"Hey, you know, whatever you can do on this.\" But he has been very helpful at the border, and he's been very, very helpful with, I think, North Korea generally. Could he be a little more helpful? Probably. But he's been excellent.\nGo ahead, please. No—yes, please.\nThat's okay. You're friends.North Korea-U.S. Relations\nNo, we haven't. No.\nWe'll see. If it happens, it happens. I have not committed.\nSouth Korea-U.S. Joint Military Exercises\nWell, you know, the military exercises, I gave that up quite a while ago because it costs us a hundred million dollars every time we do it. We fly these massive bombers in from Guam. And when I first started, a certain general said: \"Oh, yes, sir, we fly them in from Guam. It's right next door.\" Well, right next door is 7 hours away. And then, they come, and they drop millions of dollars of bombs, and then they go back and—but we would spend—I mean, we spent hundreds of millions of dollars on those exercises, and I hated to see it.\nI thought it was unfair. And frankly, I was, sort of, of the opinion that South Korea should help us with that. You know, we're protecting South Korea. I think they should help us with that. So those exercises are very expensive. And I was telling the generals—I said: Look, you know, exercising is fun, and it's nice, and I play—they play the war games. And I'm not saying it's not necessary, because at some levels it is, but at other levels, it's not. But it's a very, very expensive thing. And you know, we do have to think about that too.\nBut when they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on those exercises—and we don't get reimbursed—we're spending a tremendous amount of money on many countries, protecting countries that are very rich that can certainly afford to pay us and then some.\nAnd those countries—by the way, and those countries know that it's not right, but nobody has ever asked them before. But I've asked them, and we're doing—we're gaining a lot of money. We've picked up over a hundred billion dollars just in NATO over the last 2 years. A hundred billion dollars more has come in. And we're doing that with a lot of countries. You'll be seeing that a lot.\nYes, sir. Please.\nYes, one second, please.\nI do.Q.I'm wondering—you've talked about, this week, about Kim Jong Un being \"my friend\"—you called him on Twitter. You said you have a great relationship. Have you, in Singapore or here, confronted Kim Jong Un about Otto Warmbier's death——\nI have. I have.\nI have. And I have, and we have talked about it. And I really don't think it was in his interest at all. I know the Warmbier family very well. I think they're an incredible family. What happened is horrible. I really believe something very bad happened to him, and I don't think that the top leadership knew about it.\nAnd when they had to send him home—by the way, I got the prisoners back. I got the hostages back. And Otto was one of the hostages, but Otto came back in shape that was not even to be talked about. I find it—I thought it was horrible. Now, the others came back extremely healthy. But Otto came back in a condition that was just terrible.\nAnd I will—I did speak about it, and I don't believe that he would've allowed that to happen. Just wasn't to his advantage to allow that to happen. Those prisons are rough. They're rough places. And bad things happened. But I really don't believe that he was—I don't believe he knew about it.\nHe felt badly about it. I did speak to him. He felt very badly. But he knew the case very well, but he knew it later. And you know, you've got a lot of people. A big country. A lot of people. And in those prisons and those camps, you have a lot of people. And some really bad things happened to Otto. Some really, really bad things.\nHe tells me that he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead. Please. Please. Go ahead. In the back.\nNo, in the back. Behind you. Thank you.\nYou're going to have to speak a little louder. And where are you from? Where are you from?\nOkay.Q.Have you discussed the issue of possible inspections to North Korea's nuclear sites during your talks with the Chairman?\nWhy don't you answer that, Mike? I can't—I really——\nGood.\nI was worried about my hearing.\nOh, inspections.\nOh, inspections. Inspections on North Korea? Oh, we'd be able—yeah.\nWe'd be able to do that very easily. We have that set up, so we would be able to do that very easily.\nThe inspections on North Korea will take place, and we'll—if we do something with them—we have a schedule set up that is very good. We know things that, as David was asking about certain places and certain sites—there are sites that people don't know about that we know about. We would be able to do inspections, we think, very, very successfully.\nYes, ma'am. Please. Please.\nYes, go ahead. Please. Yes.\nA lot of people here, by the way. This is a big group of people.\nGo ahead.\nGood. Good.\nRight.\nWell, we hope. We hope. We're working hard on the peace plan, and we hope it will be good.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel/Arab-Israeli Peace Process\nWell, I just think he's been a great Prime Minister. And I don't know about his difficulty, but you're telling me something that, you know, the—people have been hearing about. But I don't know about that.\nI can say this: that he's done a great job as Prime Minister. He's tough, he's smart, he's strong. He is very defensive. His military has been built up a lot. They buy a lot of equipment from the United States, and they pay for it. Of course, we give them tremendous, as you know, subsidy, also. Four billion dollars is a lot each year. But they are—they've been very good. They've been incredible, actually, in many ways. But there is a chance for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\nAnd you know, it's interesting, all of my life, I've heard that the toughest of all deals—when they talk about tough deals; we all like deals—but the toughest of all deals would be peace between Israel and Palestinians. They say it's like the impossible deal. I'd love to be able to produce it. We'll see what happens.\nYou know, we were paying the Palestinians a lot of money. And I ended that about 2 years ago, because they weren't saying the right things. And I said, why would we pay somebody that's not saying nice things about us and not really wanting to go to the peace table? And they've been much better. And we'll see what happens.\nBut I think we really—I think we have, actually, a good shot at peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\nYes, go ahead. Please. Sir.\nNorth Korea-U.S. Relations/Japan-U.S. Trade\nYou have to go again.\nYea. I think we're going have—yes. I mean, we have very, very good relations. And by the way, speaking of—you mentioned Japan—we have a lot of good things happening Japan. We have trade talks started. For years, Japan has been sending millions and millions of cars in, and as you know, it's not been a very fair situation for the United States. We're starting trade talks with Japan. They actually started about 3 months ago, and I think we'll have a very good deal for the United States. But that's been a very unfair situation. Prime Minister Abe understands that, and that's fine.\nYes, sir.\nPlease. Back there.\nWell, I can't tell you. I mean, it might be soon. It might not be for a long time. I can't tell you. I would hope it would be soon. But it may not be for a long time.\nI could've done—I could've done a deal today, but it would've been a deal that wouldn't have been a deal that—it would've been something that I wouldn't have been happy about, Mike would not have been happy about. We had some pretty big options. But we just felt it wasn't appropriate, and we really want to do it right.\nYes, in the back. In the back. Yes, ma'am. Please.\nNo, I think the language was good all throughout. The language has been good even now. But you know, I don't go by language, because we had probably the toughest language in the history of diplomacy—if you call it diplomacy—at the beginning, and yet we became very friendly. I don't believe there was any tougher language ever than that.\n——and long before they had the kind of power that they have. But it wasn't. It should've been done by many—I'm not just blaming the Obama administration, which, by the way, it did nothing—nothing—absolutely on North Korea. It allowed things that happened, and to happen, that were very inappropriate. But I'm not blaming the Obama administration. I'm blaming many administrations. Something should've happened.\nBut I don't think the rhetoric has been bad at all. Initially, it was horrible, but now it's been very good.\nAll right, one more. How about you? Go ahead. Please. Please. Go ahead.\nI don't want to comment on that. I can just tell you this: that we have very strong sanctions. I don't want to talk about increasing sanctions. They're strong. They have a lot of great people in North Korea that have to live also. And that's important to me.\nAnd I would say this: My whole attitude changed a lot because I got to know, as you know, Chairman Kim very well. And they have a point of view also.\nSo I don't really want to talk about that. I just think that, hopefully, for the sake of South Korea, for the sake of Japan, and frankly, for the sake of China—I was talking to President Xi, who really is a man that gets the respect of a lot of people—I say, \"You can't love having a nuclear state right next to China.\" And he doesn't. He really doesn't. I will tell you, he would like to see that problem solved too. So that's it.\nWell, ladies and gentleman, I'm about to get on a plane and fly back to a wonderful place called Washington, DC. So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-hanoi-vietnam"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Jair Messias Bolsonaro of Brazil", "Date": "2019-03-19", "Text": "Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Today I'm very thrilled to welcome President Bolsonaro of Brazil for his first visit to the White House. President Bolsonaro, I want to congratulate you again on your tremendous election victory last October. It was an incredible feat and, really, a truly incredible challenge. And the end result was something the whole world was talking about.\nI also know that we're going to have a fantastic working relationship. We have many views that are similar. And we certainly feel very, very true to each other on trade. I think Brazil's relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it's ever been by far.\nI also want to congratulate you on your recovery from a truly horrible ordeal. It was an incredible recovery, and the people of your country know it. The great bravery you've shown—tremendous bravery.\nFor two centuries, the American and Brazilian people have been united by shared values, including an enduring love of faith and family and country. The United States was the first nation to recognize Brazil's independence in 1822. And in the Second World War, Brazil was the only South American country to contribute troops to the Allied war effort.\nToday, the United States and Brazil are the two largest democracies and economies in the Western Hemisphere. We're in close agreement on the incredible opportunities and continuing challenges facing our region. And we have a truly historic chance to forge even stronger ties between our two great nations.\nThis afternoon the President and I discussed many of our mutual priorities, including Venezuela. Brazil has been an extraordinary leader in supporting the Venezuelan people's efforts to reclaim their liberty and their democracy. Brazil has helped so much. Along with the United States, Brazil was one of the first nations to recognize Venezuela's legitimate Interim President, Juan Guaidó.\nI also want to express our profound gratitude to President Bolsonaro and all the Brazilian people for their efforts to provide humanitarian aid. We also thank you for allowing the United States to station extensive assistance and massive aid on the Brazilian border. The Brazilian people have been incredible.\nTogether, we could—and have been, really, very happy to—feed thousands and thousands of starving Venezuelans. The Venezuelan people have appreciated it. And if the Maduro forces would step aside, it could be a truly great and successful humanitarian project. We call on members of the Venezuelan military to end their support for Maduro, who is really nothing more than a Cuban puppet, and finally set their people free.\nThe United States and Brazil are also united in support of the long-suffering people of Cuba and Nicaragua. The twilight hour of socialism has arrived in our hemisphere. And hopefully, by the way, it's also arrived—that twilight hour—in our great country, which is doing better than it's ever done economically. The last thing we want in the United States is socialism.\nSo, President Bolsonaro, I will tell you that we'll be consulting and talking a lot. We'll be working on all of our both problems and assets. And we're making tremendous strides. We had a great meeting today.\nAs I told President Bolsonaro, I also intend to designate Brazil as a \"major non-NATO ally,\" or even possibly, if you start thinking about it, maybe a NATO ally—have to talk to a lot of people, but maybe a NATO ally—which will greatly advance security and cooperation between our countries.\nOur nations are already working together to protect our people from terrorism, transnational crime, and drugs and weapons trafficking. Also, human trafficking, which has really become something that has come to the forefront of crime. Horrible, horrible situation. We look forward to an even deeper partnership and working together.\nIn our meetings, we also discussed the strong economic ties between our nations, grounded in the principles of fairness and reciprocity. My favorite word: reciprocity. President Bolsonaro and I are both committed to reducing trade barriers, facilitating investment, and supporting innovation across a range of industries, particularly energy, infrastructure, agriculture, and technology.\nThe President's vision for freeing the private sector and opening the economy is the right way for Brazil to achieve strong economic growth. And our great companies are ready to go when that table is flat and free.\nTo improve our business relationships, we have revived the U.S.-Brazil CEO Forum, and we have started a new U.S.-Brazil Energy Forum. We welcome Brazil's aspirations to join Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a laudable goal and one that will make Brazil's status as a developing and developed country. We also hope that all of us will be able to work together, all nations.\nI'm also pleased to announce that after 20 years of talks, we are finalizing a Technology Safeguards Agreement to allow U.S. companies to conduct space launches from Brazil. It's actually an incredible location when you study it and when you see it. We won't go into it now. But because of the location, tremendous amounts of money would be saved. To put it very simply: The flights are a lot shorter.\nBrazil's proximity to the equator makes it an ideal launch location. My administration is committed to reviving America's proud legacy in space. We're looking very strongly, as you know, and working together with everybody on Space Force. And we are grateful for Brazil's partnership.\nSo we'll take a couple of questions.\nRoberta Rampton, please. Roberta. Reuters. Thank you.\nI'm not being told any specific time. They've been there a long time, between him and his predecessor. At some point, I would imagine, things will change. But we really haven't done the really tough sanctions yet. We can do the tough sanctions. And all options are open, so we may be doing that. But we haven't done the toughest of sanctions, as you know. We've done, I would say, right down the middle. But we can go a lot tougher if we need to do that.\nBut it's a very sad thing, and we're not looking for anything other than taking care of a lot of people that are starving and dying in the streets. What's happening there is a disgrace. This was one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and all of a sudden, it's just—it's grief stricken, poverty stricken, no food, no water, no air conditioning, no anything. No power for a long time last week. No power. And that's going to break down again, because it's being held together by threads.\nSo it's very sad, Roberta. Very sad to see. Okay?\nMr. President, please.\nSo, as I said, all options are open. I think of all possibilities. All options are open. We'll see what happens.\nAnd by the way, I see in the audience the son of the President who has been fantastic. Would you please stand up? The job you've done during a very tough period of time is just fantastic. And I know your father appreciates it, that I can tell you. Okay? Thank you very much. Fantastic job.\nSaagar Enjeti, from Daily Caller. Saagar.\nThank you.\nNo, I wouldn't entertain that. The only reason is—that they're doing that is they want to try and catch up. So if they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election, they want to try doing it in a different way. No, we would have no interest in that whatsoever. It will never happen. It won't happen—I guarantee it won't happen—for 6 years.\nThank you. I agree. [Laughter]\nMr. President, thank you very much. Our——\nYou look like a very nice person.\nGo ahead. Watch, this will be the killer of all time. Watch. [Laughter]\nWe will be supporting. We're going to have a great relationship in so many different ways. That's just a—just something that we're going to be doing in honor of the President and in honor of Brazil. We will be asking for things, but not necessarily having to do with that. I think we're just going to have a very fair relationship. Okay?\nThank you.\nOkay.\n[President Trump shook President Bolsonaro's hand.]\nThank you very much, Mr. President. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. And thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.\nChina-U.S. Trade\nChina is going very well. Talks with China are going very well.\nThank you, everybody. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-jair-messias-bolsonaro-brazil"}
{"Title": "Interview with Politico", "Date": "2019-05-10", "Text": "I have not. I have not. I would be disappointed in David if he did that. I guess historically people involved in campaigns go around. I mean, you know, if you look at anybody, anybody running for president. If they win, you always -- you start off with many people running and then you have a group of people that become known. And David was one of the people. David -- you know, many people helped us. Many, many people, you know, helped me to win. And I've studied history, and I see a lot of people do very well after wins. But, I don't know. I just -- You folks did a story on this story, others did a story. I would be disappointed if everything wasn't on the up and up.\nI just think so. Maybe I look at it like my race. If you remember, from the day I came down the escalator until the end of the primaries, I was in the number one position. I was center stage every debate. And you know, nobody came close. And I had -- I mean, I had a big lead pretty much from the beginning, and it got bigger, you know, as it went along, and as people started dropping out. And I look at it as analogous [to this year's Democratic primary] because we had 17 plus one. So we had 18, actually. You know we had Gilmore, if you remember.\nWhich a lot of people forget. But anyway, so we actually had 18 people. But they have – what do they have, 21, 22 people now, right? Something like that?\nSo it seems that -- it seems that many of them aren't registering, as happened with [20]16. It seems as if many of aren't registering with the public. And Biden – for whatever reason, I don't get that -- but he seems to be – you know, have some kind of a register. Whether it's name [recognition] or what. And he seems to be doing well. And Bernie seems to be going in the wrong direction. But everyone else is going -- I mean almost everybody else seems to be not doing very well. And so I would certainly say -- I make it analogous to my race in the sense that, you know, I rode it out. You know, they call it in sports: 'good frontrunner.' I don't know if Biden's a good frontrunner. I heard him talking about [how] he spoke to Margaret Thatcher yesterday. I mean, what he said is he spoke to Margaret Thatcher. I assume he meant Theresa May. So, I don't know, is that a good front runner? I don't know. That was a beauty.\nAlfred E. Neuman cannot become president of the United States.\nSo, you know, it's all based on high crimes and misdemeanors. And if you look at the Mueller report, there was no collusion. There was no conspiracy. And there was no obstruction. He said that in the first half of the sentence, and then said he couldn't prove it. But there was no obstruction. And then the attorney general, based on the facts, and the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, they ruled there was no obstruction. So you have no crime. And impeachment's based on crime. And, specifically it's based on high crimes and misdemeanors. Not 'plus' or whatever -- it's 'and' misdemeanors. Not separately, but together. So you need both.\nAnd, you know, look, I know it would be a very, very impossible thing. Plus, you know if you haven't had -- in fact, the crimes were actually committed, but they were committed by the Democrats. They were committed by the DNC, the Clinton campaign, Hillary Clinton. Those were the crimes. They weren't committed by us.\nSo I must say, you know you mentioned the word [impeachment], I haven't heard that word in a while. Because since the report came out, it said no collusion, no obstruction, no conspiracy. And that was the end. I haven't heard the word mentioned, really -- essentially -- since the Mueller report came out. And it's not like it's not like they were friends of mine.\nNo, I haven't spoken to him. And I'm very surprised by it because he went out about four weeks ago and said there is no collusion. So that's maybe a little bit different, you know, than what you're talking about. But I know that my son did testify. I know that [special counsel Robert] Mueller went over his testimony -- and very, very strongly went over his testimony -- and found that he did absolutely nothing wrong. That was an oppo research meeting. And I would say that everybody in Washington has had those meetings. You know, your opponent -- 'hey, we have information on your opponent. Would you like to hear?' I mean, you tell me how many politicians would turn that meeting down. And then it turned out she did that -- it turned out you didn't have any information.\nWell, not Republicans. It's a Republican.\nYeah. And I won the state of North Carolina and frankly had another Republican won [the primary], they would not have won the state. I have a great relationship to that state. So I was very surprised. He came in, ran along with me. I didn't know him well, but he ran along with me. So yeah, I was very surprised to see that.\nI don't know much about it yet. Just very briefly, he had mentioned -- and he's involved with a number of people that are looking into the whole thing because a lot of very bad, a lot of very bad things took place prior to the election. A lot of very, very bad things took place.\nYou know, they talk about 'investigate the investigators.' And when you look at what's happened with [Pete] Strzok and [Lisa] Page and [Andrew] McCabe and [James] Comey and all of the terrible things that took place, I think, you know. But I have not -- I have not spoken to [Giuliani] at any great length, but I will. When is he leaving? I don't even know. When is he leaving?\nI see. Well, I will speak to him about it before he leaves. I'm just curious about that.\nThat could be something also very separate. I will -- I'll speak to him before he leaves.\nWell, I haven't spoken to him about it. But certainly it is a very big issue and we'll see what happens. I have not spoken to him about it. Would I speak to him about it? I haven't thought of that. I mean, you're asking me a question I just haven't thought of. Certainly, it would be an appropriate thing to speak about. But I have not done that as of yet. It could be a very big -- it could be a very big situation. Of course, because he's because he's a Democrat, it's about one 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were Republican, it would be a lot bigger. But anyway, go ahead.\nNo. No. I'm not at all. They're short-range. They're short-range and I don't consider that a breach of trust at all. And you know, at some point I may. But at this at this point, no. These were short-range missiles and very standard stuff. Very standard.\nWell, this is -- actually, some of them weren't even missiles. Some of the things that they fired, they weren't even missiles. But this is short-range, and I don't consider it a breach of trust. I'll let you know when I do. I mean, it's possible that at some point I will. But right now, not at all.\nWell, the Russian collusion thing has turned out to be a total hoax, and now people are saying it. But I have not given any consideration to any of that at this moment.\nWell, I always liked Steve and I mean the last seven months or eight months, I mean, you can't have nicer statements stated about yourself than the things he's been saying about me, as you know.\n'The greatest of all time,' you know, etc., etc. But I haven't. You've seen what he's said on the various shows and you've seen what he's written. And that's very nice, and I appreciate it. But I haven't spoken to Steve in a while. Haven't spoken to Steve in a while.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-politico"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan in Tokyo, Japan", "Date": "2019-05-27", "Text": "Prime Minister Abe, the First Lady and I are profoundly honored to return to this very beautiful nation as Japan's first state guests following the enthronement of His Majesty the Emperor. On behalf of the United States, we want to thank the Imperial Family for this gracious invitation and warm welcome. It was really wonderful.\nMelania and I are thrilled to be back in the Land of the Rising Sun. It is a true privilege to take part in the splendor of this historic moment and to witness an ancient Japanese tradition as you begin the new imperial era. We look forward to seeing the new Emperor continue his father's extraordinary legacy.\nYesterday Melania and I were delighted to join you, Prime Minister, in attending a sumo tournament—I've always wanted to see a sumo tournament, so true—and they are bigger and stronger than I even thought—at your very impressive and new national arena, where I presented the first-ever U.S. President's Cup to the Sumo Grand Champion. That was something. This morning we participated in a magnificent welcome ceremony with their Majesties the Emperor and Empress at the grand Imperial Palace. Japan's time-honored customs and exquisite culture fill us with a deep sense of admiration. I want to thank all of the people of Japan for welcoming us to this week and sharing your beloved heritage. It is truly an incredible heritage.\nThis visit has also been a chance for Prime Minister Abe and me to strengthen our close friendship and the friendship between our two nations. The alliance between the United States and Japan is a cornerstone of stability and prosperity in the region and all around the world.\nThe Prime Minister and I continue our close consultation in pursuit of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. The essence of our approach is peace through strength. And this is a strong alliance indeed. The U.S.-Japan alliance is steadfast and ironclad. We want peace, and we want stability. We continue to hope that Chairman Kim seizes the opportunity to transform his country through denuclearization. It is a country with tremendous economic and other potential.\nThe United States also remains committed to the issue of abductions, which I know is a top priority for Prime Minister Abe. Earlier today I met for the second time with a group of Japanese families, who have suffered the unthinkable heartbreak of having their loved ones abducted by North Korea. The United States will continue to support Japan's efforts to bring these abductees home.\nOur nations are also cooperating on a number of other vital security issues. The United States supports Japan's efforts to improve its defense capabilities, and in recent months, we have greatly expedited the sale of large amounts of defense equipment to Japan, made in the United States. We make the best equipment in the world.\nIn 2018, Japan was one of the world's top purchasers of American defense equipment, and it has just announced its intent to purchase 105 brandnew F-35 stealth aircraft, stealth because, the fact is, you can't see them. [Laughter] This purchase would give Japan the largest F-35 fleet of any U.S. ally.\nAmerica and Japan's close security ties are grounded in shared values. Our armed forces train and serve together all around the world. Tomorrow I will visit American troops stationed alongside the Japanese Self-Defense Forces right here in Japan. On behalf of all Americans, I want to thank the Japanese people for graciously hosting our servicemembers and military families.\nThe United States and Japan are also working to improve our economic relationship based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity. We are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement that would benefit both of our economies. Our goal is to reduce our trade deficit with Japan, remove trade barriers, and barriers of all kinds so that U.S. exports will really have a fair and very profound footing.\nJust over 1 week ago, U.S. beef gained full access to Japanese markets for the first time since 2003. We hope to have even more to announce on the trade very, very soon.\nAnd finally, today I am pleased to confirm that Prime Minister Abe and I have agreed to dramatically expand our nations' cooperation in human space exploration. Japan will join our mission to send U.S. astronauts to space. We'll be going to the Moon. We'll be going to Mars very soon. It's very exciting. And from a military standpoint, there is nothing more important right now than space. This is an exciting starting point for greater collaboration on many other things.\nWell, first of all, let me say that I think that Kim Jong Un, or Chairman Kim, as some people say, is looking to create a nation that has great strength economically. I think he's very much—I talk to him a lot about it, and he's very much into the fact that—he believes, like I do, that North Korea has tremendous economic potential like perhaps few other developing nations anywhere in the world.\nAnd I think that he is looking to develop that way. He knows that, with nuclear, that's never going to happen. Only bad can happen. He understands that. He is a very smart man. He gets it well.\nSo I think that he is going to try, at some point. I'm in no rush at all. The sanctions remain. We have our hostages back. We, as you know, are getting the remains, continuing to get the remains. A lot of good things are happening.\nAnd, very importantly, there's been no nuclear testing for 2 years. I looked at a chart the other day. During the past administration, there were many numbers that were very high, like 10 and 12 and 18, having to do with missile launches and nuclear testing. And for the last 2 years, on the bottom, it had zero and zero. So I am very happy with the way it's going. And intelligent people agree with me.\nNo, I'm not. I am personally not.\nInvestigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/U.S. Economy/U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement\nWell, there's never been a President more transparent. The Mueller report came out: no obstruction, no collusion. No nothing. It's a beautiful report.\nThe Democrats cannot understand what happened. They really thought they had some people on their side, because, as you know, the people doing the investigation were 18 extremely angry Democrats, many of whom worked for Hillary Clinton and supported Hillary Clinton.\nAnd Bob Mueller, I guess you could say, he wasn't a friend of mine, but he did something that was really the right thing to do. They were very disappointed. They can't get over the fact that—never spoke to Russia, never dealt with Russia, having to do with the subject we're talking about.\nAnd I will say this: That without question, we have done a job like few Presidents have done. The only thing you can say about me, that some people may not like, is that I've created one of the greatest economies anywhere in the world. In fact, when I first met with, yesterday—with Prime Minister Abe, the first thing he did was congratulate me on the incredible economy that we have in the United States. So I think that we will work with them. We have a USMCA. We have a deal with Canada and Mexico that everybody wants, I think. It's all done. And I think they probably want to be doing that.\nAs you know, Ambassador Lighthizer is here, right now. That's a deal that's gotten universal praise. Unions love it. Farmers love it. Manufacturers love it. You won't have companies leaving and going to Mexico and going to Canada and going like they were for many, many years. It's a great deal. I would imagine that Nancy Pelosi will approve that. I would think it would be very hard not to, but we'll see.\nBut certainly, as things get approved I would love to sign them. It's only good for our country. I'm only interested in what's good for our country. It's very important. Thank you very much.\nI want to hear this answer too. [Laughter]\nThat's about four. [Laughter]\nI think probably that's enough.\nI think the—your compatriots will not be happy with another question. All right?\nThank you very much.\nI wanted to add, though, that—very importantly—I have nothing to do with TPP. Okay? Nothing to do. I'm not bound by anything that anybody else signs with respect to the United States. TPP would've destroyed our automobile industry and many of our manufacturers. We are not involved in TPP. So what other countries agreed to is not binding at all on the United States.\nAs far as China is concerned, they want to make a deal. I think they probably wish they made the deal that they had on the table before they tried to renegotiate it. They would like to make a deal. We're not ready to make a deal. And we're taking in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs, and that number could go up very, very substantially, very easily.\nBut I think, sometime in the future, China and the United States will absolutely have a great trade deal. And we look forward to that.\nOkay? Thank you.\nYes, sure, Jeff.\nJapan-U.S. Trade/China-U.S. Trade/U.S. Farmers\nFirst of all, getting to the G-20, I think that we are very much discussing different things with Japan. We have an unbelievably large imbalance—as you know, trade imbalance—which has been there for many, many years; Japan having the big advantage. They are brilliant businesspeople, brilliant negotiators, and put us in a very tough spot. But I think we will have a deal with Japan.\nLikewise, I think we will have a deal with China sometime into the future. Many companies are leaving China right now because of the tariffs. China is subsidizing a lot of industry because—you know, foolishly, some people said that the American taxpayer is paying the tariffs of China. No, no, no—it's not that way. They're paying a small percentage, but our country is taking in billions and billions of dollars.\nOur farmers—out of all of that money, the tens of billions of dollars—we're giving a relatively small percentage to our farmers, who have really been a focal point of what's gone on with trade. As you know, they've earmarked, and they've gone after the farmer, thinking that if they hurt the farmer, I'm going to negotiate a bad deal for the rest of the country.\nI'll tell you, the American farmer, these are patriots. These are great patriots. They don't want subsidy. We've had meetings—and I've had meetings with 32, 35, 40 farmers at one time, numerous times. And they don't want subsidy. I've told that to you before, Jeff. They want a level playing field. That's all they want, because they're better than anybody in the world.\nAnd they've told me. I said, \"You know, I'm going to get you subsidy while China takes advantage of us and China takes advantage of you, by pinpointing you.\" They say: \"We don't want subsidies, sir. All we want is a laying play—really, a level playing field.\"\nThe American farmer, these are great patriots. They are unbelievable people. And they're with me, a hundred percent. I believe that we will have a very good deal with China sometime into the future, because I don't believe that China can continue to pay these, really, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. I don't believe they can do that.\nYou know, businesses are leaving China by the hundreds, by the thousands, going into areas that are nontariffed, including the United States, by the way. But they're going to different parts of Asia: Vietnam; frankly, Japan. But they're going to a lot of places, but they're also coming to the United States, because people don't want to pay the tariff.\nAnd if you look, there is no tariff to pay. All you have to do is move your company to the United States. There is no 25-percent tariff.\nBut with all of that being said, I think that there's a very good chance that the United States and China will have a very good trade deal.\nWell, Kim Jong Un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record. I think I agree with him on that. But, at the same time, my people think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently. I view it as a man—perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn't matter.\nAll I know is that there have been no nuclear tests. There have been no ballistic missiles going out. There have been no long-range missiles going out. And I think that someday we'll have a deal. I'm not in a rush. Tremendous sanctions being put on the country of North Korea.\nAnd, again, Kim Jong Un understands the unbelievable economic potential that country has. It's located between Russia and China, on one side, and South Korea on the other. And it's all waterfront property. [Laughter] It's a great location, as we used to say in the real estate business. And I think he sees that.\nAnd I have to tell you—one other country—I really believe that Iran would like to make a deal. And I think that's very smart of them. And I think that's a possibility to happen also.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./Former President Barack Obama/Iran\nWell, when I look at what's been done by our Vice President and the President, when I look at the horrible Iran deal that they made, look what happened since I terminated the Iran deal. Look what has happened to Iran.\nIran, when I first came into office, was a terror. They were fighting in many locations all over the Middle East. They were behind every single major attack, whether it was Syria, whether it was Yemen, whether it was individual, smaller areas, whether it was taking away oil from people. They were involved with everything.\nNow they're pulling back, because they're got serious economic problems. We have massive—as you know, massive sanctions and other things. I mean, we just said the other day: steel, copper, different elements of what they used to sell. The oil is essentially dried up. And I'm not looking that—to hurt Iran at all. I'm looking to have Iran say, \"No nuclear weapons.\" We have enough problems in this world right now with nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons for Iran.\nAnd I think we'll make a deal. I think Iran—again, I think Iran has tremendous economic potential. And I look forward to letting them get back to the stage where they can show that. I think Iran—I know so many people from Iran. These are great people. It has a chance to be a great country, with the same leadership. We're not looking for regime change. I just want to make that clear. We're looking for no nuclear weapons.\nIf you look at the deal that Biden and President Obama signed, they would have access—free access—to nuclear weapons, where they wouldn't even be in violation, in just a very short period of time. What kind of a deal is that?\nSo we can't have that. Plus, there were many other things they did that were very bad. So I don't take sides as to who I'm in favor or who I'm not, but I can tell you that Joe Biden was a disaster. His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster when it came to so many things, whether it was economy, whether it was military, defense. No matter what it was, they had a lot problems. So I'm not a fan.\nThank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shinzo-abe-japan-tokyo-japan-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom in London, United Kingdom", "Date": "2019-06-04", "Text": "Thank you very much, Theresa.\nThank you very much, Theresa.\nWell, thank you, Prime Minister May. Melania and I are honored to return to London as our nations commemorate the 75th anniversary of D-day in World War II. We want to thank Her Majesty the Queen, who I had a lovely dinner with the last night—a fantastic person, fantastic woman—for so graciously inviting us to this state visit. It was very, very special.\nOur thanks as well to Prime Minister and Mr. May for the warm welcome they've given the First Lady and me, as we remember the heroes who laid down their lives to rescue civilization itself. On June 6, 1944, tens of thousands of young warriors left these shores by the sea and air to begin the invasion of Normandy and the liberation of Europe and the brutal Nazi occupation. It was a liberation like few people have seen before. Among them were more than 130,000 American and British brothers-in-arms. Through their valor and sacrifice, they secured our homelands and saved freedom for the world.\nTomorrow Prime Minister May and I will attend a commemoration ceremony in Portsmouth, one of the key embarkation points for the invasion. More than 1½ million American servicemembers were stationed right here in England in advance of the landings that summer. The bonds of friendship forged here and sealed in blood on those hallowed beaches will endure forever.\nOur special relationship is grounded in common history, values, customs, culture, language, and laws. Our people believe in freedom and independence as a sacred birthright and cherished inheritance worth defending at any cost. As the Prime Minister and I discussed in our meetings today and yesterday, the United States and the United Kingdom share many goals and priorities around the world.\nI want to thank the people of the United Kingdom for their service and partnership in our campaign to defeat ISIS. As we announced a few months ago, ISIS's territorial caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been completely obliterated—defeated.\nThe United Kingdom is also a key partner in NATO. The Prime Minister and I agree that our NATO allies must increase their defense spending. We've both been working very hard toward that end. And we are very current, and some of them are not. We can't allow that to happen. But I appreciate everything you've done in that regard.\nWe expect a growing number of nations to meet the minimum 2-percent-of-GDP requirement. To address today's challenges, all members of the alliance must fulfill their obligations. They have no choice. They must fulfill their obligation.\nAmong the pressing threats facing our nations is the development and spread of nuclear weapons. Perhaps that's our greatest threat. The United States and the United Kingdom are determined to ensure that Iran never develops nuclear weapons and stops supporting and engaging in terrorism. And I believe that will happen.\nIn protecting our nations, we also know that the border security is national security.\nToday the Prime Minister and I discussed our thriving economic relationship—both countries are doing very well—and participated in a roundtable with industry and business leaders, I can say, probably, the biggest business leaders anywhere in the world. Our nations have more than $1 trillion invested in each other's economics.\nThe United Kingdom is America's largest foreign investor and our largest European export market. That's a lot of importance. As the U.K. makes preparations to exit the European Union, the United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. There is tremendous potential in that trade deal, I say, probably, two and even three times of what we're doing right now. Tremendous potential.\nSeventy-five years ago this Thursday, courageous Americans and British patriots set out from this island toward history's most important battle. They stormed forward out of ships and airplanes, risking everything to defend our people and to ensure that the United States and Britain would forever remain sovereign and forever remain free.\nFollowing this press conference, Prime Minister May, Mr. May, the First Lady, my family, and I will visit the legendary Churchill War Rooms beneath the streets of London. I look forward to that. In his famous speech on this day in June 1940, Prime Minister Churchill urged his countrymen to \"defend our island, whatever the cost may be.\"\nAs we mark this solemn anniversary of D-day, we remember that the defense of our nations does not begin on the battlefield, but within the heart of every patriot. Today let us renew our pledge, engraved at the American Cemetery in Normandy and inscribed by President Dwight Eisenhower in St. Paul's Cathedral right here in London, that \"the cause for which they died shall live.\"\nPrime Minister May, it's been a true honor. I have greatly enjoyed working with you. You are a tremendous professional and a person that loves your country dearly. Thank you very much. Really an honor.\nThank you for the invitation to memorialize our fallen heroes and for your partnership in protecting and advancing the extraordinary alliance between the American and the British people. It's the greatest alliance the world has ever known. Thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you.\nThank you very much.\nYou're talking about the mayor of London. Is that who you said? Yes? Well, I think he's been a not very good mayor, from what I understand. He's done a poor job. Crime is up. A lot of problems. And I don't think he should be criticizing a representative of the United States that can do so much good for the United Kingdom.\nWe talked about it before: He should be positive, not negative. He's a negative force, not a positive force. And if you look at what he said, he hurts the people of this great country.\nAnd I think he should actually focus on his job. It'd be a lot better if he did that. He could straighten out some of the problems that he has and probably some of the problems that he's caused.\nThank you.\nJeremy—yes. Yes, he wanted to meet with me, and I told him no.\nYes.\nWell, I don't know Jeremy Corbyn. Never met him. Never spoke to him. He wanted to meet today or tomorrow, and I decided that I would not do that. I think that he is—from where I come from—somewhat of a negative force. I think that the people should look to do things correctly as opposed to criticize. I really don't like critics as much as I like and respect people that get things done. So I've decided not to meet.\nAs far as the protests, I have to tell you, because I commented on it yesterday: We left the Prime Minister, the Queen, the Royal Family; there were thousands of people on the streets cheering. And even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering. And then, I heard that there were protests. I said: \"Where are the protests? I don't see any protests.\" I did see a small protest today when I came, very small. So a lot of it is fake news, I hate to say. But you saw the people waving the American flag, waving your flag; it was tremendous spirit and love. There was great love. It was an alliance. And I didn't see the protesters until just a little while ago, and it was a very, very small group of people, put in for political reasons. So it was fake news. Thank you.\nIt's very big, and this really is a very big and important alliance. And I think people should act positively toward it, because it means so much for both countries. It means so much and it's been so good.\nSteve Holland [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], yes. Go ahead, Steve.\nWell, I don't like to take positions in things that I'm not, you know, really—I understand the issue very well. I really predicted what was going to happen. Some of you remember that prediction. It was a strong prediction, made at a certain location, on a development we were opening the day before it happened. And I thought it was going to happen because of immigration more than anything else, but probably, it happens for a lot of reasons.\nBut I would say, yes, I would think that it will happen and it probably should happen. This is a great, great country, and it wants its own identity. It wants to have its own borders. It wants to run its own affairs. This is a very, very special place. And I think it deserves a special place. And I thought maybe for that reason—and for others—but that reason, it was going to happen.\nYes, I think it will happen, and I believe the Prime Minister has brought it to a very good point where something will take place in the not-too-distant future. I think she's done a very good job. I believe it would be good for the country, yes.\nNo, because we're going to have absolutely an agreement on Huawei and everything else. We have an incredible intelligence relationship, and we will be able to work out any differences. I think we're not going to have it. We did discuss it. I see absolutely no limitations. We've never had limitations. This is a truly great ally and partner, and we'll have no problem with that. Okay?\nI think we're going to have a great trade deal, yes. I think we're going to have a great and very comprehensive trade deal——\nI can't hear him. What?\nLook, I think everything with a trade deal is on the table. When you're dealing in trade, everything is on the table, so NHS or anything else. There are a lot more than that. But everything will be on the table, absolutely. Okay.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nBorder Security/Mexico-U.S. Trade/Republican Party\nThat's good.\nNot \"possibly be.\"Q.Has Mexico done enough to avoid tariffs, which will be imposed in some 6 days from now? And——\nNo, we haven't started yet.\nYes, the threat is out there, but we haven't really started yet. No, this will take effect next week, the 5 percent.\nOh, I don't think they will do that. I think if they do, it's foolish. There's nothing more important than borders. I've had tremendous Republican support. I have a 90-percent—94-percent approval rating, as of this morning, in the Republican Party. That's an alltime record. Can you believe that? Isn't that something? I love records. [Laughter] But we have a 94-percent approval rating in the Republican Party.\nI want to see security at our border. I'm going to see great trade. I'm going to see a lot of things happening. And that is happening.\nAnd as you know, Mexico called. They want to meet. They're going to meet on Wednesday. Secretary Pompeo is going to be at the meeting, along with a few others that are very good at this. And we are going to see if we can do something.\nBut I think it's more likely that the tariffs go on. And we'll probably be talking during the time that the tariffs are on and they're going to be paid. And if they don't step up and give us security for our Nation—look, millions of people are flowing through Mexico. That's unacceptable. Millions and millions of people are coming right through Mexico. It's a 2,000-mile journey. And they're coming up to our border.\nAnd our Border Patrol, which is incredible, they're apprehending them, but our laws are bad, because the Democrats don't want to pass laws that could be passed in 15 minutes, that could be passed quickly. In 1 day, it could change.\nBut even beyond the laws, Mexico shouldn't allow millions of people to try and enter our country. And they could stop it very quickly, and I think they will. And if they won't, we're going to put tariffs on. And every month, those tariffs go from 5 percent, to 10 percent, to 15 percent, to 20, and then to 25 percent. And what will happen then is, all of those companies that have left our country and gone to Mexico are going to be coming back to us. And that's okay. That's okay.\nBut I think Mexico will step up and do what they should have been done. And I don't want to hear that Mexico is run by the cartels and the drug lords and the coyotes. I don't want to hear about that. A lot of people are saying that. Mexico has something to prove. But I don't want to hear that they're run by the cartels. You understand. You report on it all the time. A lot of people do. That would be a terrible thing.\nMexico should step up and stop this onslaught, this invasion into our country, John.\nYes. That's not such a—I would have sued, but that's okay. [Laughter] I would have sued and settled, maybe. But you never know. [Laughter] She's probably a better negotiator than I am, Jeremy.\nBut you know what? She has got it, in a sense, John. That deal is teed up. I think that deal is really teed up. I think they have to do something. And perhaps you won't be given the credit that you deserve if they do something, but I think you deserve a lot of credit. I really do. I think you deserve a lot of credit. Okay?\nYes, John.\nMember of Parliament Boris Johnson and Labour Party Leader Jeremy B. Corbyn of the United Kingdom\nSo I know Boris. I like him. I've liked him for a long time. He's—I think he'd do a very good job. I know Jeremy. I think he'd do a very good job. I don't know Michael. But would he do a good job—Jeremy? Tell me.

{"Title": "Interview with Joe Kernen of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"", "Date": "2019-06-10", "Text": "I am with you. Hi, Joe.\nWell, I guess he's not so brilliant. Look, without tariffs, we would be captive to every country, and we have been for many years. That's why we have an $800 billion trading deficit for years. We lose a fortune with virtually every country. They take advantage of us in every way possible, and the U.S. Chamber is right there with them, and I assume, and I'm a member of the U.S. Chamber -- maybe I'll have to rethink that, because when you look at it, the chamber is probably more for the companies and the people that are members than they are for our country. Because without tariffs, we would be absolutely, outside of something that I won't even mention, we would be absolutely in a competitive disadvantage, the likes of which you've never seen. Now, people haven't used tariffs, but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you're the piggy bank, when you have all the money. Everyone's trying to get our money, China -- and the China deal's going to work out you know why. Because of tariffs. Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don't want to pay the tariffs. And China will, in my opinion, based on a lot of facts and a lot of knowledge, China's going to make a deal because they're going to have to make a deal.\nWell, I'm going to tell you that most people understand that the people having to do with borders and illegal immigration and immigration of any kind, they understand exactly what that is. But we purposely said we wouldn't mention it for a little while. It's going to be brought up because it has to be brought by their legislative body. It's got to be taken to a vote. So we didn't bring it up, but most people know that answer, Joe. And it's another very powerful tool in addition to the very powerful tools we got. We had none of these tools – or virtually none, or they were just being talked about. They've been talked about for 20 years with Mexico, until I said -- and it wasn't a threat. I thought we would be receiving billions of dollars, frankly and you know what happens with tariffs, companies will move out of Mexico and they'll move out of china, and they'll come into the United States or other countries also. But in the case of Mexico, I say we'd get virtually 100% of the companies. They make a product and they sell it into our country. We lose a tremendous amount of money every year with Mexico for years, we've lost over $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico and of course, then we get into the second problem we have with Mexico, which maybe frankly is the first, and that's drugs and drugs coming across the border. So, we want to have very, very powerful borders, and you can't do it unless you have these deals with Mexico. And \"The New York Times\" wrote a story, like I already made the deal. It's nonsense. We talked about it for months and months and months, and they wouldn't get there, and we just said, hey, look, if you don't get there, we're just going to have to charge you hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and we would have been just fine, because what would have happened -- you know, all these babies, these – I don't know if they can honestly believe it -- you got it, Joe. I noticed you were just about 80% there. Not quite 100%, but you were 80% there. But what will happen is the companies will move into the United States, back where they came from. They took 30% of our automobile companies, of our carry companies. They moved into Mexico. All of the people got fired. They would all move back if they had to pay a 25% tax or tariff.\nThey would all move back. It's a very simple formula. Now, that would leave Mexico in an unbelievably bad position. We don't want that either. And I spoke with the President of Mexico. I get along with him very well, and we made this deal. But this is something the U.S. Has been trying to get for over 20 years with Mexico. They've never been able to do it. As soon as I put tariffs on the table, it was done. It took two days.\nHe's not protecting our country. He's doing a very big disservice and frankly, I've never had support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because they know where I stand on these things. I don't need money. I don't care how things are. The only thing I care about is our country. And he's protecting all of those companies that are members that like it just the way they are. And they have companies in Mexico and they have companies in China. I mean, if you look at what General Motors did, they moved so much into China. Well, they can't be happy about paying tariffs like we're charging, 25% for cars. General Motors was charging 45%. If you look at what was going on, they built -- they built massive car factories, automobile plants in China. So, what happened is China has a tariff for 45%. We have a tariff of basically zero. It's 2.5%, but basically it's zero. So, they sell us a car, it comes right into our country, no problem. We sell them a car, we have to pay 45%. It doesn't work that way, and it's not working that way anymore. And a lot of companies -- and I will say this -- companies and countries, but a lot of countries have changed their habits because they know they're next. Without the power of tariffs by the richest, most successful country -- you know, we've picked up trillions of dollars in worth since I've been elected. China has lost many, many trillions of dollars. They're way behind. They were going to catch us. Had a democrat gotten in, namely, the one we're talking about, China would have caught us by the end of her term. They're nowhere close. They'll never catch us. Not with what I'm doing. They'll never catch us.\nSure. I hear it all the time and I hear the other also. But I hear it all the time. And with Larry, in all fairness to Larry, they didn't let him finish his answer. He had further to go and nobody put that on. He put some of it on, but they didn't put it on the way that they should have. So, you know, that was a little bit of the media. Look, it depends on what country you're talking about. If you're talking about China, it's different than Mexico. China will subsidize their product because they want to keep people working. So, China is going to pay a lot. We have put 25% on $250 billion of Chinese goods coming into our country, including $50 billion of high-technology equipment and things. You haven't seen any, or virtually any price increase, because what China does – it's basically their companies – they subsidize their companies because they want to keep people working, they want to stay competitive. We have another $300 billion to go with China. I haven't done that because it's a very big thing for them, not for us. For us, it's not going to matter because we'll be able to buy the product in other countries that don't have the tariffs. So it's not going to have an effect. With Mexico, what's going to happen is all the companies would immediately move into the United States. You'd have car plants going up all over our country, and there would be no tariff. So from my standpoint, it's a no-brainer, and it's only the Chamber of Commerce who's representing many of these companies, like General Motors I'm sure is a member, and most of these companies that we would talk about, they'd be members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Well, General Motors does not want to see us put a 25% tariff on China, and now they send their cars in before – when they built those plants, there was no tariff. So they build a car in China and they send it into the United States. Same with Ford, same with others. Now with a 25% wall, those plants don't work anymore. They made a bad investment. So, they're going to say, \"Oh, Trump's a bad guy, he doesn't know what he's doing about tariffs.\" No, what's going to happen is they're going to have to come to the United States to build their plant. And the same with European Union at the right time, they're going to come in. They've been a very, very difficult negotiator. I would say maybe more difficult than China in certain ways and nobody understands that.\nA lot of it comes from Europe.\nTotally.\nAbsolutely. They devalue their currency. They have for years. It's put them at a tremendous competitive advantage and we don't have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn't lower interest rates. We have a Fed that raises interest rates the day before a bond issue goes out, so we have to pay more money. You tell me about that thinking, okay. We should be entitled to have a fair playing field, but even without a fair playing field – because our Fed is very, very destructive to us – even without a fair playing field, we're winning, because the tariffs are putting us at a tremendous competitive advantage –\nPeople want our goods – they want our money. We're the piggy bank. We're the bank.\nNo, they haven't listened to me. And you know, we have people – it's more than just Jay Powell. We have people on the Fed that really weren't, you know, they're not my people, but they certainly didn't listen to me because they made a big mistake. They raised interest rates far too fast. That's number one. Number two, they did quantitative tightening. They were taking in $50 billion a month, $50 billion a month and they've now eased that, but it's still $25 billion a month, which is ridiculous. Now, China's doing just the opposite. They're pumping money in. So, I'm not – I'm winning, but I'm not winning on a level table. If I had a table – don't forget, the head of the Fed in China is President Xi. He's the president of China. He also is the head of the Fed. He can do whatever he wants. They devalue, they loosen, or you would just say they pump a lot of money into China, and it nullifies to an extent, not fully – it nullifies the tariffs. But I will say this, they're also devaluing their currency to a point. Makes it better up to a point. It's very hard for them to buy oil. Oil becomes very expensive. They have to buy a lot of things outside of China. So, that's where the devaluation is bad for them. But it's good for them in terms of selling product and it's good for them in terms of sort of negating to a certain extent the tariffs. But with China, if we don't make a deal, you'll see a tariff increase of, you know, we have three – they do $100 billion with us. We're doing close to $600 billion with them. So, we have the big, big advantage. Plus, we're the one that everybody is so used to taking advantage of as a country because we had, frankly, presidents that either didn't understand it or they were bored by it or they weren't smart enough to get what's going on. But those days are over, and we're doing great as a country. We're doing – but I just want to say to the United States Chamber of Commerce, if we didn't have tariffs, we wouldn't have made a deal with Mexico. We got everything we wanted. And we're going to be a great partner to Mexico now because now they respect us. They didn't even respect us. They couldn't believe how stupid we were with what's going on, where somebody comes in from Mexico and just walks right into our country and we're powerless to do anything. Whereas they had very strong immigration laws. They don't have to take anybody. They can say, out, you get. So, we're going to be essentially using to a large extent the very powerful immigration laws of Mexico. And Mexico wants to do a good job. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. Do you think they agreed to do that before? And they're paying them. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border. That means the people from Guatemala, the people from Honduras and El Salvador, in theory, if they do it right, they're not going to be able to get through. Nobody's going to be able to get through. And then they're also going to protect our southern border. So, it should have a big impact. Now, with all of that being said, the Democrats refuse to do anything on illegal immigration. They want open borders and they don't mind crime, they don't mind human trafficking, they don't mind drugs. You tell me if that's a good campaign issue, because i think they get clobbered on that issue.\nHi, Beck. I know Becky for a long time. Hi, Becky.\nYes, it would. And I think he will go and I think we are scheduled to have a meeting. I think he'll go. I have a great relationship with him. He's actually an incredible guy, a great man. He's very strong and very smart but he's for China and I am for the United States. It's a very simple – it is a simple stat. He's for China, I am for the U.S., so we are going to have our differences. But I think the differences can be worked out very easily. I would be surprised if he didn't go. I think he is going, I haven't heard that he's not. We are expected to meet. If we do, that's fine and if we don't, that's fine. Look, from our standpoint, the best deal we can have is 25% on $600 billion, okay? And then those companies are going to move into other locations and they are going to send – and there won't be a tariff. You know, our business people in this country are very sophisticated. They are very good. If a product goes up in price, they go to Vietnam or they go to one of many other countries or they make the product in the United States, which is my favorite. But that's what will happen. No, if we don't have a deal – if we don't make a deal, then we will be raising the tariffs, meaning putting the tariffs on more than – you know, we've only taxed 35% to 40% of what they send in. They have another 60% and that'll be taxed absolutely.\nWell, I can tell you they discriminate against me. You know, people talk about collusion. The real conclusion is between the Democrats and these companies. Because they were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, ‘If you don't have them, you can't win.' Well, I won, you know, and I'll win again because we are doing well. We are not fools anymore. We are not the foolish country that does so badly. You look at India, a very good friend of mine, Prime Minister Modi, you take a look at what they have done, 100% tax on a motorcycle. We charge them nothing. So, when Harley sends it over there, they have 100% tax. When they send it, they make a tremendous number of motorcycles. When they send them, no tax. I called him. I said it's unacceptable. He reduced it by 50% with one phone call. I said it's still unacceptable because it is 50% verses nothing. It's still unacceptable. And they're working on it. But if I didn't -- if we did not have the power of what we have, and if we weren't the bank – well, if we weren't the bank, we wouldn't even be talking about it because nobody would care. But we're the bank that everybody wants to rob. And that's what they've been doing for a long period of time. $800 billion we have in trade deficits with other countries. So, you tell me who made those deals.\nWell, I am the one – I'm a budget cutter and I have cut the budget. But on defense, I don't want to do any cutting. Because President Obama, and President Bush – you know, he was fighting the wars in the Middle East-- I was left a very depleted military. And I feel just the opposite. I am very much of a cost cutter. I want to have a great budget. But before a budget, I have to have a great military. So, as long as I am here, we are going to have a great military and they're not going to have to worry. We've rebuilt, we've ordered many F-35s, we've ordered ships and planes and missiles and we are ordering the best stuff in the world. Plus, I am a sales man for the country. I'm getting other country to buy tremendous amount of our military. You know, you could ask any of the folks run our military companies--the different companies what they are doing because of me. I get nothing. I'm sitting there in the oval office, saying, ‘You've got to buy our helicopters. If you don't, we are not going to be happy with you,' and they end up going out to buy our helicopters and our F-35s. Look at how many F-35s Japan and other companies are buying. So, you know, it's good as long as I'm there. I am a little concerned about United Technologies and Raytheon because one of the things that I bring up all of the time, we used to have many plane companies. We used to have many, many. They've all merged. Now we have very few. We have the two main ones, as you know, and you have Lockheed and Boeing and you have a little bit some others, just a little bit. But they're all merged in, so it is hard to negotiate when you have two companies and sometimes you get one bid. When we had 10 and 12 companies, now that may not be sustainable because they all go bust. And so, that's the purpose of what they did. But never the less, I can tell you because I get involved in negotiations. I got the plane cost down a lot. So, when I hear United Technologies, which is a great company, I know it well because I bought many an Otis Elevator over my lifetime. It is a great company but when I hear United, and I bought a lot of carrier too, by the way—when I hear United and when I hear Raytheon, which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible, when I hear they're merging, does that take away more competition? It becomes one big fat, beautiful company. But I have to negotiate. Meaning the United States has to buy things and does that make it less competitive? Because it is already so very less – it's already not competitive. You look at the budgets of other major countries: take a look at Russia, they spend $68 billion a year on military. Take a look at China, they're $200-$250 billion a year. Well, we are many times that. And part of it because we spend so much money and part of it is we have no competition. We really don't. We don't have competition.\nWell, there's something going on, Joe. And I will tell you this: the European Union, which is a fantastic group of negotiators, actually a very, very prominent person who you know well, who's on your show a lot, said the person at the European Union that's in charge of taxation hates the United States more than any person anywhere in the world. And I really believe that's true. Every week you see them going after Facebook and Apple and all of these companies, that are, you know, great companies but something is going on. But I will say the European Union is suing them all the time. We are going to be looking at them differently. We have a great Attorney General, we are going to look at it differently. When they give European Union $7 billion and $5 billion and $2 billion, and you know, Apple gets sued for $10 billion. And you know, right now, it is going on but they'll end up settling. They get all this money. We should be doing that – they're our companies, so they're actually attacking our companies. But we should be doing what they're doing. They think there is a monopoly. But I am not sure if they think that. They just figure this is easy money, we'll sue Apple for $7 billion and we'll make a settlement or we'll win the case. So, I think it is a bad situation. But, obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.\nWell, only if they have the same products. They have some overlap, from what I understand. But only if they have the same products. That would be the thing that bothers me most. I mean, I can tell you from the airplanes, you want to buy a plane and you will have one bid. You don't have the people that make them. The companies that make them are incredible. They make them incredibly and they are great companies. But you don't have any competition. It is crazy. We have given up making like the F-22 fighter jets and that was a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing. It was the greatest fighter jet, in my opinion, it was the greatest ever. And we gave it up because it was costing so much. You have the two companies in a joint venture, and from what I hear, I wasn't here then, that was a while ago, but from what I hear, you could not negotiate with them. This is what we want them, and the government says we'll take it. Okay. So, I just want to see competition, the two great companies, I love them both. But I want to see that we don't hurt our competition.\nWell, I do see it as a threat. At the same time, it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiations with China. China very much wants to make a deal. They want to make a deal much more than I do. But we'll see what happens. Look, I don't mind taking in billion of dollars. You know, the 3.2 we had in the first quarter, a lot of people said we picked up one point because of all the tariffs that we are taking in from China. Just remember, they're charging us tariffs. You know, some of the folks that I really like but some of the senators come to me, ‘Well sir, it's not really good because it is not free market.' Like, you take India where they are charging 100%-- and by the way 100% is nothing compares to what some companies charge. You know, France charges us a lot for the wine and yet we charge them little for French wine. So the wineries come to me and they say—the California guys, they come to me: Sir, we are paying a lot of money to put our products into France and you're letting – meaning, this country is allowing this French wine which is great, we have great wine, too, allowing it to come in for nothing. It is not fair. And you know what, it's not fair. We'll do something about it.\nI made a priority for 5G, before I got here, we were way behind. Now we are actually going to be leading very shortly. We are leading in everything. We are-- if you look at China, China, as great as they are and they are great, they are near the capability of our geniuses in Silicon Valley that walk around in under shirts and they were not $2 billion a piece. Okay. They don't have nearly the genius these people have. And they practically admit it. They don't want to exactly and say that. They try to go out and buy the company. Now we have restrictions on that, too, which we put in under my administration very recently. Because they were buying all of our companies. They could not do it. But we have the most brilliant people. We have the most brilliant. Huawei is very powerful and very strong, don't forget ZTE, I did something with them where I closed them up and they paid me – they paid us as a country, $1.2 billion fee and we changed their board, changed their management, we allowed them to open, but ZTE is a much smaller – that was $1.2 billion done in one week. That was you know a good deal. And you know I don't want to put their companies out of business. I want China to do well. I don't want them to do as well as us, I have to be honest with you. You know when they say China, 25 years, you don't see them anymore. It says China 25. And what they mean is that in 25 they're going to be much bigger and they're going to be dominant in 25. I told President Xi, listen, that's very insulting to me. Can't do that. They took it off – they don't use China 25 anymore because he understood exactly what we meant. Look, I said it before, we picked up $10 trillion more than that in value. And they've lost $15 to $20 trillion in value since the day I was elected. We are doing great. I hope the Raytheon deal – I hope it can happen. But I don't want to see where we have one less person that can compete for an order. I don't want to see that. It's no good. And as far as the U.S. Chambers of Commerce, they have to start representing the United States and not just the companies that are members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nThank you Joe. And thank you Becky. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-joe-kernen-cnbcs-squawk-box"}

Look who's in the back of the car! Him, right here.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): Starting in Iowa on Tuesday where we rode together in his brand new armored limo, The Beast.\nOh, this is amazing actually.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): The conversation turned tense after Trump raised the Mueller report, himself.\nSafety, security, great economy. I think I've done more than any other first-term president ever. I have a phony witch hunt, which is just a phony pile of stuff. Mueller comes out. There's no collusion. And essentially a ruling that no obstruction. And they keep going with it. You know what? People are angry about it.\nThat is what they found. Excuse me. He found no collusion. And they didn't find anything having to do with obstruction because they made a ruling based on his findings and they said no obstruction.\nOh, are you trying to say now that there was collusion even though he said there was no collusion?\nHe said no collusion.\nGeorge, the report said no collusion.\nUh, yes I did, and you should read it, too.\nAlright, let's go. You should read it, too, George.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): Back at the White House Wednesday, we were invited into the Oval Office where the president returned to the Mueller report -- again unprompted -- this time responding to a question about 2020 polling he doesn't like.\nBecause it's untrue. I like the truth. You know, I'm actually a very honest guy. If I thought they were correct, I wouldn't be complaining at all. I understand that. It's like the witch hunt that goes on. No collusion with Russia, there was no collusion. And what bothers me --\nYou know can I -- it's what it says. It said no collusion.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): In fact, the report cites 126 contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, but insufficient evidence to charge a criminal conspiracy.\nNo George, all I want is the truth. All I want is fairness.\nExcuse me, excuse me. Pursuing, what does pursuing mean? You know, because someone walks in, says, \"Hey we're looking at --\" Do you know that I don't even think they had a site? I don't even think they knew who was gonna do the deal. It was a concept of a deal, more of a concept than anything else. It was a concept of a deal someplace in Russia, probably in Moscow, and I was lookin' at places all over the world --\nI wouldn't mind telling ‘em. There's nothing wrong with it. In fact, I -- I didn't consider that pursuing a deal when you don't even have a site.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): Then that stunning admission about the prospect of accepting help from a foreign power in 2020.\nI think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't -- there's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, \"We have information on your opponent.\" Oh, I think I'd want to hear it.\nIt's not an interference. They have information. I think I'd take it. If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI. If I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, that they come up with oppo research. \"Oh, let's call the FBI.\" The FBI doesn't have enough agents to take care of it, but you go and talk honestly to congressmen, they all do it, they always have. And that's the way it is. It's called oppo research.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): Later that day, I asked him about Mueller's findings on obstruction of justice, and a statement signed by more than a thousand former prosecutors who believe Trump was spared from indictment only because of a Justice Department opinion that a sitting president cannot face criminal charges.\nOh, that's -- but they're all politicians.\nI could get you thousands. You know how many prosecutors there have been over the -- if you add 'em all up? We could get you thousands of prosecutors. I've been treated so unfairly 'cause I never did anything. There was no crime.\nOh, give me a break. She's running for president. She's doing horribly. She's way down in the polls.\nAnd I must say Pocahontas is really cleaning her clock. And I heard she made that statement. And you know what? Who wouldn't? Probably if I were running in her position, I'd make the same statement.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): I asked Trump about some of the specific evidence of possible obstruction Mueller cited in his report.\nYeah, yeah.\nOK now, the story on that very simply, number one, I was never gonna fire Mueller. I never suggested firing Mueller. Do I think--\nExcuse -- I don't care what he says. It doesn't matter. That was to show everyone what a good counsel he was. Now, he may have gotten confused with the fact that I've always said, and I've said it to you, and I've said to anybody that would listen, Robert Mueller was conflicted.\nBecause he wanted to make himself look like a good lawyer. Or -- or he believed it because I would constantly tell anybody that would listen, including you, including the media, that Robert Mueller was conflicted. Robert Mueller had a total conflict of interest.\nI never said -- I didn't say that. If I -- look, Article II. I would be allowed to fire Robert Mueller. There was -- assuming -- assuming I did all of the things, I said I want to fire him, number one, I didn't. He wasn't fired. Okay? Number one, very importantly. But more importantly, Article II allows me to do whatever I want. Article II would have allowed me to fire him.\nBut I wasn't gonna fire. You know why? Because I watched Richard Nixon go around firing everybody, and that didn't work out too well. So very simply, Article II would allow me to do it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): Article II of the Constitution outlines the powers of the presidency, and the president's defenders argue he cannot commit obstruction of justice while exercising those powers.\nThat is the position of a lot of great lawyers. That's the position of some of the most talented lawyers. And you have to have a position like that because you're the president. But without even bringing up Article II, which absolutely gives you every right --\nA president can run the country. And that's what happened, George. I run the country, and I run it well.\nI'm just saying a president under Article II -- it's very strong. Read it. Do you have Article II? Read it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): The president never sat for an interview under oath with the special counsel's team. Instead he answered written questions about contacts with Russia, but he refused to answer any questions about obstruction of justice.\nBecause they were looking to get us for lies, for slight misstatements. I looked at what happened to people, and it was very unfair. Very, very unfair. Very unfair.\nI did nothing wrong, George. Did nothing wrong. There was no collusion. You don't even hear Russia mentioned anymore. Russ -- Russia's not mentioned. Now, it's all about obstruct -- obstruction of what? They built up a phony crime. They hired a man that hated Trump. He hired 18 people that were Democrats that hated Trump. Some of them contributed to Clinton's campaign.\nA couple of 'em worked for Clinton. I mean, what kind of a rigged deal is this? And then on top of it, after two years and after being the most transparent in history -- I gave them 1.5 million pages of documents, right? I gave them four or five hundred witnesses. I let Don McGahn testify. I let him say -- he was the White House counsel. I let him test -- I knew he was gonna testify.\nNow, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I did answer questions. I answered them in writing.\nI don't know about those -- I don't know. I answered a lotta questions. They gave me questions. I answered them in writing.\nLook, George, you're being a little wise guy, okay, which is, you know, typical for you. Just so you understand. Very simple. It's very simple. There was no crime. There was no collusion. The big thing's collusion. Now, there's no collusion. That means they set -- it was a setup. In my opinion, and I think it's gonna come out.\nI hope it's gonna come out. We are going to find out very soon. Because I really believe it's gonna come out. When you look at Strzok, these FBI guys that were lowlifes, when you look -- 'cause the FBI's the greatest. But these -- the top people were absolutely lowlifes. When you look at Strzok and Page and they're talking about an insurance policy just in case she loses, that was the insurance policy.\nI really believe it's gonna come out. When you look at Strzok --\nYou'd have to ask them. Oh, they tried. They tried. And you know what? Had that gone out before the election, I -- I don't think I could've -- I don't think I would've had enough time to defend myself --\nI would say that he certainly must have known about it because it went very high up in the chain. But you're gonna find that out. I'm not gonna make that statement quite yet. But I would say that President Obama had to know about it.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS (VO): And of course our conversation took place against the backdrop of growing calls from Democrats eager to open an impeachment inquiry.\nLook. The Republicans in the Senate, every single one of 'em that I see know this is a witch hunt. They get it a hundred percent. And that's what matters. The Democrats are gonna do it only because they might think it helps them. I think it actually hurts 'em in the election. But there's never been a time in the history of our country where somebody was so mistreated as I have been. And this should never, ever be allowed to happen to another president again. A previous administration used the intelligence data and the intelligence agencies to spy on my campaign.\nI don't know. But hopefully we're gonna find out.\nAnd, of course, you have to look at it, because if you don't look at it you're not going to know if it's bad. How are you going to know if it's bad? But of course you give it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-george-stephanopoulos-abc-news-3"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland", "Date": "2019-06-12", "Text": "Thank you very much. Please. Today Melania and I are honored to welcome President Duda and Mrs. Kornhauser-Duda of Poland back to the White House. They've become friends. We last hosted them in Washington, in September, and it's wonderful to see you both again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great honor.\nSince our last meeting, the unbreakable bonds between the United States and Poland have grown even closer. This year, as our nations mark 100 years of diplomatic relations, the U.S.-Polish alliance is stronger, by far, than ever before.\nEarlier today President Duda and I signed a joint declaration affirming the significant defense cooperation between our nations. And, as the declaration makes very clear, the United States and Poland are not only bound by a strategic partnership, but by deep, common values, shared goals, and a very strong and abiding friendship.\nOur people are united by the enduring ties of civilization, culture, and history. We respect the rule of law, revere individual rights, and prize our timeless traditions. We embrace country, faith, family, and freedom.\nOver the past century, brave American and Polish patriots have repeatedly stood together to defend our sovereignty, our liberty, and our noble way of life. When I was last in Poland, I was very proud to stand among veterans of the Warsaw Uprising and recall their incredible courage in the face of Nazi tyranny. Today we honor the sacrifices of all those who came before by doing our part to safeguard our independence and strengthen the incredible U.S.-Polish alliance.\nAs stated in the joint declaration, the United States and Poland continue to enhance our security cooperation. Poland will still provide basing and infrastructure to support military presence of about 1,000 American troops. The Polish Government will build these projects at no cost to the United States. The Polish Government will pay for this. We thank President Duda and the people of Poland for their partnership in advancing our common security.\nPoland's burden sharing also extends to the NATO alliance, where it is among 8 NATO allies, including the United States, currently meeting the minimum 2 percent of GDP that's for defense spending. And Poland is there. And you've been there from a very early date, and we appreciate that very much. And we've been there also. There's been a total of 8—8 out of 28, and the rest are coming along. Because nations, at my urging, have paid more than $100 billion more toward the NATO defense.\nLast month, I was very pleased that Poland announced the intent to purchase 32 American-made F-35 fighter aircraft, like you just saw. Moments ago, we witnessed that impressive flyover of this cutting-edge F-35 as it flew over the White House and actually came to a—pretty close to a halt over the White House. I was saying, \"What's wrong with that plane? It's not going very fast.\" [Laughter] But it's an incredible—it's an incredible thing when you can do that. That plane can land dead straight, and it's one of the few in the world that can do that. Considered to be the greatest fighter jet in the world.\nI applaud President Duda for its efforts to strengthen and modernize Poland's defenses. I also want to congratulate Poland for its progress on meeting U.S. criteria for entry into the Visa Waiver Program. Today our country signed a Preventing and Combating Serious Crimes agreement, a significant and necessary step for Poland's entry into the program. Though we still have some work to do, we hope to welcome Poland into the Visa Waiver Program very soon, and that's a very big deal.\nBoth of our nations understand that immigration security is national security. In our meeting, President Duda and I discussed the vital issue of energy. Reliance on a single foreign supplier of energy leaves nations totally vulnerable to coercion and extortion. For this reason, we support Poland's construction of the Baltic pipeline, which will help European countries diversify their energy sources. It's desperately needed, and that's the way to go.\nDuring the past year, Poland has also signed approximately 25 billion dollars' worth of new contracts with U.S. firms to buy more than 6 billion cubic meters of U.S. liquefied natural gas. Today our nations just signed another contract for an additional 2 billion cubic meters worth approximately $8 billion.\nSo between the planes and the liquefied natural gas and many other things that Poland is doing—which is doing very well because Poland is doing very, very well—we appreciate it. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\nOur countries also signed an agreement to expand U.S.-Polish civil nuclear cooperation, which will likewise advance Poland's energy and security and deepen our bilateral commercial ties.\nEconomic relations between the U.S. and Poland are thriving. We're committed to further expanding commerce based on fairness and reciprocity, perhaps my favorite word.\nAcross many critical areas—from defense and diplomacy, to energy and economics—the alliance between the United States and Poland is reaching extraordinary new heights in 2019. Our longstanding partnership demonstrates the enormous possibilities for the world when two strong and independent nations unite in common purpose and in common cause.\nPresident Duda, it's a honor to have you with us. And, Mrs. Duda, thank you very much for being here. We usher in a very exciting new era in U.S.-Polish alliance. It's a very special alliance with very special people. We build a future of promise and prosperity for the American and the Polish people. And, again, our relationship is an extraordinary one, and it's going to remain that for a long, long time.\nThank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you.\nThank you. Thank you very much. We'll take a few questions. Emerald [Emerald Robinson, One America News Network], OAN.\nThank you.\nRussia-Germany Nord Stream II Natural Gas Pipeline/Poland-U.S. Relations\nNo, I don't think so. I just will tell you very strongly that I think Germany is making a tremendous mistake by relying so heavily on the pipeline. And I think it's a tremendous mistake for Germany. But again, Germany is running their affairs. And they'll do just fine.\nBut I was critical. I had been critical of it. It's a tremendous amount of their energy will be supplied by that pipeline.\nAt the same time, having nothing to do with Germany, Poland said that we would like to build a facility, a great facility, and we'd like to have you come to that facility. So we're going to be there with a limited force, but we'll be there. And we appreciate Poland doing what they're doing. It's a great location. It's a tremendous—it's a tremendous plant, tremendous facility. And we—it's our honor to be there.\nPoland has been a tremendous friend of ours for a long time. And when Melania and I were there not so long ago, it was a very special day. I think it was a special day for Poland, also. But it was a very special day for our country. So I appreciate that. And our relationship is just a very strong one.\nYes, go ahead.\nHe just wrote me a very nice letter, unexpected. And someday, you'll see what was in that letter. Someday, you'll be reading about it. Maybe in 100 years from now, maybe in 2 weeks. Who knows? But it was a very nice letter. It was a very warm, very nice letter. I appreciated it. Okay?\nGood. Thank you very much.\nPlease.\nPoland-U.S. Military Cooperation\nHe'd like to see 250,000 troops. [Laughter] We'll keep it slightly below the—[inaudible].\nI just have a very warm feeling for Poland. I always have. And it's now even beyond that because of the relationship, which we've developed with your President and First Lady. And it's just—they're very—they're incredible people: hard-working, smart, very industrious people. And what they've done with the country over the last 5 years has been something that the world has watched and the world has marveled at.\nI've just liked Poland. So when the President came and he asked me whether or not we'd consider this, I said, \"I will consider it.\" And now, because of his leadership, we're able to do that. And that's fine with me. That's great. Great people. And say \"hello.\"\nWe are looking very seriously at going back to Poland. And I don't know what the President has in store for us, but we're thinking about going back sometime in September. Yes. Thank you.\nThank you.\nLet's see, who do I like? [Laughter] Nobody. That's the end. [Laughter]\nGo ahead. Yes.\nI was pointing at you, but you can go ahead. Here we go.\nI was actually pointing to my friend with that beautiful hat on, but that's okay.\nYou'll give up your question?\nHuh? Okay. We'll share it. Good.\nNo, it's not what I meant. It's what I said. And that's—I think it's different than maybe your interpretation. I think we're going to do very well with North Korea over a period of time. I'm in no rush. The sanctions are on. We got our hostages back. Our remains are coming back; you saw the beautiful ceremony in Hawaii with Mike Pence. We're getting the remains back. There's been no nuclear testing whatsoever. They'd like to do something. I did get, you know, a very—as I said yesterday, a very nice letter from Chairman Kim. And I think we're doing very well.\nWhen I took over as President, I will tell you, it looked like it was going to be war with North Korea. You know that. Everybody knows that. And it was going to be quite brutal. A strong force. We're the strongest force in the world, but that's a strong force.\nAnd we started off a very rough relationship, and I think we have a very good relationship right now. So we'll see what happens. I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush.\nBut there's been no nuclear testing whatsoever. And when I took over, it was nuclear testing all the time. And if you look back to the last 4, 5, 6 years—but really go back further than that. In all fairness to President Obama, go back 20 years, 15 years. It was, really, a very dangerous situation. I consider it to be different now.\nNow, I may change. And if I change, you will know it very quickly. I will be very quick to tell you exactly what's going on. I may change. But right now we have a good relationship, and I think, probably, better than we've had for maybe 25 years, maybe forever. You know, they've been there a long time—the grandfather, the father, the son. And they've been there for a long time, and nobody has done anything except me. And so we'll see how it all turns out. I hope it turns out well for you and for everybody.\nPoland-Russia Relations/China-U.S. Trade\nAre you talking to me?\nBoy, was that a setup question. [Laughter]\nAnd just to finish, I hope that Poland is going to have a great relationship with Russia. I think it's possible. I really do. I think because of what you've done and the strength—and maybe we help also, because of what we're doing and doing for Poland.\nBut I hope that Poland is going to have a great relationship with Russia. I hope we're going to have a great relationship with Russia and, by the way, China and many other countries. And we look forward to doing things on North Korea, just to go back to the original part of your question. And we'll see how that works out.\nI do want to say, though: We're in no hurry. The sanctions are on. China has actually been helping us quite a bit. And despite our trade differences right now—we thought we had a deal, and unfortunately, they decided that they were going to change the deal, and they can't do that with me. But something is going to happen, and I think it's going to be something very positive.\nBut we think we're going to get along with a lot of countries that, frankly, did not respect us very much because they were ripping us off for many, many years. And they're not ripping us off anymore.\nWell, we're going to be meeting—President Xi and myself—and you know we have a very good relationship. But, again, he's for China, and I'm for the U.S. It's a big difference. And we thought we had a deal. We didn't have a deal. And I would never make something that would be less than what we already had.\nWe had China opened up to trade. That's a big thing. They've never done that before. We had intellectual property theft taken care of and taken care of beautifully. And all of the sudden, those things started to disappear at the end, after they were fully negotiated.\nBut that's—you know, that's their decision. I think if they had to do again—and in light of the fact that we have 25 percent on $250 billion of goods coming into the United States. And unlike a lot of countries, they subsidize those goods. We haven't had inflation. And you know, they keep saying that the American taxpayer is paying for it. No. No. Very little.\nAnd what it really does mean is that a lot of those companies that are in China are going to be moving back to the U.S. You have car companies—General Motors, as an example—that built plants in China. Well, that doesn't work out too well when you have the tariff wall up because now they're going to have to get through that and they can't really get through that. So maybe they'll start building plants in the United States instead.\nI think that we'll end up making a deal with China. We have a very good relationship, although it's a little bit testy right now, as you would expect. I think they really have to make a deal. A lot of companies are leaving China, as you know. It's in all the reports. And they're going to Vietnam and various other places, and they're also coming to the United States to make their product because they don't want to pay the tariff.\nAnd there is no tariff if you do it in the United States. People don't realize that. You know, they say \"the tariff,\" but there is no tariff if you don't do it—you know, if you just do exactly as I say: You bring your company back to the United States.\nAnd as far as Mexico is concerned, which was a very big topic yesterday—and now people are finding out that the reports that were written were totally false—we would never have had a deal with Mexico without imposing tariffs. Once the tariffs were imposed—and they've been trying to make this deal with Mexico for 20 years, 25 years. The older reporters, those great reporters with the very gray hair in the back—you know who I'm talking about; they know exactly what I'm talking about—you would have never made the deal with Mexico.\nWe have a great deal with Mexico. I actually think we have a much better relationship right now with Mexico because they respect us again. But you would never have had that deal if I didn't impose the tariffs. And those tariffs were ready to go to on Monday morning, and we made the deal on, essentially, Sunday night.\nAnd that extra little page of the deal that you saw that brilliantly—I had gained such respect for you people when I held it up to the sunlight and it was closed, and you were able to read it through the sunlight. That was not anticipated. But regardless, I mean, you knew enough of what it said. And I didn't do it on purpose, but we have a lot of strength in 45 days if we decide to use that strength. Maybe we will, and maybe we won't. But there's a lot of power right now in the border.\nAnd I will say this: Mexico is, right now, doing more for the United States on illegal immigration and all of the problems of crime and other problems on the border than the Democrats. We can solve our problem on the border in 15 minutes if the Democrats would sit down, straighten out asylum—which is a total mess, but very uncomplicated—straighten out asylum, and get rid of the loopholes. It would take, Jeff, 15 minutes.\nOkay? Thank you. Please.\nChina-U.S. Trade\nNo, I have no deadline. My deadline is what's up here. We'll figure out the deadline.\nNobody can quite figure it out.\nNo.\nWe think fairly soon. We're doing very well with it. It's a complex situation, as you know. But we're getting very close. We allow very few countries to join, but Poland is one that we're thinking about allowing in. So we'll be making that decision over the next, probably, 90 days.\nI think it's a very good idea. Thank you very much for giving me that idea. [Laughter]\nOkay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-andrzej-duda-poland-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with TIME Magazine", "Date": "2019-06-20", "Text": "Yeah, I think they'd be making a big mistake doing that.\nI wouldn't say that. I can't say that at all. It would be inappropriate. But they would be making a big mistake if they enriched.\nTime will tell. Only time will tell.\nThat's true. Well I have. We defeated ISIS, the caliphate. We've taken back the caliphate. That doesn't mean one of the crazies doesn't walk into a store all bombed up. But we've taken back 100%. I wish I could show you the maps of what it was before and what it was after. Sarah, maybe you could ask somebody to bring me those maps. The — ISIS, when I got there, and ISIS when I left. Right now, there is no ISIS. ISIS has — the entire caliphate is down. Remember when it was 99% gone and I started moving people out. They said \"He didn't finish the job.\" Anyway, so —\nWell — look — I also said Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon, you know, which is very important. As you know in Afghanistan, when I got there, it was 16,000 people. It's now 9,000 people. And some good things are happening there frankly. No, I'd like to get out of the Middle East, we should have never been in the Middle East. We should have never been there, and I'd like to get out.\nWell, one of the things that seems to be rather ridiculous — also, Shea, do me a favor. Will you get the information I had yesterday — the people that benefit from the Straits. The companies, countries that benefit from the Straits. Just — I want to show you something. China gets 60% of their oil there. Japan 25% of their oil. So many of the other places get such vast amounts of oil there. We get very little. You know, we have made tremendous progress in the last 2-1/2 years in energy, and when the pipelines get built, we're now an exporter of energy. So we're not in the position that we were in, that we used to be in in the Middle East where we needed — you know we were there — some people would say we were there for the oil.\nWell, I wouldn't even want to say that, but I would certainly go over nuclear weapons, and I would keep the other a question mark. Shea? Ask them to bring in the documents I saw yesterday.\n[to an aide] I'm talking about through the Straits. The oil that comes in by country. I had it yesterday. Who would have it? Maybe Bolton would have it, or somebody\nWhich is a pretty shocking thing. You look at China, it's a big beneficiary — they don't pay anything. Japan is a big beneficiary, they don't pay anything. Many other countries, they don't pay anything. Indonesia. Many other countries come, they don't pay anything. And we're there keeping the world as, you know, we're there keeping the oil flowing. Right? And the amazing thing is we're now an exporter, so in theory, we're a beneficiary of oil problems. But I don't view it that way.\nWell, I don't think too many people don't believe it. I think people say they don't believe it because they don't want to get drawn in. But they don't, they don't, uh, they don't believe it.\nWell, we're just starting that process, but other countries are a bigger beneficiary of that part of the world now than we are. Far bigger.\nNo, I don't think we have any problems. I have a good group of people now. I have people that I want. And we have some terrific people, and no, that's not a problem. But what is a problem is that the United States takes care of the world, and the world doesn't take care of the world. The world doesn't want to take care of itself. There are some countries, as an example that benefit greatly, and they're rich countries. These are very rich countries in some cases, and they don't make contributions, and they haven't for many, many years. And at some point — you know, look, I've done a lot about that. If you look at NATO, if you call up Secretary General Stoltenberg, you'll see that, he said over $100 billion has been contributed over the last very short period of time by other countries who were not living up to their 2% commitment and the 2% should be more than 2%, by the way. And over $100 billion has been paid, and if you look at a chart of NATO, it's gone, go back 15 years, it's gone literally, the contribution, down here, and then it went up like this when I became — And I told them, I said, ‘Look, the United States cannot continue to be—' I mean, they're not paying. They're literally not paying. We're protecting nations, and they're not paying, and it was very unfair. But Secretary General Stoltenberg was terrific. He tells it like it is. Big difference.\nNo. Europe looks at me as a double — I guess first of all, my relationships with Europe are very good. You saw that with my recent trip to — number of trips, frankly — but my recent trip with France, where Normandy was a tremendous and beautiful thing to behold. It really was incredible. But I have very good relationships in Europe. The Prime Minister of U.K., the Queen of England — we had a great time. We had a great time. We have very good relationships in Europe. I would say our relationships are far better now than under the Obama Administration, but they respect us more because they got away with things that were very unfair. Like as an example, Europe, the European nations, if you look at what's happening on trade. O.K., it was really unfair what's been happening on trade. They, we lost, over the years, on average, $150 billion a year on trade with the European — as a group — the European nations. It's very unfair. Then on top of it, we protect them, from NATO, in the form of NATO. And NATO, if you take a look at it, NATO probably, a lot of people would dispute this number, but we were paying 70 to 80% of NATO. That's unfair.\nWell, look, my message is that they're obviously having a big impact, because it's been pulled back and it will be pulled back further. And I think that they've been very effective in their dealings with China. By the way, I have a very good relationship with China, just that they've treated us unfairly with respect to trade for many years. Since the WTO, we've been treated unfairly. We've helped create China. I give them a lot of credit, but we've helped create China. You look at what's happened over the last period of time, and China wants to make a deal. They actually had a deal with us. We were very close to having a deal, and then they pulled back on three major points that were just unacceptable to me. So I'm very happy now collecting 25% on $250 billion, which is what we're doing. But China wants to make a deal, and I don't blame them, because companies are leaving China by the hundreds because they don't want to pay the tariffs. So China's going to want to make a deal.\nWell, I'll tell you what, I'm going to let the protesters speak for themselves. I have our own argument with China, and I think it's going to work out successfully, but I'm going to let China and the protesters work out their own problem. It looks like it's going to be worked out.\nNo, I would view it differently. I would view the Iran situation differently. I think that things could have happened, that Iran would have been a much different country today. When I took over Iran — when I took over as President, when I became President and then took over Jan. 20, Iran was a much different country 2-1/2 years ago. They were unbelievably hostile. They were truly a nation of terror. They were all over the place. We had 14 points of confliction, and they were behind every single one of them. Now it's a different country. They have tremendous problems, problems that nobody would have ever thought they had. And that was not a time to make the deal, the deal that President Obama made. That was a horrible deal. So I terminated that deal, did other things including sanctions, and Iran wants to make a deal also. I will tell you right now. They don't talk [about] it, although sometimes they do. But Iran wants to make a deal, and it's the smartest thing they could do, is to make a deal.\nLook — when I first — One of the first meetings I had was with the Pentagon, and we were talking about the Middle East, which I was always against going in. You know people always like to say, \"Oh, maybe he was too —\" I wasn't. I was always, I was against going into Iraq. It was a terrible… going into the Middle East was a terrible decision. We're into the Middle East for $7 trillion. Many lives, and if you look at both sides, you know, unbelievable numbers of lives — because I look at both sides, I don't just look at the one side. I look at both sides. It was a terrible decision to go in. It's quicksand. Always has been, always will be. And we're doing just fine. We did ISIS. We're doing fine in terms of Afghanistan. We're down to half — we'll soon be down to about 8,000 soldiers.\nWell, you know, I'm open whenever they're ready. Let's see, we have a long way to go before we get there, but I'm open when they're ready. But if you remember, sometimes it's hard to place yourself back in time, but if you go back 2-1/2 years, we had an absolute disaster going on. It was — Iran was causing problems like nobody' —\nWell, so far, it's been very minor. And so far, if you look at the rhetoric now compared to the days when they were signing that agreement, where it was always, \"Death to America, death to America, we will destroy America, we will kill America.\" I'm not hearing that too much any more, and I don't expect to, by the way. I don't expect to. A lot difference. Rhetorically you understand.\nLook at when they were signing the agreement, they were all screaming death to America as they're signing the agreement? What's that all about? They picked up the seven sailors, and the only reason the sailors — the 10 sailors — the only reason the sailors were let go is that we started making massive payments to them the following day. Otherwise the sailors would still be there under President Obama.\nNo, we'll have — we'll have, over 400, We're building the wall right now. People don't understand. We are building the wall right now. It is under major construction.\nWell, there's 550 miles. 550 is max.\nAnd we will have over 450 miles built by the end of next year. We're also renovating tremendous amounts of wall. We're renovating and fixing. We're putting — areas that didn't have wall, we're putting temporary walls in. We're doing a great job, and the job we did with Mexico, nobody could even believe.\nBecause they're trying to come in because the economy is so good. We have 3.5% unemployment. The economy is — you could make the case it's never been stronger than it is now, and the people are trying to come up for the economy. They're not coming up for asylum. They're coming up for money.\nNo, no, I'm not going to make it bad. I'm just saying it wasn't good. The economy wasn't very good, and it was weak under President Obama. Now it's the strongest economy we've probably ever had.\nEven look at the First Quarter, we're at 3.2%. Nobody expected that. They thought it would be one — you know, the First Quarter is always very low. We're at 3.2%. The economy is so strong that people are coming up. Now what I did with Mexico is, Mexico — I don't know if you've seen, but the numbers are way down since they started last week, and they haven't even — they're putting their — they're starting to move the 6,000 soldiers in tomorrow.\nAnd I think they're working very hard.\nSo let me tell you about that. It's very interesting. President Obama had separation. I'm the one that brought it together. I was the one, and what that did is it made more people come up because I didn't like separation any more than you did. But if you look at those cells, where they were showing all these cells, they looked like jail cells or cyclone fence — but they look like jail cells. They were built in 2014 by Obama. I think you people had one of those pictures actually. You said look at these cells. It turned out they were built by Obama. They were built by people that I know very well. People that want to come into the Administration. But if you look at the separation policy, I had that policy, and then I'm the one that put the families back together. When you put the families back together, you have more families come up. It's a very simple …\nNo, but you understand what I'm saying.\nI inherited separation.\nWell, they had that under Obama's watch, too.\nMany of those records were Obama records, and they had separation and they had the exact same thing during the Obama years. The difference is because our economy is so strong, more people came up. Plus, they learned how weak our laws are. Now the laws, hopefully, are going to be changed. But they learned how weak the laws are. But you know, if Mexico does the job, they have very strong policy; they have very strong immigration policy. If Mexico does the job, there should be very few people coming up through Mexico. And Mexico can do the job. And I believe they will do the job, but if they don't do the job, we're going to put tariffs on, and they understand that, and the tariffs are very significant.\nI don't think they will continue to grow. I think they're starting to go down now.\nWell, they have lists. They have very accurate lists actually. But you have to understand, they were separated with President Obama. They were separated with President Bush. I didn't change the policy, and the policy had been changed, it was — I'm the one that ended separation. Just so we understand. And when we ended separation, and I was not surprised to see this, more families came up because now they're not going to be separated.\nI don't know, I don't like it, I don't like the concept of separation. I'd rather keep them from coming up, it would be a lot easier because I don't like it. But I'm — it's crazy. I got such a bad rap on that. I inherited separation.\nYou do know this, right Sarah?\nThese were the laws, President Bush had them, President Obama had them. I had them. And when I had them, everybody went wild about separation, nobody talked about separation before. But Obama, President Obama is the one that built the jail cells, as they called them, and they said \"Look at these cells, isn't this terrible?\" I said, wait a minute — and we didn't know that, and then they stepped forward — those pictures were perhaps in your magazine in 2014. That was long before I became President.\nAll of those cells were built in 2014, and before. And they made it sound like I did it. Look, just so we understand, separation has been there for a long time. When I got there, I ended separation. I knew what would happen. More people would come up, but I didn't like the concept of separation. It was bad. Now what we're doing, if this works with Mexico, there will be a trem—. Look, they're putting 6,000 soldiers on their southern border. That's a game-changer.\nWe are now bringing people back into Mexico.\nNo, I don't. I think I'm good. I think they're vulnerable. No, I think the Democrats are totally vulnerable. I think we're doing a great job on immigration.\nLook, I'm building a wall despite the fact that the Democrats don't want a wall built. They have fought every — we just won a lawsuit on the wall. I don't know if you saw that, a big one, a very important one, against Nancy Pelosi in the House. They sued us, and we won a lawsuit last week, a very big one. We're building a wall, the wall is going up as we speak. We've already renovated vast amounts of wall, taking inferior product and making it very good, very strong. We had walls, we built walls in San Diego.\nNo, no, we fixed walls, and in some cases, we have added massive amounts of barbed wire because the walls were not effective the way they were. And we used the walls as a structure for the barbed wire, and now that the barbed wire is up, nobody is coming across. They can't come across. The walls have become very effective, and they were very ineffective before. You could climb them, you can't climb them now. But we're also building large numbers of new wall. If you want, I can get the Army Corps of Engineers to tell you exactly what we're building, but we're building — we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year.\nAnd that's despite the — no, that's right. That's despite. We're taking some from the military. We're taking some from the drug enforcement. We're taking — we have different pockets where we're taking it.\nNorth Korea?\nBut they will be. Look, we've gotten remains back. That will start up again. We have gotten our prisoners back. We had four prisoners, got them back.\nWe got our prisoners back. We don't have nuclear testing. We don't have any testing, we don't have — other than short-range missiles, which they did a couple of like every other countries test short-term, these were standard short-term missiles — there are no ballistic missiles being tested. There's no nuclear tests, and we have a very good relationship.\nUh, yeah. Will you show me that letter, the birthday letter, do you have it? Get it for me. I'll show it to you.\nYes, please.\nO.K., here — I ended separation — which Obama had, which Bush, which everybody had. I ended separation. One thing. But the biggest thing is the economy is so strong, and the Democrats — the only reason we have this is because the Democrats won't fix the loopholes. The loopholes are terrible, and they won't fix asylum. We could have them fixed in 15 minutes, but they refused to fix it. The only reason we have a problem at the border — and with that problem comes the fact that people learned about their legal rights on the border — the Democrats could fix the asylum problem and the loophole problem in 15 minutes. If they did that, everything would immediately stop. The border would be 100% secure. Now, when you add Mexico to it, and then you fix — then you really have a great secure situation. But I think Mexico will solve most of the problem by itself. But the Democrats have to fix these asylum problems. I mean we have asylum — we have an asylum situation that is so ridiculous. We're the only country in the world with the things that we have to do, and the Democrats could easily fix it, but they want open borders — which means crimes, it means drugs.\nThis isn't over. This is a negotiation. Don't underestimate the fact, and the other thing is in the trade deal, which assuming it gets approved, Mexico's paying hundreds of billions of dollars over a period of time more than they were paying previously. I mean can that count for a wall that's a fraction of the numbers you're talking about? You know, in the U.S.M.C.A. That deal is .. .in other words, that deal is much more lucrative for the United States than NAFTA.\nHere's the ISIS maps. You probably have to look at them together. So, here, I'll show you. That's where I took over. That was halfway through. And this is like now, or something, yep.\nThat would be pretty impressive. I assume you want them; I assume you're going to put that in your front page. So this is ISIS —\nHave you seen this? No, seriously.\nBut here you have nothing. The caliphate is gone. This doesn't mean you don't have crazy people around that, you know? And bombs — I'm not saying any fighting is finished because with these people, you never know. They're totally — they're stone-cold crazy. But there's ISIS. There it is a year later. And there it is now. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad —\nI hope you're going to write it. Do you want to keep them? Can we give them?\nDo you want something to drink, folks?\nOK.\nThat's all right, let them have it. If we do, maybe I'll get my first good cover of TIME since I got elected. The first story was great. The first story, when I won the election, that was written by a gentleman with like a French name.\nWho?\nNo. French. Is there like a French name?\nDo I bet?\nMy whole life is a bet.\nWell, I don't have a bet. I think that Biden is not the same Biden. Something's going on there. O.K.? I would say that probably a progressive wins. Look, when a progressive gets out, another progressive is going to take 100% of the vote, so it's —\nWell, yeah, I think they pick up close to 100%. I think they pick up much of that vote. I think that Harris has not surged, as they say. I think that Bernie is going in the wrong direction. I think Biden is going in the wrong direction. He's dropped a lot. He's come down a lot. If you look at our friend Pocahontas, she is doing pretty well. She's doing pretty well. They forgot that she's a fraud. She's doing … you know she's the one that's doing, it seems, the best in terms of that. I don't believe Mayor Pete has a chance, I never did. I don't see it.\nHere's a letter, O.K., now I'm going to show you this letter. So this was written by Kim Jong-un. It was delivered to me yesterday. By hand.\nI just don't feel it.\nWhat was that?!\nUh — I don't know. Look, I think I've done so much. Could you bring the list of things, please, give me four of them.\nI've done more in 2-1/2 years than any President in the history of this country. And when you look at the things … I'm going to give you a list. Nobody's approved what we've approved; nobody's gotten through. Whether it's the Vets and Choice, and accountability. Both two things you could never get approved. They could never get them approved. You look at the tax cuts, you look at ANWR. You look at the individual mandate. I've had a lot to do with healthcare. You look at right-to-try. Add right-to-try with the individual mandate.\nThe individual mandate of Obamacare. We ended it. That's where you had to pay for —\nYou had to pay not to pay for insurance — to pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying. One of the most unpopular part. We'll get great healthcare after — if we win back the House. And keep the Senate. Keep the presidency.\nThat's pretty new. Here's a list of the things, each spot, each line is another thing. Nobody has done this. These are all between bills and things. I'd like you to keep it. Take a look.\nI agree with that. I don't think — I think I'm getting credit, but I'm not getting the full credit. If the Democrats had won the 2016 race, instead of being up 3.1%, I think it would be down 5%. I think we would actually be down because what — what I — I had the largest cut in regulations in the history of the country. In two years, I cut more regulations than any other President, no matter how long their term was. That was a big factor in terms of what's happened with the country, with the thing. With the whole — with the whole success that we've had. If the Democrats got in, they wouldn't have done that and they would have put more regulation on, and you would have been in — you would have seen a real mess. Here's that. Do you see what I'm saying with that letter? It's pretty good, right? I mean this is pretty good.\nShort-range, extremely short-range. And no different than anyone else tests and launches, et cetera. Can I have that letter back you have?\nI — I'm — I have the exceptions, and I've always been for the exceptions, and I think that's very important.\nWe're studying it all. I mean, it's a very evolving topic, but I am for exceptions.\n— It has to be that way — I have been very strong on that.\nGo ahead.\nI don't think they — I don't think they did that. And frankly, I could have ended that — Mueller — immediately under Article II, if I wanted to. Article II, we don't even talk about Article II because there's no reason to talk about it. But I could have ended Mueller immediately. I could have done that, I decided not to do that. I had the power to do it if I wanted to do it. So there has never been a President that's been as transparent as I've been. 1.5 million pages of documents. I gave… 300 or 500 people, testified. I allowed many people, including White House counsel, to testify. Hundreds of subpoenas, in fact, I think thousands of subpoenas I said — I didn't exert presidential prerogative. I didn't use presidential prerogative in any way, shape or form.\nLet me tell you this. I could have ended the whole thing very quickly. Very easily. I said let it play out, and the bottom line was no collusion, and subject to a review of the documents, no obstruction by the Attorney General. After he reviewed the documents, he found no obstruction. That result has driven the Democrats crazy, crazy. These people have gone absolutely insane.\nOn obstruction. You mean on a no-crime. You mean there was no crime. So there was no crime taken and —\nWell, here's what I don't — I'll go a step further. It was a crime committed by the other side. Not only was there no crime on my side, and he found no collusion and he found no conspiracy, right, do you agree with that? No conspiracy, no collusion, no nothing?\nNo, and he also … excuse me … what did he say? He said, in fact, there was pushback. He said they pushed back. Our staff pushed back.\nNo, no, no — he said there was pushback.\nPresident Obama in September was told by the FBI about Russia. He did nothing. Hillary Clinton went out and paid a man who went to Russia and used Russians and paid Russians. They did nothing. A lot of the bloggers that you read about, O.K.? You read about these bloggers. They were on Hillary's side and Trump's side. The so-called — was it 24 numerous — And you're talking about — she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and Facebook and everything else.\nI didn't limit the investigation.\nI could have told Sessions myself if I wanted to. Under Section II —\nconfidentially, I didn't give it to you to take photographs of it — So don't play that game with me. Let me just tell you something. You take a look —\nWell, I told you the following. I told you you can look at this off-the-record. That doesn't mean you take out your camera and start taking pictures of it. O.K.? So I hope you don't have a picture of it. I know you were very quick to pull it out — even you were surprised to see that. You can't do that stuff. So go have fun with your story. Because I'm sure it will be the 28th horrible story I have in TIME Magazine because I never — I mean — ha. It's incredible. With all I've done and the success I've had, the way that TIME Magazine writes is absolutely incredible.\nTell them five seconds.\nWith all I've done, with the tremendous success I've had, that TIME Magazine writes about me the way they write is a disgrace, O.K.? Let's face it, it's a disgrace. And some day within the next 20 years, maybe you'll pick me as Man of the Year. O.K., big deal. But with all that we've said, now — go back to the Mueller Report. You have 18 people who hated Donald Trump, who were angry Democrats, many of whom supported the Democratic Party financially. Right? You have Bob Mueller who was conflicted, totally conflicted. You know my feeling on that. Comey was his friend. I had a nasty business dispute with him when he was in private life. A very nasty business dispute. Right? You know about that, right?\nNo, I don't want to provide you details, there's no reason to. What difference, you won't write it the way it's proper anyway. But I had a nasty business dispute with Comey. And you know the other disputes, also we had. And he sat, see that chair you're in? He was right in that chair, wanting the job to be the FBI Director, and I said no. O.K.? That's a conflict of interest. Despite that, he said no collusion. First chapter. No collusion. No conspiracy. Push back. Push back. So now they have a phony crime and they say I tried to obstruct a phony crime. But you see, but I didn't. I didn't. And more importantly, under Article II, I could have done whatever I wanted. I could have fired Mueller if I wanted, but I didn't, because if anybody checked out Richard Nixon, that didn't work out so well. Alright? But I could have — I could have fired — I had the right under Article II to fire Robert, but I didn't. And I didn't want to. I figured, let him finish his report. Let's see. The report came out, no collusion. Collusion being the biggest thing, meaning conspiracy. Or whatever they want to call it. And the report was very clear on that. And remember, take a look — there was actually in fact push back, do you agree with that, Sarah? They actually had push back from our people. Not only didn't they accept, but there was push back. And then Phase two, they set up a crime. What about Hillary Clinton's 33,000 emails? What about the fact that she paid Christopher Steele for a fake phony dossier — tremendous amounts of money — her and the DNC. If you guys wrote the real story, you'd end up doing very well. You'd end up with Pulitzer Prizes. I'll tell you there are people that should get Pulitzer Prizes, but they aren't the ones that got 'em. The ones that got 'em should hand 'em back because they called this thing very wrong.\nSo we're rebuilding the military, which is creating jobs. We're doing some really good things in health care. We're doing some tremendous things in health care. You see what's happening with some of the policies that we're coming out with. We got rid of, as I said, we got rid of the individual mandate, which was by far the most popular thing in Obamacare. We're managing Obamacare much better. But Obamacare is a very — it's very bad. And if we win, I will do healthcare. If we get the House. If we get back the House — you can't do it without the House.\nIf we get the House, we get the Senate, we get the presidency, we will have a great health care plan, we will have tremendous healthcare. But we're doing a good job on that anyway. Doing a very good job.\nOur military is strong. We are withdrawing — if you look from the Middle East end, we may have a problem with Iran. That could happen. A thing like that could happen, absolutely.\nBut it could also be that things work out. If Iran does the right thing, it would be a very good thing for Iran, but I don't know that they'll do the right thing. I have a feeling they probably will.\nSure. I am. We all have our meetings. But I generally do my own thing. Like for instance, they had the Stephanopoulos interview, and I said, you know, let me watch this, and then it said both things — did you see that? Where I said, yeah, I'd do both.\nI said, where's the dispute here? Where's the dispute? It was made up by the fake news media. I said I'll do both. Then I also said I would report them. I'm not talking about the Fox & Friends a day later. I'm talking about just if you go by that interview. But for the most part they didn't put the \"I'll do — I'd do both.\" I said, yeah, I'd do both. Nobody wanted to hear that.\nWell, I've said, you know what? I've answered it so many different ways — I answered it in Stephanopoulos, I answered the same question on Fox. But number one, I don't think they'd do it with me because they know I love the country —\nYou mean if they helped the opponent?\nLook, if this was reversed, where the Republicans did this to a Democrat, every one of them would be in jail for years already. O.K.? If they did — if this was reversed, where I did to them what they did to me, the repercussions would be enormous. The press is protecting the DNC, the Democrats, crooked Hillary. They're totally protected by the press. They're partners, let's face it. They're partners. Look at TIME Magazine. I read a couple of stories in TIME Magazine that were so bad, it was unbelievable. It was unbelievable.\nBad coverage, though. I should get good coverage. I built one of the strongest economies, I built probably the strongest economy, certainly one of them, but the strongest. I mean you could go by many — go by unemployment. African Americans, Asians, Hispanics, the strongest they've ever had. More people working today, almost 160 million. By far more than we've ever had working. You know, you could make the case, this is the greatest economy we've ever had. I built that. If Hillary would have gotten in, it would have been decimated. Instead of being at 3.2, we'd be at minus-5 or minus-6. It was going bad. If you look at the numbers from the end of the Obama, it was crashing. It was crashing. And here's the good news. We have tremendous potential. Maybe it depends to a certain extent on what happens with some trade deals, but we've already done the deal with North Korea. It's totally done, it's really good. I took a bad deal, I terminated it, and I made it a good deal. Got the 25% on trucks, on small trucks, et cetera, et cetera, which was terminated. Which is frankly very interesting. You ought to look at this sometime. The Chicken Tax. It's the most successful vehicle built in the automobile industry in America today. I was able to do it. But we did the deal — KORUS —you know, the deal with North Korea — the deal with South Korea. We did pretty much everything I've set out to do is either done or on its way to being done. Now, when you look at that list, and you go point by point by point by point, you say does this gentleman ever take it easy?\nI'd love to broaden it. I think I have one of the greatest — you know there are those who say I have the greatest base in the history of American politics because it always stays at 45, 46, 47. I mean it's been — today it's at 51. Wasn't Rasmussen 51? 51. And I'll tell you, you know, Rasmussen — you know — it's respected — they got the election the best. That's why I say Rasmussen because they got the election the most right. Los Angeles Times, Rasmussen, and I think it was Business Insider, believe it or not, three polls got it very good. But Rasmussen was good. That's at 51%. But I have a base of 45, 46% that is a phenomenal base.\nTHE PRESIDENT (to aide): I've got it. Thanks. I got it.\nI have a base that's a phenomenal — it's just a phenomenal base. It's a very loyal base and I'm loyal to them also. With that being said, the thing that I have that's different, because based on the economy, I should be up 15 or 20 points higher. It should be, just based on the economy. You know it's the economy, stupid, right? Based on the economy, I should be at much higher numbers than I am. And the thing that I have that nobody's ever had before, from the day I came down the escalator, I have had a phony witch hunt against me. And not long after that day, you understand, from the day and you look at the insurance policy by crooked FBI agents, where they talked about the insurance policy just in case Hillary Clinton should lose. The insurance policy. We lived the insurance policy, if that's what it was.\nThis was spying on a campaign. This was — what happened to me as President should never happen to another President again. And I'm honored to have gone through it. There are those that say that very few people that they know could have taken it. I spoke with Lindsey Graham. He said, \"You know what? There's not a person I know in the world that could have taken what you've taken. And you've come out stronger for it.\"\nBut I really believe that there are very few people [who] could have taken it. From Day One, it's been a phony witch hunt with a phony dossier with phony FISA court — the whole thing was a phony deal. It was a fraud. It was a woman that deleted 33,000 emails after getting a subpoena from Congress, and she had no problem doing it. If I ever deleted one email, if I did one email and deleted it, I'd have nothing but serious, serious problems. It is a partnership between the media and the Democratic Party. And it's a shame. It's really a shame. Nobody's gone through and nobody has been treated as unfairly as Donald Trump. And almost everybody admits that.\nI think it's cost me — yeah, and it's phony, and I think that will turn around because it's been proven to be phony. The whole thing. Impeachment. Impeachment for what? Nothing was done wrong. Impeachment for what?! There was no collusion, nothing was done wrong. You know there are those that say — Alan Dershowitz wrote a piece the other day that it's illegal to impeach him. There's nothing done wrong, you can't impeach\nIt might. I mean a lot of people say it would. Most people say it would. I don't know, I really don't know. But I think it's inappropriate, when somebody wins — The only thing I did wrong was winning an election. By winning an election, I made them so angry. I'll tell you what, winning an election and building a great economy — and by the way, doing all those things on the pages that I gave you.\nI mean it's just — it's so many different things and nobody ever thought — even ANWR. So ANWR is among the biggest oil finds in the world, in Alaska. Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved, everybody tried to get it approved. Nobody got it approved. I got it approved. They are starting ANWR shortly. I got ANWR approved. It's as big as Saudi Arabia they say, in Alaska. I got it approved. Nobody else got it approved. Ronald Reagan tried, couldn't do it. Bush tried. Everybody. Presidents, even Democratic presidents tried. They couldn't get it approved. I got it approved.\nSo the only thing I'm guilty of is that I happened to win an election that some people thought I shouldn't have won. Look, we're going — I don't know if anybody's going tomorrow, but I'm going to an event tomorrow where we have 116,000 people?\n120,000 people have requested tickets. We have the big Orlando Basketball Arena, with the floor, it holds 25,000 people. It sold out in the first day. It sold out in the first hour. And we have 120,000 people. I went to Texas to help Ted Cruz. We had 106,000 people. We had to take ads asking people not to come. Tomorrow, what we did is we put big screens up, television screens because the arena is so — these are big arenas. This is the size of Madison Square Garden. I think it's slightly larger. It's where the Orlando Magic plays. It is packed. We'll have thousands and thousands of people outside. O.K., that's one.\nNow Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, he goes to a high school gymnasium that holds 300 people. And they can't get 88 people. Or he has 88 people show up. I don't get it. Where's the magic? Where's the magic?\nSo we're going to have 25,000 people tomorrow, we're going to have 120,000 requests for seats. Many of those people, you'll probably have 20, 30,000 people outside the arena. And Biden goes, he can't fill up 100 seats! So I think we're going to do very well.\nWell, look, it starts as of tomorrow. But for the first eight or nine months, it'll be very, much more limited. Probably one rally every two, three weeks. And then it will get tighter. And then, you know I did six or seven a day toward the end of the campaign.\nThat was one thing I never — I went to Michigan, we had 32,000 people that final night, right? Hillary was there the day of, the day I was there. I actually bled into the Election Day. I started speaking at 1 o'clock in the morning. We had 32,000 people. She got there four hours earlier, which is primetime, she had 500 people show up.\nAnd then I said why am I going to lose Michigan? And I didn't. You know? I didn't. So we have a lot of things going, and I'll tell you one interesting thing you may focus on. The witch hunt has made our base stronger. It's made our people more resilient. And the witch hunt has done a lot of things. It's told — it's told the story of the dishonesty and a lot of the problems, you know, the swamp. All of the things that we've talked about. But I think we have more energy than the Democrats do by far. You don't hear that as much. I have never seen energy like I see right now.\nThat might happen. No. It might happen. But I think my base is so strong, I'm not sure that I have to do that. But I'd like to do it, just as President, I'd like to do it. Not for political reasons. I'd like to do it as President. The Russian hoax that they've put us through has hurt our country, and it's made our country much more divided than it should have been. If I didn't have that situation happen, which is totally — and by the way, now we've been exonerated by the Mueller Report. Again, these are people that hated Donald Trump. How do you pick all people who are opposed to me? And I still got a great report. Had we not had that, the country would have been much more united than it is. That was a very bad thing for the country. What they did with the phony witch hunt was a very bad thing, and it's bad now, what they're doing. You know, when they try to keep — They want a do-over. The Mueller Report was a disaster for the Democrats. They want a do-over.\nNo, I think it's turned out to be an asset because it's really energized our base, like I've never seen before.\nYeah, but they do with every — maybe they do. And by the way, I would be surprised if it was only Russia —\nI know. But I would be surprised if it's not China, and if it's not other countries. I think it's much more —\nOh, we do — well, we've done things that Obama didn't do. When the FBI went to Obama in September, and they told him about this, he did nothing because he thought Hillary Clinton was going to win, and he didn't want to rock the boat.\nThank you.\nNo. Good. Thank you.\nBut the truth is, Obama, whatever was going on, Obama knew about it long before I ever heard about it. And he didn't do anything about it. And then his statement to the President of Russia about, \"Hey, I'll see Vladimir after the election is over.\" Look, folks, it's been a very unfair period of time. But we've gone through it. And we'll do very well. I think we're going to do very well in the election.\nI think we're going to have a big success. And if I win it again, I might even make the TIME Magazine cover again. Maybe. I doubt it. But maybe. You know.\nOh, do you come out on Thursday?\nAnyway, thank you all very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-time-magazine-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News", "Date": "2019-06-25", "Text": "Well, I think people learned a lot yesterday watching a very poor performance and watching things that they couldn't believe when they saw what was going on. And hopefully we're going to be able to find out how a thing like this started. It was a disgrace to our country. It was a disgrace from every standpoint, and I would say that most people have never seen anything like it. Then, on top of it, you watched that performance, it was shocking and very sad.\nSay it, Sean?\nSo, I wasn't going to watch at all, and then I started thinking about it, and then I watched a little bit at the very beginning and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I ended up watching more than I wanted to. Then I watched the afternoon, because it was such a big crater at the beginning and I said, \"Now I have to watch Shifty Schiff,\" because he just went through three hours and now he has to go through Schiff and I said, \"This is going to be very interesting.\" I've never seen anything like it, actually. It was sort of good television. I couldn't watch it all. I had meetings, I had economic development meetings that I was saying \"Fellas, maybe we could move it to another time,\" but I didn't want to do that.\nI got to watch enough and it was shocking. I thought the Republicans represented themselves brilliantly, actually. John Ratcliffe and Jim Jordan and all of them, Louie Gohmert. I could mention 15 names or however many they have that spoke. It got fairly close to that number. I guess maybe it was a little bit less than that, but I will tell you that everybody representing the Republicans I thought was really good and I thought the other side was typically biased, but they were stuck with a situation that they couldn't believe.\nWell, based on the fact that we've just become fairly recently, a little while ago, the number one oil and gas producer and energy producer in the world by far, Russia, Saudi Arabia, now second and third. Based on the fact that we will soon have the most modern military we have ever had with the best equipment, the best newest planes, and all of the things that we've done and so many other things. Sean. Based on all of that, the last person they should want is me.\nBut I have heard the same thing about the fake dossier. I've heard it came out of Russia. I think a lot of it also was made up. It was just made up out of like you'd write a novel, but it was a fake, and it was paid for by the Democrats and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC. And it's incredible. These are incredible stories. Nobody would write a novel like this cause people wouldn't believe it. It wouldn't be believable.\nBecause this should never happen to another president of the United States again. This is a absolute catastrophe for our county. This was a fake witch hunt and it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. This was treason. This was high crimes. This was everything as bad a definition as you want to come up with, this should never be allowed to happen to our country again.\nWell, I think the press has lost all credibility, much of it, but it's lost a big part of it, though. I mean, a very substantial part of it, lost all credibility. I watch it as people scream at these poor Democrats, the Congressmen scream like I've never seen. \"You must do this. You must do that.\" These are supposed to be journalists, show hosts, all sorts of people. I cannot believe it.\nAnd they're actually trying to force them to do what they want to be done. I've never seen anything like it. They use the word unhinged. They are unhinged. The media has become totally unhinged. They're very dishonest. And when I say enemy of the people, when people give purposely false stories and when they try and get politicians to do things that are wrong and they know they're wrong, that really is the enemy of the people. It's fake news, but it's the enemy of the people, more importantly.\nSo I had the absolute right to fire him, but I didn't. And I never suggested to do it, but I had the absolute right to fire him under Article II and perhaps for other reasons, but I didn't do it. I didn't do any of the… When they say he said he was going to do this or said he was going to do, I didn't do any of it. It's really incredible when I hear this and the whole concept of obstruction. First of all, they create a phony crime, which was just a terrible thing to say about somebody, especially somebody that loves the country as much as I do. So they create this phony crime and then they say he obstructed. They said there was no collusion but he obstructed. There has never been anything like this ever before in our country.\nThe crime was committed on the other side, and we'll find out about that. We have a great attorney general who's looking at it. I'm not involved in that. He's looking at it.I've been hearing a lot of the media actually is talking about investigate the investigators and a lot more than that.\nAnd I think that things are… I just see it. I feel it. I think a lot of good is going to come out of it. We went through hell. A lot of people went through hell. They came down to Washington wanting to do a phenomenal job for the people and they get served with papers to come and testify and go before grand jurors. And by the way, nothing affected the… Because all of these things like the Russian bloggers, they had nothing to do with us and everybody knew it. In fact, there is a little sentence in there saying that it had nothing to do with the Trump Administration.\nBut it was a lot of people, 24 people or something. A lot of bloggers, bloggers in Russia, they'll never see these people. They know that. They sent out papers to these people. They'll never ever see them. The people probably never even got the papers. But all of these people, none of them had… They went through people with old tax cases, old cases, cases that were not even going forward, just went after them viciously and violently.\nGeneral Flynn, who's a good man, what they did to General Flynn and so many others. Hope Hicks, this wonderful young woman. And she spent much of her time in Washington fighting off horrible stories and things. She's just a high quality person. So many, I could name almost everybody, what they went through, and still to this day, I mean I heard people saying that… I heard some of the media saying that they thought Mueller performed okay. In other words, they let a day go by and then they'll try and spin it. These are very dishonest people. These are very bad people.\nWell, I don't want to comment on that as far as the pardons are concerned. Yes, it is absolute and it's a beautiful thing. I've had people, Jack Johnson, the heavyweight champion of the world in the early 1900s and he went to jail for no reason, and so many other things. And Alice Johnson's another good example, and I really feel good about giving it where people have been treated unfairly and abused actually.\nTo what's going on now. I mean it's in a way I think there's a whole new day starting. I used to use and I still use drain the swamp. We have some very, very bad people in government that would be willing to do very bad things and for bad reasons. So I don't mention pardon, but I don't say what's going to happen in the future. I just don't comment on it.\nWell, Comey is a liar and a leaker, and that's obvious and all you have to do is just follow him along and see what he said to Congress. Clapper and Brennan and all of these people, McCabe, these are bad people. My opinion, they are very bad people. They've been very bad for the country. They were, I used to think incompetent, but they're really I guess competent at other things and maybe bad things. But you we'll see what happens. I mean I guess a lot of things are coming out and it's going to be very interesting and it will be great to clean up a real big mess, because again, it can never happen. This can never be allowed to happen again, Sean.\nWell, we have a very respected gentleman, a very high quality person named William Barr. I can tell you, he's working so hard. Rather than just doing a total release, I gave him a total release. In other words, he's got everything. Anything he needs, he's got. He's the Attorney General of the United States. He's got a lot of very good people under him that I guess are involved and I gave them a total release.\nSo all of it's been released and he has all of it. I've also given him authorization to release it to whoever he wants, whether it's his people or frankly perhaps people like Devin Nunes who is a star, what he's done and the amount of suffering he's gone through. You know what they did with him, where they tried to drive him right out of politics and probably worse than that. He's done an incredible job.\nAnd so many others. They're warriors. I'll tell you the good side of all of this is the level of intelligence and strength and goodness that we've had on the Republican Party. A lot of them, not everybody of course, but we've had tremendous, and when I say we, I'm talking about the country. The country's had tremendous support from Meadows and Jordan and Devin Nunes. And so many of the names that you saw yesterday performed so well. I mean, they performed so well and they worked so hard because they saw this was a scam. This was an illegal takeover, as you'd say in the business world. I mean, this was a coup attempt in my opinion.\nThis is the United States and we wouldn't stand for it and I wouldn't stand for it. We have some very great people, but we also have some very bad people. And I think we caught then.\nWell, it's very interesting because I haven't seen it at all for the last four or five days. They're not talking about the Democrats. They're talking about Mueller and how bad he performed, how badly he performed. And they're talking about everything that happened over the last few days, but in particular yesterday. You're not seeing much about the Democrats. But look, you've got a few of them that are doing a little bit better than others. It'll be interesting. Whoever it is, I'm okay with it.\nWe have the best economy we've ever had. As you know, we have the best stock market numbers we've ever had in the history of our country. If you look at 401Ks, if you look at the kind of money that people are making. I'm not talking about rich people or just rich people. I'm talking about everybody. Blue collar workers went up proportionately more than anybody. You saw that poll that just came out. Things are doing great. The best unemployment numbers, the best employment numbers. I'll tell you what, more people working in the United States today than at any time in the history of our country.\nAnd then we have the lowest unemployment numbers, especially for African-Americans, for Hispanics, for Asians. Women are almost 70 years the best numbers, and soon to be historic meaning forever., meaning from the beginning. I think we'll be in great shape. Then you have the AOC. I call it AOC plus three. The three hangers.\nI really believe they're going to hurt the Democrats. But who knows? I mean, we'll see. But I think we're going to do very well, Sean. I think we're going to do very well. We have tremendous spirit. You've never seen an empty seat. We go into these massive arenas and they're packed and there's thousands of people outside. You've never seen an empty seat. So I think we're going to do very well.\nWell, I could say that obviously the top three or four look like they had doing better than the rest. So Sleepy Joe is okay, but he's fading. I think he's fading fast. The only good thing about Mueller is it made Joe Biden look like a dynamo. When you watched Mueller's performance yesterday. I think probably Biden is the one that asked him to go on.\nYou have him and he's sort of a little bit leading and then you have a whole group. You Have Elizabeth Warren formerly known as Pocahontas, and I'm sure that'll come out because that's a tough thing for her to withstand, I believe, because her whole life was a fake. She used that very, very adeptly and it was not good. And you have Harris and Bernie looks like he's fading to me. Bernie looks like he missed his time. I think what Hillary did a few years ago was pretty tough frankly for Bernie. But that was his time. I don't think it's Bernie's time. I see him flailing. He's flailing all over the place. He's going crazy. I call him Crazy Bernie. But the fact is that I think those would be probably the three or four. Maybe there's another one or two. I don't necessarily see anybody else gaining traction.\nWell, I think that in the case of Iran, they know that better than even you do and probably even stronger than you said it. I think they understand that very well. And in the case of North Korea, I'm actually getting along very well with him, but we'll see what happens. I mean, the sanctions are on, the hostages are back. We're getting the remains back. They haven't done nuclear testing. They really haven't tested missiles other than smaller ones, which is something that lots tests. But I think with North Korea we've been doing very well, but that doesn't mean it's going to continue. We have a relationship. President Obama had no relationship. You would have been at war. Had Hillary Clinton won this election, you'd be at war right now with North Korea. I have no doubt about that. That's where it was heading. It was heading there very rapidly.\nWe'll see what happens. But I think what you said might be somewhat of an understatement.\nWell, it's a bad mayor. Probably the worst mayor in the history of New York City. He's done a bad job and now he's running for president, and people can't even believe it. He's a horrible mayor. The policemen and women cannot stand him. They don't respect him. They don't like him. Remember they turned their back on him a couple of years ago when he got up to speak. Everybody turned their back and they kept it that way and still they want to do it, but they still have respect for the office if not him.\nBut I feel like that was tragic watching that scene a couple of days ago when I first saw it, I couldn't believe it. I said, \"Let me see that again. I don't believe what I'm seeing,\" I know New York's finest and New York's finest, in fact, we were in touch with them today. They are devastated that frankly, that that could happen, and also that those two offices would allow that to happen. That was a terrible thing.\nThank you, Sean. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-fox-news-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Osaka, Japan", "Date": "2019-06-29", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. It's been a really great period of time. I'll be leaving now, as you know, for South Korea. Some of you will be coming with us.\nI understand that we may be meeting with Chairman King—Kim. And we'll find out. We spoke with the people. Kim Jong Un was very receptive. He responded. And so we'll see. Because tomorrow we're going to the DMZ. I said, \"While I'm there, I'll shake his hand.\" We get along. There's been no nuclear tests. There's been no long-range ballistic tests. Gave us back our hostages, which was great. And a lot of good things are happening over there.\nSo I let him know we'll be there, and we'll see. I mean, I don't—I can't tell you exactly, but they did respond very favorably.\nI want to thank everyone for being here today. That's a lot of press. A lot of press is outside too. They're less happy than you are. [Laughter] But the G-20 summit has been fantastic. Prime Minister Abe has done an incredible job, as he always does. And he hosted it very beautifully.\nYou know where it's going to be next year, I think. Do most of you know where it's going to be next year? It's going to be in a very great part of the world. And we'll be announcing exactly what's happening. But this was a really good summit and really well done, so professionally done.\nThis marks my third visit to Japan as President. Melania and I are—we've just left Tokyo a short while ago, as you know—a very short while ago—where we were the first state guests to Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress of Japan. And that was thrilling. First time in 202 years that an event like that took place, so that was quite exciting.\nAnd I'm thrilled to be back. I always like being back in Japan. We've had a great relationship. We've never been closer to Japan than we are right now. Over the past 2 days, leaders from the world's largest economies have convened here at Osaka, which is a tremendous city. You fly over, and you say, \"Does it ever stop?\" It's big. It's beautiful. It's clean. And it's really a—the job they do with industrial manufacturing and lots of other things is really incredible.\nWe had a very productive conversation with a number of the leaders, of not only nations, but business leaders here in Japan. And together, we put together a lot of ideas and a lot of challenges for the future that we'll be able to meet and get things going very well.\nOur meetings also touched on women's economic empowerment. You probably saw that Ivanka Trump was—she's done a fantastic job and also a fantastic job in getting jobs for a lot of people within our country, almost 10 million people. The importance of resilient and secure infrastructure, we discussed that at great length. The need to uphold the rule of law. And the critical importance of achieving a future for international trade that works all of the time for all of the people.\nIn addition to the working sessions—we had a lot of working sessions; many of you were at the working sessions—I had tremendous bilateral meetings with many of the heads of state. And just some of them are Australia, Japan, India, Germany, Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, China, Turkey, U.K. And I met with Mexico also—with the representatives of Mexico who have done an incredible job. They've really stepped up to the plate. I appreciate it and I want to thank them. They have 6,000 troops at their southern border, by Guatemala, and it's very hard to come in now. And they have—they just ordered—really, it was somewhat of a surprise—16,000 troops at our southern border. Their immigration laws are very strong. Ours are a disaster. Ours are a disgrace to our country. We have loopholes and asylum that—we could fix the asylum very quickly. We could get rid of and fix the loopholes, but we could get rid of the loopholes, and we would have absolutely no problem at the border. But if you watch the debates—if you call them debates, you—whatever they were—they don't really—I think they want open borders, I guess—even though, 4 years ago, they wanted walls to be built.\nI heard we just had another judge rule against us on a section of wall, and that's a disgrace. We'll appeal it right away. Ninth Circuit, as usual. They go right into that Ninth Circuit. The good news: I put a lot of judges in, and a number of them are in the Ninth Circuit now. And it's very unfair. It's very unfair when a judge can do what they do, where a judge in a certain area can close down a country. But we also had a big victory last week with the wall. We had a judge in DC who gave us a very big victory.\nSo we're building a lot of wall. But we had a ruling just yesterday, late, from a judge in the Ninth Circuit, again. So we're immediately appealing it, and we think we'll win the appeal. There was no reason that that should've happened. And a lot of wall is being built, and again, Mexico is doing a real job. Our Border Patrol, they've done incredible work. And ICE is—they're just special people. Law enforcement, generally, is just—they're special.\nSo, with that, I just want to say that these meetings have been great. The one that I guess most people are interested in is China. We had a great meeting. President Xi. And we've known each for as long as I'm President. And many of you were at the event in China a year ago, when—I've never seen anything like it. The—it was beautiful. We talked about it; we dinner last night, President Xi and a number of us. And it was something really incredible, in Beijing. The red carpet was rolled out for all of us—for this country, for our country.\nAnd we had a great meeting, and we will be continuing to negotiate. And I promised that, for at least the time being, we're not going to be lifting tariffs on China. We won't be adding an additional tremendous amount of—we have, I guess, $350 billion left, which could be taxed or it could be tariffed. And we're not doing that. We're going to work with China on where we left off, to see if we can make a deal.\nChina is going to start—they're going to be consulting with us, and they're going to start spending money, even during the negotiation, to our farmers, our great farmers in the Midwest. I call them the \"great patriots\" because that's what they are. They're patriots. And China is going to be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural product, and they're going to start that very soon, almost immediately. We're going to give them lists of things that we'd like them to buy.\nOur farmers are going to be a tremendous beneficiary. You know, if you look at farmers—for 15 years, before I came into the—into this position, the farms and farmers have had a hard time. If you look at that graph, it was down, fairly steeply down. And a lot of it was because NAFTA was a terrible deal.\nAnd we have—I spoke with Nancy Pelosi last night about the USMCA—that's Mexico and Canada. And it's now before them, and they'll have to make a decision. But that's one that the farmers love, the manufacturers love, the unions love. It's a great deal for this country. And NAFTA was, I think, one of the worst trade deals ever made.\nMaybe the WTO was worse. The WTO, from the time that happened in '95—from the time that happened, China became like a rocket ship. It was pretty much flatlined, and then, all of a sudden, they joined the WTO, and they became—they went—I mean, they went through the roof. And very much to our liability, it's—we lost tremendous amounts of money over the—from that time. I mean, we just lost tremendous amounts. It was a terrible deal, the WTO, World Trade.\nAnd if you look at NAFTA, NAFTA has been a disaster for our country. The USMCA is a great deal for our country. I think Canada is happy, but they're not happy like we're happy, but they're very happy. It's a good deal for Canada, a good deal for Mexico. They want it. Mexico just approved it in full. Canada is waiting for us to approve it.\nI was with the Prime Minister—just left him a little while ago—and they're thrilled with the deal, and we're thrilled. Everybody wants it. And hopefully, it will be a bipartisan deal. I view that. I told that to Nancy Pelosi. I said, \"View this as a bipartisan deal,\" because a lot of the Democrats want it, especially, I would say, the farmers, but really, the industrial areas also. The unions—we've got things on wages, and we've got things on the environment that few people have ever been able to get into an agreement. And it's a very big deal. It's a very big deal. And it's a great deal, tremendous support.\nSo they have to put it up for a vote. And I think you'll get a great vote in the House, and you'll get a great vote in the Senate. And you'll have a tremendous trade deal between the United States and Canada and Mexico. And it's going to be something very special.\nSo we spend a lot of time with a lot of countries. We do business with a lot of them. Australia is an example. With Japan, we're negotiating with them, because they send us millions of cars and we send them wheat, which doesn't work. But what happens is Japan is—you probably saw some of the things they're doing—but they're opening up many car companies and factories and plants throughout our country, especially in Michigan. We have a lot of activity in Ohio. Beyond Japan activity, we have a lot of activity now where companies are coming back to our country. We're the hot show. We're the hottest show in town. We're the hottest show in the world right now. Our economy is the best.\nOne thing that every leader—virtually every leader that I dealt with said is that: \"Congratulations. It's incredible what's happened to the American economy.\" We're the best economy in the world. And it's something. And it started from election day. I put it out yesterday because we took a tremendous boost from—the day after I got elected, the stock market went crazy, from that point until essentially now. I think we hit, in certain of the markets, we hit the alltime high again for many, many times. I can't tell you what it was, but many, many times, we broke the record.\nAnd we're—you know, our stock market is great. Our jobs are great. We have the best job numbers, essentially, we've ever had, in some categories—definitely—we've ever had. The minimum, you could say, is in 51 years, but it's really more than that, and now it's going to be more than that.\nAfrican American, Asian American—you saw that—Hispanic American: the best numbers in history—the history of our country. We have the lowest unemployment numbers. Best numbers. And many others too. Blue-collar workers are doing fantastic. They're the biggest beneficiary of the tax cuts, the blue collar.\nBlue collar. You know, we talk about for the rich; it's really for everybody. And it's also for big companies where they're moving here. And remember who owns the stocks. Because the people that own the stock, it's not the big companies; it's the people with 401(k)s whose numbers are at 60 percent and 70 percent and 42 percent and all different numbers that are tremendously high—where the other spouse thinks that the spouse that's investing in the 401(k) is a supergenius. But those 401(k)s are very high. And if you listen to what I've been listening to—and we're not going to devote anytime to it—but with that kind of an attitude, their 401(k)s are going to crash and the market would crash because, with what they want to do, you would crash the market, and the amount of wealth that would be lost would be incredible.\nBut I'd rather wait until later in the campaign to say that because, to be honest with you, I want them to go and take these policies and bring them up. I don't want them to change them anytime soon. Let them go have a good time. But it's been very interesting to watch what's happening. Actually, I found it very interesting.\nSo, with that, we'll take a few questions, and then I'm heading out to South Korea. And I may or may not see Kim Jong Un. But we'll be heading out to South Korea, spend about a day and a half there with President Moon, who is a really good guy. He was here too, as you know. I saw him. I met with him also. And we'll see what happens.\nPlease, John [John Roberts, Fox News].\nYes.\nChairman of the State Affairs Commission Kim Jong Un of North Korea/China-U.S. Trade/Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.\nSure, I would. I would. I'd feel very comfortable doing that. I would have no problem.\nWith respect to China, basically, we agreed today that we were going to continue the negotiation—which I ended a while back—and we're going to continue the negotiation. We agreed that I would not be putting tariffs on the $325 billion that I would have the ability to put on if I wanted; that—where, you know, we're fairly advanced, depending on where you want to look at and where you want to start. Pretty advanced.\nWe discussed—we did discuss numerous other things. We mentioned Huawei. I said: \"We'll have to save that until the very end. We'll have to see.\"\nOne of the things I will allow, however, is—a lot of people are surprised—we send, and we sell to Huawei a tremendous amount of product that goes into the various things that they make. And I said that that's okay, that we will keep selling that product. These are American companies, John, that make product. And that's very complex, by the way. Highly scientific.\nAnd in some cases, we're the ones that do it, and we're the only ones that do it. We're the only ones with the technology. What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible actually. And nobody has been able to compete with it. And I've agreed—and pretty easily—I've agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product so American companies will continue. And they were having a problem. The companies were not exactly happy that they couldn't sell because they had nothing to do with whatever was potentially happening with respect to Huawei. So I did do that. We talked about education and students. Somebody was saying it was harder for a Chinese students to come in. And that's something that if it were—if somebody viewed it that way, I don't. We want to have Chinese students come and use our great schools, our great universities. They've been great students and tremendous assets. But we did discuss it. It was brought up as a point, and I said that will be just like anybody else, just like any other nation.\nAnd we're actually going to a point where, you know, we're looking that if you graduate from a college, because our great companies—we talk about Silicon Valley and other places—we have a problem in this—in our country, that you graduate number one in your class from the best school in the country, and you—they say you have to leave; we can't keep them. And we're going to make it—we're going to call it the \"smart person's waiver.\" But we're going to make it so that they can not only stay, but maybe they have access to green cards. We want to keep these people here. We have to keep—yes, go ahead, John.\nSure.\nThat could happen. But we're holding on tariffs and they're going to buy farm product. So you know—so—but that could happen, John.\nThis doesn't mean there's going to be a deal, but they would like to make a deal. I can tell you that. And if we could make a deal, it would be a very historic event. You know, we've never really had a deal with China. We have—we've had tremendous deficits. Tremendous amounts of money was put into China, $500 billion a year. And I mean, you know, not just surplus and deficit. I'm talking about real, hard cash. And it should have never, ever been allowed to have happened for all of our Presidents over the last number of years.\nGo ahead, please.\nJapan-U.S. Defense Cooperation\nGood.\nNo, I'm not thinking about that at all. I'm just saying that it's an unfair agreement. And I've told him that for the last 6 months. I said, \"Look, if somebody attacks Japan, we go after them, and we are in a battle—full force in effect.\" We are locked in a battle and committed to fight for Japan. If somebody should attack the United States, they don't have to do that. That's unfair.\nThat's the kind of deals we've made. That's—every deal is like that. I mean it's almost like we had people that they didn't either care or they were stupid. But that's the kind of deals we have. That's just typical.\nBut I have been—I told him—I said we're going to have to change it. Because—look, nobody is going to attack us, I hope. But you know, should that happen—it's far more likely that it could be the other way—but should that happen, somebody attacks us, if we're helping them, they're going to have help us. And he knows that. And he's going to have no problem with that.\nYes, please.Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.\nWhen what? On what?\nWe didn't discuss Ms. Meng. We didn't—that was not discussed. We did discuss Huawei, but we didn't discuss her situation.\nPotential Russian Interference in 2020 Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Trade\nWell, I did say it. You're to have to take a look at the words. I did say it. And we had a discussion. We had a great—actually, we had a great discussion, President Putin and myself. I thought it was really a tremendous discussion.\nI think they'd like to do trade with the United States. And they have great product. They have great land. They have very rich land. And a lot of oil, a lot of minerals, and the kind of things that we like. And I can see trade going out with Russia. We could do fantastically well. We do very little trade with Russia, which is ridiculous, frankly. So I could see some very positive things happening.\nYes, but as per your question though, I did say it, and I did discuss it a little bit after that too.\nYes, please.\nRussia. Russia. Russia. Isn't it crazy?\nOkay, Jimmy Carter—look, he was a nice man. He was a terrible President. He's a Democrat. And it's a typical talking point. He's loyal to the Democrats, and I guess you should be.\nBut as everybody now understands, I won not because of Russia, not because of anybody but myself. I went out—I campaigned better, smarter, harder than Hillary Clinton. I went to Wisconsin. I went to Michigan the night of the vote. I had 32,000 people at 1 o'clock in the morning on election day. I won Michigan. I won Wisconsin. I won Pennsylvania. I won States that traditionally haven't been won by a Republican, for many years haven't been won by a Republican.\nAnd this had nothing to do with anybody but the fact that I worked harder and much smarter than Hillary Clinton did.\nNow, I'll say this: Jimmy Carter—I was surprised that he would make a statement. I saw it. It was not a big thing, but I saw the statement. And it's—you know, a lot of Democrats like to make that statement. He's been trashed within his own party. He's been badly trashed. I felt badly for him because if you look over the years, his party has virtually—he's like the forgotten President. And I understand why they say that. He was not a good President. Look at what happened with Iran. That was a disaster. What Iran did to him, they tied him up in knots. The reason Ronald Reagan probably because President. So you know, it's a Democrat talking point.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Jim [Jim Acosta, CNN].\nSure.\nNo.\nI don't know that anybody asked me.\nNo, not at all. I don't really care about offending people. I sort of thought you'd know that. [Laughter]\nAnd by the way, congratulations. I understand your book—is it doing well?\nReally?\nWow. Good. Send it. I want to see it.\nSend me a copy.\nNo, I get along with everybody, except you people, actually. [Laughter] I get along with a lot of people. I have a tremendous relationship with President Xi. Nobody else would have the deal that we have. We're getting tens of billions of dollars from China coming in. A lot of things are happening. And despite that, we're moving along towards something that could be very historic.\nBut I get along with President Putin. I get along with Muhammad from Saudi Arabia. Look, I spoke to Saudi Arabia when the oil prices, a year ago, were getting very high. And I wasn't so nice. And I said, \"You've got to get some more oil into the system because what's happening is no good.\" And they did. And the people are driving at, you know, very low numbers right now. You haven't seen. In the old days, you'd have spikes where the gasoline went to $5 and more, and it wasn't so good.\nBut I also get along with people that would be perceived as being very nice. You have a lot of very nice leaders of countries. I was with——\nI was with—wait a minute. I was with Prime Minister May today. I was with so many. You take a look. New head of Australia. Look at Japan—Abe. Prime Minister Abe is a fine—they're all fine, as far as I'm concerned. Some are stronger than others. Some are tougher than others. And a lot of people——\nYes.\nYes, I do. I think it's horrible. Or anybody else, by the way.\nBut I think it's horrible. And if you look, and look into Saudi Arabia and you see what's happening, 13 people or so have been prosecuted. Others are being prosecuted. They've taken it very, very seriously, and they will continue to. And I've let everybody know I'm not—I'm very unhappy about that whole event.\nBut if you look at what's going on—and right now, within Saudi Arabia, they're prosecuting additional people. There's a lot of things happening. At the same time, I will also say—and nobody said—nobody, so far, has pointed directly a finger at the future King of Saudi Arabia. I will say I spoke to his father, Jim. I spoke to his father at great length.\nThey've been a terrific ally. They're creating millions of jobs in this country. They're ordering equipment, not only military equipment, but $400 billion worth of—and actually, even more than that over a period time—worth of different things. And with that being said, I'm extremely angry and unhappy about a thing like that taking place. But, as of this moment, more than 13 people are being prosecuted. And I hear the number is going to be going up. But it's a good question.\nYes, please.\nNorth Korea/China-U.S. Trade/Federal Aid to U.S. Farmers\nYes.\nOh, sure.\nOh, it might happen tomorrow. [Laughter] I mean, to be honest. We won't call it a summit. We'll call it a handshake, if it does happen. I don't know that it will, but it could happen. I know I think he'd like to do it, and I wouldn't mind doing it at all. I'm going to be—I'm literally visiting the DMZ.\nAnd so—but I will—as per your question about President Xi, he's a brilliant leader; he's a brilliant man. And you know better than I, he's probably considered to be one of the great leaders in 200 years, in China. And we just have a very—he's strong; he's tough. But he's good. We have a very good relationship. And I said, you know: \"We can't have it where the United States loses this kind of money for the privilege of building up China. It has to be a fair deal.\" And he understands that.\nBut as he said, \"Nobody ever came to us.\" It's true. No other President came to him. This would've—my Presidency could be a lot easier, not only for that, but for many other reasons. It'd be a lot easier. But I don't want it to be easy. It's a point in time. I have a chance to do things that nobody else has ever done.\nSo we're making a deal with China, or we're attempting. And if we don't, we'll go back into—you know, we have a tremendous ripe field of tremendous money that would be coming into our country. But I have a feeling that over a period of time—and again, I'm not rushed, and I told him that I want to get the deal right. It's extremely—I wouldn't even say complicated, but very intricate.\nBut, in the meantime, I think our farmers are going to end up being the great beneficiary. And what I did with the farmers—because they did lose a certain amount of money—I went to Sonny Perdue, who is our Secretary of Agriculture. I said, \"Sonny, how much money—in the best year—did China spend on our farms, in our farms, buying?\" He said, \"The best year, about $16 billion.\" I said, \"Okay, well, we're taking in much more than that now every year in tariffs.\"\nAnd I took $16 billion out of those tariffs, and—essentially out of those tariffs—and we're distributing it among farmers who have been hurt because they have been used as a pawn so that China could get a good deal.\nBut, in the end, the farmers are going to be the biggest beneficiary. But I've made up for the fact that China was, you know, targeting our farmers. Because they know the farmers like me, and I like them. I love them. And they sort of love me, I guess, when you get right down to it. And it was $16 billion—billion. That's a lot of money. But I took it out the tariff money, essentially, and we are in the process of distributing it.\nThe farmers could not be happier, other than—they're unusual. I had them around a table, many of the farmers, and—about 5 weeks ago—and they said: \"We don't want money. We want just a level playing field.\" I said, \"You're right.\" Most groups want money. They'll take—any way you want to give it to them they'll take.\nThe farmers are in a class by themselves in so many ways. They don't want subsidies. They don't want a handout. All they want to do is have a level playing field. They're unbelievable people, and as I said, they're unbelievable patriots.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].North Korea/U.S. Foreign Policy/Iran\nThank you.\nNo. Of course, I thought of that because I know if he didn't, everybody is going to say, \"Oh, he was stood up by Chairman Kim.\" No, I understood that. It's very hard to—he follows my Twitter.\nI guess so, because we got a call very quickly. [Laughter] A lot of people follow it. But you know, they've contacted us, and they'd like to see if they can do something. And we're not talking about for, you know, extended. Just a quick hello.\nAnd we get along. I get along with him, and I get along with other people. Like, you know, for instance, on Jim's question, it's a fair question, but I really have great relationships with everybody.\nI think—you know, I said a long time ago that maybe I'll be a sleeper on foreign policy. And if you look at what's happened on foreign policy—now, we are working on Iran, and we'll see what happens. I think they'd like to make a deal. I think they'd be very smart to want to make a deal, but we're going to see what happens. I'm okay. I have all the time in the world.\nThey're doing very poorly. They were doing—they were very brutal when I first came in. Eighteen sites of confliction, meaning, where they were behind. But I think on foreign policy, if you look at what's happening—and the other thing that's happening is we're not being taken for suckers anymore.\nI mean, we have countries where we'd lose on defending them, because we defend a tremendous percentage of the world. And they don't pay us for it. And then, on top of it, we lose money with that same country on trade. And it's all changing. And they understand it's changing. And they expect it to change. They can't believe.\nHonestly, like, I'd ask Prime Minister Abe—I said, \"How did this happen, where you send us billions and billions of dollars' worth of cars and other things, and we send you practically nothing?\" He said, \"Nobody ever complained.\" Same thing with China. I said: \"You know, you send a car to us. We charge you essentially nothing. It's 2½ percent, but basically, you don't have to—there are ways around that. So you send a car to us, and you pay nothing. We send a car to you, made in the United States, and we have to pay 45-percent tariff. How did that happen? He said, \"We just kept lifting it, lifting it, lifting it.\" I mean, they're being honest with me. \"We just kept lifting it, and nobody called.\" But I call. I call.\nGo ahead, Jon.\nYes.Q.I'm sure you saw the exchange between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris——\nI did.\nWell, first of all, before I get into that, I thought that she was given too much credit. He didn't do well, certainly, and maybe the facts weren't necessarily on his side. I think she was given too much credit for what she did. It wasn't that outstanding. And I think probably he was hit harder than he should've been hit, Biden. I thought he was hit actually harder.\nAnd as far as that, I will tell you in about 4 weeks, because we're coming out with certain policy that's going to be very interesting and very surprising, I think, to a lot of people.\nJennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], do you have a question?\nYou never know who's going to be tough. You never know. One that you think is going to be tough turns out to be not much. And sometimes, you think one—and I've seen it. Because, look, I had 17—we had, actually, a total of 18. A lot of people think 17. Governor of Virginia, remember? Add the Governor of Virginia. Wasn't there long—previous Governor.\nBut of the 18, you know, many were—all their lives, they wanted to be politicians. I never thought about being a politician until about 2 days before I decided to run. A little before that, but not too much before.\nAnd they—you know, you looked at some of them, they're very talented. You look at their résumés, it's, like, great. And sometimes, the ones that I thought would be the toughest were not the toughest at all. I mean, I could write a book. I should write a book.\nBut some of the people that I did in the Republican—because we had sort of a similar thing. We had 18 instead of—I guess they have 24 or 25. But some of the ones that I thought would be absolutely—absolutely, without question, the toughest, turned out—I didn't think they were tough at all. Others that a lot of people said weren't tough, they were tougher.\nI think she was given far too much credit for what she did. That was so out of the can, what she said. That thing was right out of a box. And I thought that he didn't respond great. I wouldn't say it was—this was not Winston Churchill we're dealing with, okay? But, I don't think, nearly as bad as they portended it to be.\nJennifer, go ahead.\nThank you.\nSure.\nOkay, so Turkey is an interesting case—because there's another one, Jim, that I get along with very well, and he's a tough cookie, okay? Right? President Erdogan. He's tough, but I get along with him. And maybe that's a bad thing, but I think it's a really good thing. Because, frankly, he wanted to wipe out—he has a big problem with the Kurds, as everyone knows. And he had a 65,000-man army at the border, and he was going to wipe out the Kurds, who helped us with ISIS. We took out the caliphate. We have a hundred percent of the caliphate.\nAnd I called him and I asked him not to do it. They are, I guess, natural enemies of his or Turkey's. And he hasn't done it. He had—they were lined up to go out and wipe out the people that we just defeated the ISIS caliphate with, and I said, \"You can't do that.\" You can't do it. And he didn't do it.\nSo I have a relationship. But let me tell you—so he goes out during the Obama administration; he wants to buy our Patriot missile. Right? They wouldn't sell it to him. He wants to buy—even though he's a member of NATO, and, in theory, he could be an ally if he respected the President. He—and he's got a big army, and he's—you know, they're fighters. Turkey is—big fighters. And we're working on Idlib Province together, because he doesn't want to see 3 million people killed, and neither do I—in Syria. But—and I mentioned that. That was another thing I mentioned, folks, to President Putin. I said, \"Please, take it easy with Idlib.\" Because, you know, they've been encircling that.\nI think if I didn't put out a statement 6 months ago, that would've been catastrophic. But they have 30,000 terrorists in Idlib Province. You have 3 million people. And you know, getting terrorists is okay, but you don't want to kill 3 million people or a million people to get the terrorists.\nSo anyway—so we get along great. But what happened with Turkey—and I will tell you when it's fair and when it's not fair. He wanted to buy the Patriot missile. President Obama's group said no. He kept wanting to buy it. They kept saying no, no, no. Couldn't buy it. Now, he needed it for defense. He needed it. So he then went to Russia, and he bought the S-400. Made a deal to buy it, because he couldn't get it. They wouldn't allow him to buy it. They wouldn't allow it. This administration, meaning this administration previous to mine, would not let him buy it.\nSo he goes out, he goes to Russia, and he makes a deal for the S-400. And let's assume it's not nearly as good, but he made a deal. He paid them money, a lot of money. Put up a lot of money. And he bought it. As soon as he bought it, people went back to him, from our country, and they said, \"Listen, we don't want you to use that system,\" because it's not the NATO system, et cetera, et cetera—you know all the reasons: \"We don't want you to use that system. Do us a favor, we'll sell you the Patriot.\" He said, \"It's too late. I already bought it.\" There was nothing he could do; he already bought it.\nIn the meantime, he bought over a hundred F-35s, the greatest fighter jet in the world. It's stealth. You can't see it. It's real hard to beat something when you can't see it. But he bought over a hundred. I think he bought 116. But he bought over a hundred. A lot. And he has options for more. And now he wants delivery. He's paid a tremendous amount of money, up front to Lockheed, our company, our jobs, everything. And now they're saying he's using the S-400 system, which is incompatible with our system, and if you use the S-400 system, Russia and other people can gain access into the genius of the F-35.\nBut honestly, I'm all for our country, but he got treated very unfairly. He was told you can't buy it, you can't buy it. You know, it's the old secret when you can't have something, all of a sudden, he ends up going and getting something else, and then they were—they said—first they said: \"We'll sell it to you. You can have it in 4 years.\" Then, they said, \"We'll get it to you immediately.\" But he said: \"I can't do it. I bought. I've spent a fortune on buying another system\"—similar system—from Russia. The problem is, he already bought the planes. And the planes aren't compatible from our standpoint. Not from the standpoint of compatibility, but from our standpoint, national security wise.\nSo it's a mess. It's a mess. And honestly, it's not really Erdogan's fault. So now we have breaking news.\n\"Donald Trump loves Turkey. He loves Turkey. Donald Trump is on the side of Turkey instead of the United\"——\nNo, I'm not.\nTurkey-U.S. Relations\nI love our country, but I have to tell you, President Erdogan, who has done—he gave me our pastor back, Pastor Brunson. Nobody else could get him back. Remember? They couldn't get him back. President Obama, he was in jail for 35 years. He was going to be in jail forever. Pastor Brunson, he was an innocent man.\nI called him. And after a very short period of time, Pastor Brunson was standing in the Oval Office, with me. And he was back. So you know, he's been—from my standpoint—and he's a tough guy. Okay? When you talk about tough. He's tough. But I get along with him.\nI think he was unfairly treated, where you were told you can't have it, and then after he bought another system, we were said—we said: \"We'll sell it to you. We'll give it to you right away.\" But he couldn't use it then. But by that time, he had already bought the plane.\nSo it's a complicated deal. We're working on it. We'll see what we can do.\nYes, go. Please.\nNo, we agreed—on China, this is actually a good question. I did agree to allow our companies—you know, it's jobs—I like our companies selling things to other people. So I allowed that to happen. Very complex things. Not easy. This is not things that are easy to make. Very few companies are able to do it. But a tremendous amount of money. Our companies were very upset. You know, these companies are great companies. You know all of them. But they weren't exactly happy with it. But we're allowing that because that was a national security; we're allowing them to sell.\nBut we agreed to leave that till the end. Huawei is a complicated situation. We agreed to leave that—we're leaving Huawei toward the end. We're going to see. We'll see where we go with the trade agreement.\nYes, please.\nWell, it has been something that they've done for a long period of time. I mean, you know, there aren't that many ways you're going to get people to schools. So this is something that's been done. In some cases, it's been done with a hammer instead of velvet glove. And you know, that's part of it.\nBut this has been certainly a thing that's been used over the—I think if Vice President Biden had answered the question somewhat differently, it would've been a lot—it would've been a different result. Because they really did hit him hard on that one. So—but it is certainly a primary method of getting people to schools.\nIt relates to everything we're doing. And you'll be hearing about it in—over the next couple of months.\nYes.\nNo, because we could do it in—we could do it—you know, I say to people—I used to say 45 minutes; I say 15. But we could do it quickly. We could do it in a day. We could do it in an hour. We could reform asylum very quickly. We could get rid of the loopholes very quickly. These are horrible loopholes.\nAnd the reason that Mexico is so good—because they do have very, very tough immigration. They don't have the kind of things and the kind of stupidity that we have. I mean, where somebody touches one foot on our sand and we now have to bring them into a court. We then have to register them. We then have to catch and release them. And they go, and they live in our country. Then they're supposed to come back in 3 years for a court case, and about 2 percent come back, very—as you know. I mean, you know it just as well as anybody, I really think. Maybe better than most.\nBut the fact is, they come back—but nobody comes back. Two percent come back. It's a horrible system. Now, what we're doing is, they come in illegally, and we're bringing them out legally. But at the request of some, you know, very good Democrats, they asked me if I could hold it. And I did for a couple of weeks. And we have a week left. But other than the fact that we did get, in a very bipartisan way, we got—and I appreciate Speaker Pelosi because she really worked with us. It was humanitarian money.\nI mean, they didn't have any money.\nAnd we're running—don't forget, nobody has ever had this problem before. We're running hospitals; we're running so many different things for the kids. And the kids are brought up because, under the laws, the kids are used—legally used—to get other people to come in.\nIf you have a child, it's much easier to come into our country. It's easy anyway. But if you have a child, it's much easier. So we have these kids who have been absolutely abused. Horribly abused. And we could stop that with a minor change in the law. It's a terrible thing that they're not doing it.\nSo here's what's happening. So I said, \"All right, let's see if you can give that to us.\" Now, in the meantime, we did—we just got it approved last night, so we have the $4½ billion in humanitarian aid. Right? And that's good. So we have that.\nBut we can have that number go way down if we stop people from coming up. For instance, if we had walls up and if we had it hard, the father and the beautiful daughter who drowned—and you know, the Rio Grande is a very tough—you know, that has moments where it can be very calm, and then all of a sudden, it becomes totally violent, and people get swept away.\nBut if they thought it was hard to get in, they wouldn't be coming up. They wouldn't be coming up. And so many lives would be saved.\nSo, essentially, if they would change the laws—and I said, \"It would take us an hour, but let's give you 2 weeks.\" At the end of the second week, we'll be removing people—legally removing. In other words——\nOh, yes. Unless we do something pretty miraculous. But the Democrats, it seems to me, they want to have open borders. And for the life of me, I cannot figure that out. It's one thing, because I want people to come into our country. We need them, because we have all these companies coming in. You know, we have Foxconn in Wisconsin. We have so many companies coming in. Auto companies. Just today I was with President Abe; he told me another auto company is going to build a big plant. They need people. So I'm all for that.\nThe only problem is that they have to come in through a process. They have to come in legally. It's also very unfair. You have millions of people on line for years trying to get into a country. They take tests. They study. They know a lot about our country. They read. They do—they have to go through a very complicated process. And these people have worked hard. They've been on line for 7, 8, 9 years, and then somebody walks in, and they're, you know, \"Welcome to the United States.\" It's really—honestly, it's very unfair.\nBut yes, we will be removing large numbers of people. People have to understand: Yes, the laws are—Q.In a week?\nYes. Starting in a week, after—you know, sometime after July 4.\nWell, that's different. That's humanitarian—no, that's a different—that's humanitarian. We needed that just to take care—because we're running now hospitals. I mean, the Border Patrol—these are incredible people—they're doing what they—you know, nobody ever thought they were going to be doing this.\nAnd people are coming up—the reason people are coming up is because we're doing so well as a country. In past years, we weren't doing well. In past years, Mexico was doing better. You know, they took 32 percent of our car business. They were doing better than we were doing in the past. Now we're the hot country in the world, and people are coming up because they want a piece of that action.\nAnd the other reason children are coming up is because we had a separation policy. Okay? Under President Obama, we had separation. President Obama built those cells. They were in 2014. They were built. They all said, \"Oh, look how horrible.\" Then, it turned out that it was built by President Obama. And I'm not blaming anybody. I'm not blaming him.\nI just say this: They had a separation policy. Right? I ended it. But when I ended it, I put out a statement: I think it's going to bring more children up because you're ending it. You're saying now the child can stay with the parent. So I said, ending it is nice in one way, but in terms of what we're doing, it makes it even tougher.\nBut the really bad thing is the cartels—and I really think that Mexico—because, you know, they did 6,000; now they're doing 16,000 on our border—I think that Mexico is looking to swamp the cartels. And those kind of numbers will do it. It would be a great thing. What Mexico is doing for us is great.\nBy the way, without the tariffs, they wouldn't have done it, folks. We've been after—we've been after them for many years to do it.\nBut they have really, so far—it's only a week—the numbers are way down. And, so far, a lot of good things have happened.\nYes, sir. Please. Yes, please. In the second row.\nWould you like me to leave now or? Here's the thing: I can stay—we can do this for a long time. My only problem is this: I don't need stories, \"He stayed up there too long.\" If I stay up there quickly, they say, \"Why did he not give us more time?\" If I stay up for 2 hours, they'll say, \"He stayed up too long.\"\nI mean, if you promise you're not going to say—I say because everybody has got a hand up, and if you want, I'll go on. Should I go on, or should I not go on? What you do you think?\nOkay, and you're not going to say, \"He went on too long?\"\nDisproportionately, absolutely.\nOh, I had many—oh, yes, I have—I'll bet I have 50 alternatives. I have many alternatives. Yes. I mean, you don't know what the sites were. You said \"oil rig.\" You don't know what the sites were. But I had many alternatives. No, no, military leaders did a great job.\nWhen we chose and designated certain areas that we were thinking about, I said, \"How many people are going to die?\" I mean, I'm talking about on the other side. That means a lot to me too, okay? \"How many people are going to die?\" They said, \"Probably about 150.\" You don't know, could be much worse than that. Could be less too, I guess, but it could be much more than that, because this is heavy stuff going in.\nAnd we would have been a hundred percent—we have the greatest military in the world. I deal with them all the time. These people are incredible people. Lethal. And hopefully, we don't have to use it much.\nI mean, we've spent—if you look at the numbers—$716 billion this year. We had planes that were so old that we didn't—now we have brandnew F-35s. We have brandnew Super Hornets and F-18s and—I mean, the equipment we have is incredible.\nThe Army now has beautiful new things. Everything is—we have a military that's really great. Hopefully, we don't have to use it very much.\nBut no, they came in, they said this, and I asked them a question. And they came back a short time later and they said, \"About 150 people.\" I said: \"That's really disproportionate. I don't like it.\"\nWell, I have had a lot of countries come up to me. France has come up. If you look at President Macron—good guy—he came up to me. He said, \"You know, I do a lot of business\"—meaning, France does a lot of business with Iran.\nI would love to go see them. It's all right. Anybody can see them. I don't mind talking. I think talking is great. I'm not going to say: \"Oh, don't talk to them. Don't talk to them.\"\nI do think John Kerry should not have been talking to them. I think that's delaying this process a lot. I think he violated the Logan Act, actually. But I think John Kerry, speaking to Iran a lot, maybe saying things like: \"Gee, you know, if you wait another 15 months, maybe Trump will lose the election, and then you can deal with a person that's a lot easier than Trump. You'll deal with a stiff that will give you everything you want.\" And that makes it a little tougher for me to make a deal, but that's okay.\nYes, please. Go.\nYes, I think it's very unfortunate.\nWell, we're looking at that legally, because they're asking us to do a census. And you know, the census—it was shocking to me. I figured it would be, you know, not expensive to do a census. It's billions of dollars. You know that, right? Billions. Billions.\nThey go knock on doors of every house in the country, and they get everything. They're not allowed to ask whether or not somebody is a citizen of the United States? How horrible and ridiculous is that?\nSo we are looking at that. Yes. Sure.\nBecause it wasn't a real decision that, \"Boom, this is the way it is.\" It was like, \"Now.\" Right? \"Now.\"\nIt depends on what happens, I guess. It was a very strange decision. It was a very, very sad decision. Not in terms of voting. Not in terms of—just a very sad, because it was so convoluted. It was—to get to that decision, had to be very, very hard.\nHey, who's really playing politics, okay? Check it out. You tell me who's playing politics.\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nYou're?\nNo. I just——\nWe talked about it. Hey, we talked about it. You know we've talked about it before. You know he denies it totally, by the way. Just to—I mean, how many times can you get somebody to deny something? But he has, in the past, denied it. He's denied it also publicly.\nBut we talked about it. We talked about a lot of other things. I tell you, we talked about something that I think is very important, and that's putting a cap on what he's buying and we're buying, from a nuclear standpoint—and other—arms control. We talked a lot about arms control. And I think he'd like to see arms control, and so would we. I think it makes a lot of sense.\nYes, go ahead.\n——good report. I mean, it was a good report.\nI had 18 people that hated me. I had Mueller who was totally conflicted and, obviously, didn't like me. We had—he was totally conflicted. And yet no obstruction, no collusion. And you know, that was good report.\nYes, please.\nAnd you know, the Democrats want a do-over or five. They want to get it right. They're working to get it right. They want a do-over or five.\nYes, please.\nWell, they are a very important part of it, but they don't really have to be. We're just getting started.\nWe have—and, as you know, we have a very good—David Friedman, a great gentleman. One of the most successful lawyers in New York, who loves Israel—David Friedman. Jason Greenblatt, who worked for me and my company, great, great lawyer. Great talent. Jared Kushner. And with me being President, if you don't get that deal done it, will never happen. We'll have to see what happens.\nBut I think the Palestinians basically—I'm not sure—I know they want to make a deal, but they want to be a little bit cute, and that's okay. I fully understand where they're coming from.\nAs you know, I've ended the money to—that was—we were paying them $550 million a year, and I ended that money because a year ago, I heard they were saying nasty things. I said: \"Wait a minute. We're trying to make a deal. We're trying to help them and they're saying these nasty things? We're not going to pay.\"\nNow, if a deal is made, we would go back on a humanitarian basis. Not so different from the border. Because you see the problems and what's going on. It's terrible. But I think we have a very good chance of making a deal, and a lot of people think that's probably the toughest deal of all. And it may very well be the toughest deal of all. A lot of people think it can't be made. I mean, over the years, a lot of people would say, \"That's a deal that can't be made no matter what.\"\nBut you know, hey, I like to—we're going to try. But I really believe that—I went to other negotiators from past years. For many, many years they've been trying to make this deal. And I said, \"Did you ever take the money away?\" Because they were always very hostile. And they said: \"No, we wouldn't do that. That's inappropriate.\" \"Why is it inappropriate? I mean, they're saying bad things. Why is it inappropriate?\"\nAnd what I've done is said, \"Look, as long—if you're not negotiating and if you don't want to make peace, we're not going to pay you.\" So let's see what happens.\nI think they want to make a deal, and I've had a very good relationship with some of their leaders. And obviously I've had a good relationship with Israel.\nNow, the transaction was thrown up in the air a little bit because of what happened with Bibi Netanyahu's election. They thought he won, and then, all of a sudden, they couldn't put together the coalition. And now they're back to campaigning again. So that was something that came up that—who would have expected that. Maybe something will happen faster, but you know, that's going to be going on for about 3 months.\nThere's a good chance we could—there's a chance. I don't want to even say \"good chance\" on that one because people say it's the hardest deal. I've heard—when I was young, I'd say, \"What do you think of this?\" They'd say, \"Oh, that's tougher than Israel and the Palestinians making a deal.\" They used to use that as, like, the metaphor. They used to use that as the excuse for a deal that was very tough to make. So it's probably about the toughest deal to make.\nI actually think that there's a good chance.\nYes, sir. Please, go ahead. Yes. White shirt. No, the gentleman behind you. Yes. Okay, go ahead.\nWe'll get to you.\nGo ahead. That's the man I'm looking at.\nSure.\nNo, not at all. No, no. We're going to be talking about Huawei, but we are going to be supplying equipment from our companies. Our companies make billions and billions of dollars' worth of equipment. But we are not discussing Huawei with President Xi yet. I want to see—before we start getting into that, I want to see where we end up. We have to——\nWe have a national security problem, which to me is paramount. Very important.\nIt goes without—I think that goes without saying. I mean, look what I've done. Look what—who's done what I've done? I took ZTE off, if you remember. I was the one; I did that. That was a personal deal. And then, President Xi called me. And he asked me for a personal favor, which I considered to be very important. He's a leader of a major country. And it was very important to him, having to do with where the employees are located and his relationship to that area. And it was 85,000 employees. And they were almost out of business. And he agreed to pay a $1.2 billion penalty and some other things, including a board change and including some management changes, et cetera. The ZTE, which is a—you know, much smaller than Huawei, but it's very big. And they paid us a billion-two. $1.2 billion.\nI mean, part of the problem is then the Democrats go out and say—if I got $200 trillion, they'd say: \"This was terrible. What a terrible deal.\" Because that's the way politics is. It's, sort of, sad.\nBut you know, we got $1.2 billion. And we closed it; we opened it. And we had certain changes made, as you know. They made changes to the board. They changed the board. They made management changes. And they paid a lot of money. And they also have to buy American product. Buying American product is very important to me. It's a big thing.\nYes. Go ahead, blue. Blue shirt.\nAre we going to continue onward?\nYes?\nDoes anybody say \"no\"? Huh?\nWe just left Angela.\nShe's another friend of mine. People don't think so.\nWe have a great relationship. I hope you know that.Q.Since we will not forget that.\nWe spent a lot of time together too.\nI don't ignore it. So we have the best numbers that we've ever had recently. And I'm not looking to put our companies out of business. I'm not looking to create a standard that is so high that we're going to lose 20, 25 percent of our production. I'm not willing to do that. We have the cleanest water we've ever had. We have the cleanest air. You saw the reports come out recently. We have the cleanest air we've ever had. But I'm not willing to sacrifice the tremendous power of what we've built up over a long period of time and what I've enhanced and revived. I'm not—I'm just not willing to do that.\nAnd they understand where I stand. And you know, I'm not necessarily sure I agree. I can tell you, I'm not sure that I agree with certain countries, what they're doing. Because I think they're losing a lot of the power of what they can do with factories and with—and I'm not talking about political power, although that comes with it—I'm talking about the powering of a plant. It doesn't always work with a windmill. When the wind goes off, the plant isn't working. It doesn't always work with solar, because solar is just not strong enough.\nAnd a lot of them want to go to wind, which has caused a lot of problems. And you know, the problem with wind is, in the United States, we're subsidizing these wind towers all over the place, because wind doesn't work—for the most part, doesn't work without subsidy. And I don't want to be subsidizing things that don't have to be subsidized.\nThe United States is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't want to do that.\nWe'll take a few more. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nOne.\nPick the better one, please.\nYou'll see.\nThat's all I can do. That's all I can do. No. But that's all I can do.\nI can only say, \"You'll see.\" We cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. Just can't do it.\nYes.\nWell, first of all, we're following Venezuela very closely. It's a catastrophe. It's what socialism can do. I use it all the time. I mean, it's what socialism can do. It was one of the richest countries 20 years ago. It's got among the largest oil reserves in the world. And they don't have food. They don't have water. It's really, actually, incredible. I discussed it with—I've discussed it with almost every leader this weekend. We discuss Venezuela, because we don't ever want that to happen to us or their countries.\nOkay, go ahead.\nOh, sure, it takes time.\nThe problem is, so many people leaving Venezuela; it's, like, going to be a ghost town. It's a very bad thing that's happening in Venezuela. Nobody has seen anything quite like it, actually—especially from the standpoint that they were so wealthy.\nThey've gone—I know so many people from Venezuela living in Miami. They're incredible people. They're incredible, incredible—a lot of them live in Doral, Miami. It's—they call it \"Little Venezuela.\" I know them so well. These are people that are hard workers, warm. They're just incredible. And to see what's happening to Venezuela is heartbreaking. It's really heartbreaking.\nSure. You have a lot of strategies. I have five different strategies. I could change any moment.\nBut, in the meantime, we're helping them from the standpoint of aid. We're getting as much aid as we can. I think they're making a big mistake, because they're not making the aid very easy, as you know. You know, they're not making it easy to get to people. But people are starving to death, and their water—they have no water. They have no water. They have oil, but they don't have any water.\nNo, we have a lot of things in store if we have to do that. We don't want to do anything but—you know, we don't want to get involved to the extent that you may be thinking. But we have a lot of alternatives. We have five different alternatives for Venezuela. And we'll see what happens. It's doing very poorly. And Maduro is doing very poorly, obviously. It's not—it's just not working. Just not working.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead.\nQuestion. Question. Question.\nI asked, yes.\nI asked him what was happening, and he was telling me that—I think he said 13, but could be more—and I think he said more in the works—that there are large numbers of people being prosecuted. He's very angry about it. He's very unhappy about it.\nAnd I did mention it to him very strongly, and he answered very strongly. But they're prosecuting large numbers of people. That was a bad event.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nI cannot comment on intelligence community. I just—I'm not—probably, I guess I'm allowed to do what I want to do in terms of that, right? We can declassify, unlike Hillary Clinton. She decided to just give it out. We can declassify. The truth is that I just don't want to talk about intelligence.\nBut I will say this: A lot of people are being prosecuted, and they're taking it very seriously over there. And they've done a great job in Saudi Arabia from the standpoint of women and from—a lot of different things are happening in Saudi Arabia.\nOne of the other things—very important with Saudi Arabia: that not only are they an ally, not only have they spent tremendous amounts of money coming into our country—and they have been a good ally, and they have actually bought tremendous amounts of military equipment that we use and that we're able to use—but they're also very much now changed their ways as to financing terror, which I can't say for a lot of other countries.\nIf you look at Iran, if you look at other countries in that area, they're financing terror. Now, it's harder for Iran because Iran doesn't have the money they used to have. And they were given $150 billion. They were given $1.8 billion in cash. But Saudi Arabia has come a long way. I'll tell you, in terms of reform, Saudi Arabia really has come a long way.\nYes, please—in the gold. Yes, you. Right.\nI don't want to talk about it now. I mean, we're looking at that very carefully. Huawei is very much in play, in terms of our country and in terms of intelligence and the intelligence community. We know a lot about Huawei. But I don't want to mention that right now. I just think it's inappropriate.\nI will say that we're not making it—other than what I told you already, we're not making it a big subject. We're going to save that for later. Okay?\nChina-U.S. Trade\nNo. I think we're going to be strategic partners.\nI think we can help each other. I think, in the end, we can—if the right deal is structured, we can be great for each other.\nIf China would open up—you're opening up a tremendous—you know, the largest market in the world. And right now China is not open to the United States, but we're open to China. That should have never really been allowed to happen.\nYes.\nWell, I haven't heard him say that. But he did invite me to Russia for the defeat of Nazis—that's a big thing—defeat of Nazis. You know, Russia lost, he said, 25 million people. I had actually heard 50 million people. But he said yesterday that Russia, fighting the Nazis, they lost 25 million people. You would know better than anybody, Peter [Peter Baker, New York Times].\nBut it was a tremendous—you know, they suffered greatly. And they're having a 75th, you could really say, celebration of the defeat of the Nazis. And he invited me, and I said I would give it very serious consideration. That was a—Russia went through a lot. They lost, I guess, far more than anybody, fighting the Nazis, in terms of people. And he did invite me, and I said we would get back. But we will give that very serious consideration.\nOkay?

{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Moon Jae-in of South Korea in Seoul, South Korea", "Date": "2019-06-30", "Text": "Thank you very much. I'm just going to make a very short statement, because we're going to the DMZ border, and I'll be meeting with Chairman Kim. I look forward to it very much. I look forward to seeing him. We've developed a very good relationship. And we understand each other. I do believe he understands me, and I think I maybe understand him. And sometimes, that can lead to very good things.\nI want to start by just thanking President Moon and, very importantly, First Lady Moon, who's a very special woman, a very special spirit. She loves your country very much, as does President Moon. And we had a great dinner last night, together, and spent a large part of the morning discussing lots of different things, including trade and military, frankly, and many other items.\nBut I thought I would just mention that when we came here, our great Ambassador—we arrived last night—our great Ambassador, who's here someplace—Harry—was talking about the turmoil going on because of the level of—it was the vitriol. A level of vitriol that was happening between North and South. But it was North, to a large extent, where there was a lot of risk and a lot of threat, and a lot of bad things were happening. That was before I became President.\nAnd as you know—and the media knows very well because they covered it, frankly, very well and very fairly—at the beginning, there was a lot of anger between myself and Kim Jong Un, who since—something happened. There was a point at which it happened, and all of a sudden, we get along.\nAnd I figured that when I was in Japan, where they hosted a fantastic G-20—and I want to just thank Prime Minister Abe because he really—they did a fantastic job, and a lot of good things came out of that. A lot of good meetings with other countries, I can tell you, from the standpoint of the United States. But we decided to come here a while ago, as part of going to the G-20; I promised President Moon. And then, yesterday I was just thinking: \"Hey, I'm here. Let's see whether or not we can say hello to Kim Jong Un.\" And I put out the word, and he got back, and he wanted to do it from the beginning, and so did I.\nBut there's a lot of good feeling. You know, when sometimes the media will say, \"Gee, what's happened?\" Well, they know what's happened. What's happened is, there was nuclear testing, there was ballistic missile testing. They had hostages of ours, as you know. Very tough situation. And now we're getting back our remains. We got back the hostages. There's been no ballistic missile tests. And there's been no nuclear tests.\nAnd South Korea is a whole different place. And Japan. Prime Minister Abe was telling me Japan is a whole different place. They had missiles going over Japan on a very constant basis. You know that very well.\nSo I hate to hear the media, you know, give false information to the public when they say, \"Oh, what's been done?\" What's been done? A lot has been done. And there's also a good feeling. I can tell you, on behalf of President Moon, he feels much better about even Chairman Kim. I mean, he feels much better.\nThey couldn't have meetings. Nobody was going to meet. President Obama wanted to meet, and Chairman Kim would not meet him. The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were begging for meetings constantly. And Chairman Kim would not meet with him.\nAnd for some reason, we have a certain chemistry or whatever. Now, let's see what happens. We have a long way to go. But I'm in no rush. The sanctions are on, and I'm in no rush. I'm in no rush with Iran. I'm never in a rush. If you're in a rush, you get yourself in trouble.\nSo I just want to say that we're going to be heading out to the DMZ, and it's something I planned long ago, but had the idea yesterday to maybe say hello, just shake hands quickly and say hello, because we haven't seen each other since Vietnam. We had a great meeting in Vietnam. People don't realize it. We had a—it's all part of the whole negotiation. But we had actually a great meeting in Vietnam. We had a great meeting in Singapore. Everyone gave us praise for Singapore and not for Vietnam. I think, frankly, the meeting in Vietnam, in terms of a deal, was more important than Singapore.\nSo I think what I'd like to do is, we'll take one or two questions, as I understand it. And then, I'm going to head out to the DMZ and pay my respects to everybody, including some soldiers. We have some—we have tremendous military here in South Korea, and we're going to see some of our great American soldiers. We'll be talking to them. And I'll be seeing Kim Jong Un.\nAnd if you would, you could start with a question. Thank you.\nThank you. [Laughter] Thank you. She's learned very well. [Laughter] Thank you very much, Stephanie. I appreciate it.\nJust to add one thing to your question from CBS: It's just a step. It might be an important step, and it might not. But what we're doing today is a step. And probably, it's a step in the right direction. There's a good feeling, so it could be very good.\nAs far as another meeting, I think let's see what happens today before we start thinking about that. But it could be very important.\nLet's see, a question? Yes. Next time. Go ahead. Next time.\nNorth Korea/China-U.S. Trade Relations Q.Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Mr. President. Margaret Talev with Bloomberg News. I hope you'll indulge me. Since we get one question, I'm going to try to make it count. Why do you want to step into North Korea and what do you think that handshake could actually accomplish? Nothing has substantively changed since Hanoi. North Korea has tested short-range missiles. Why does Kim Jong Un deserve this moment?\nAnd how do you respond to the critics who say it's nothing more than a photo op or that you're legitimizing a nuclear state?\nI also, quickly, need to get in one China clarification, which is: Your agreement with President Xi as of yesterday, does that bring you back to the point in April where they had made a lot of concessions on IP and that sort of stuff? Or are you back at November, back at the beginning of the process?\n——two very distinct questions. Hold it. Before you do a third——\nI know. You'll do that in a second.\nNo, we've made tremendous strides. Only the fake news says that they weren't. If you look again—I don't have to repeat it—but if you look again at where we were 2½ years ago, I think I can say, the hatred that everybody had for everybody and where it was going.\nAnd I said that if President Obama's term was, for some reason, extended through any method, including having a successor that thought the way that that administration thought, you would be right now at war with North Korea. And it wouldn't be pretty. It would be tough.\nWe have the greatest military in the world, by far. We have a much greater military now than we had 2½ years ago, as you know very well. You reported on it. We bought tremendous equipment, from jets, to ships, to equipment for soldiers.\nBut we are in a much different place right now, Margaret, than we were 2½ years ago. Much different. And the previous administration wanted to talk. I would ask people, \"Why aren't they talking?\" And not everything happens with talks. Some bad things happen with talk too. But in this case, we are so far advanced from where we were 2½ years ago that it's always insulting. And I think it's why the press, frankly, has lost such credibility. They've lost such credibility.\nBut to think that we're comparing where we are now to 2½ years ago is—in a way it's insulting, but we're doing well. Let's see what happens in the end. But we're doing well. A big difference.\nAnd as far as China is concerned, we are where we are. We're collecting 25 percent on $250 billion, and China is paying for it, as you know, because, as you notice, our inflation hasn't gone up. China has devalued their currency in order to pay for the tariffs.\nAnd in addition to devaluing, they've also pumped a lot of money into their economic model. They've been pumping money in. We haven't. We've been retracting. We've been raising interest rates, and they've been lowering interest rates.\nSo we're not playing on a fair field. The Fed has not been of help to us at all. And despite that, we're winning, and we're winning big because we have created an economy that is second to none. Greatest in the world. And one of the things that happened at the G-20—in fact, the President came up and said the same thing to me—President Moon: \"Congratulations on the economy. What's happened in the last 2½ years is incredible. It's incredible.\"\nIf the other thought process would have won the election, we would have—instead of being up 3 percent, we would have been down 5 percent, in my opinion. And I think you would have had a stock market crash, because we were heading in that direction. It would have been very, very ugly.\nAnd just to complete: You have to value the stock market from the day after I won, because there was a tremendous surge after I won: because of the fact I won; because people want that thinking instead of the thinking that we had. If I hadn't won, right after the election, on November 9, you would have had a tremendous decrease in the stock market.\nSo I noticed that the previous administration was given credit for thousands of points of gain right after the election. No. It went up because I won, and we'll take the credit. And if you take that credit, we've increased the stock market values by more than 50 percent. You have to take that credit. It went up only because I won. And it went up a lot between election day and, you know, when we ultimately took office. And from there it went up a lot. It continues to go up a lot, and now we're setting records virtually every day.\nAnd just to conclude on China: President Xi and I had a fantastic meeting. It was a great meeting. We get along. We also have a really, really good relationship. And he wants to see something happen, and so would I. And I think there's a really good chance of that happening. We had a great meeting. Thank you.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-moon-jae-south-korea-seoul-south-korea-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Joe Kerken of CNBC", "Date": "2019-07-20", "Text": "Thank you, Joe.\nThat's right, which we have to do.\nIvanka is very much involved, and she's been involved. We have tremendous numbers of people who really are phenomenal in every way, but they're not trained, and they're not qualified to take some of the jobs. You report on it all of the time. All of the companies that are pouring back into our country. So we have Chrysler... we have so many companies. And we have companies expanding. Look at what's happening with Apple, where they're going to be spending $350 billion, and I can go on and on. And we need people with skill. We need people who are trained. It's much different than it was 30 years ago and 40 years ago. We need people that can go out there and do it, and that's exactly what we're doing. And in front of you is a list that's going to create almost 4 million jobs. These are a list of companies. They'll be creating a tremendous number of jobs, and they're going to be skill jobs. And these are people that will be trained, really trained and trained well.\nThat is right. Training, and if you look at the companies, those are the great companies—\nAbsolutely. Walmart, so many great companies. They're going to be here at three o'clock today. They'll be, they're going to be having a big conference, everybody's here. And we're talking about almost 4 million jobs.\nNo, but I think it's maybe as good as it's ever been ever. I mean companies… What I really am happy about is, a lot of cash is coming back in through the billions and trillions of dollars as you know that was overseas where companies were locked and they couldn't get it back. Now it's coming back hundreds of millions of dollars at a clip, and also, companies are coming back to our country. We have record numbers of companies coming back in, they're coming back—they're pouring back in. And they're going to Michigan, and they're going to Ohio and Pennsylvania and so many different states. And people can't believe what's happening, we're really doing well.\nI put a very good man in the Fed. I don't necessarily agree with it because he's raising interest rates, I'm not saying I agree with it, and I don't necessarily agree with it, I must tell you I don't. I'm not thrilled because we go up and every time you go up, they want to raise rates again. I don't really - I'm not happy about it. But at the same time I'm letting them do what they feel is best. But I don't like all of this work that goes into doing what we're doing you look at the Euro, you look at what's going on with the EU and they are not doing what we are doing and we already have somewhat of a disadvantage although I am turning that into an advantage. You know last year and for years we have been losing $150 billion dollars with the EU nations with the European union and they are making money easy and their currency is falling. In China their currency is dropping like a rock and our currency is going up and I have to tell you it puts us at a disadvantage. Now I'm just saying the same thing that I would have said as a private citizen. So somebody would say, Oh, maybe you shouldn't say that as a President. I couldn't care less what they say because my views haven't changed. I don't like all this work that we are putting in to the economy and then I see rates going up, I see China where, I mean look at what's happening with their currency, it is dropping like a rock.\nWell it's also because I think I'm helping, OK. You want to know the truth, because I'm doing something, we're going to you know, we're going to level out the playing field.\nRight.\nThis is the time.\nThis is the time.\nYou know the expression \"We're playing with the bank's money,\" right? We're up almost 40%.\nSo Joe I could have a much easier life if I wanted to do it incorrectly. It would be much easier for me. Sitting here I could just let all of these countries continue onward with these massive deficits. I mean, honestly, I don't want to use the word because it's a highly-respected show, but they are taking advantage of us ok? I'll use a different set of words. They are taking advantage of us.\nI know, but it's not as good as the other word. You know what the other word is.\nWe are being taken advantage of and I don't like it. And I haven't liked it for many years. China, with China, $507 billion a year in deficits. With the EU $151 billion. With Mexico, $120 billion. Mexico. Who would think Mexico? Mexico's making a fortune. Plus they have a tax, we don't have a tax. They have a tax on top of that, and the tax is almost 17%. A VAT tax. And you look, I could go through every country. I could talk about Japan, I could talk about – they're very good allies, but no wonder they're good. I mean, their deficits, the money they're making off the United States. Now, I would have a higher stock market right now, it's already up almost 40%, as you know, since the election. It could be 80% if I didn't want to do this, but ultimately, what I'm doing is making it so it's right.\nAnd we'll also start cutting expenses, by the way.\nTremendous hope.\n100%.\nHe should.\nYeah. I don't want them to be scared. I want them to do well. I really like President Xi a lot, but it was very unfair, so I raised 50. We're down 500. Now some people would say $375 billion. I'm not talking about million. I'm not talking about pennies. I'm talking about – we're down $375 billion, but other estimates could say 507, it doesn't matter. So it's in between there, or it's there. We're down a tremendous amount. I raised 50, and they matched us. I said, \"You don't match us. You can't match us because otherwise we're always going to be behind the 8-ball.\"\nI'm ready to go to 500.\nWell, I actually think that's – well, if it does, it does. Look, I'm not doing this for politics.\nI'm doing this to do this right thing for our country. We have been ripped off by China for a long time and I told that to President Xi. I said, \"How did this ever happen?\" And you know what their answer is? Because I deal with the highest echelons of China. One of the great people of China said, \"There was never anybody to talk to in the United States. We would put on a trade barrier, where you couldn't sell cars, or you couldn't sell beef, or you couldn't sell your farm products. We would put it on, and nobody would talk to us in the United States, so we said, ‘Hey, that's great!' Then we'd put on another one. We'd put on a tariff on cars – 25% - and you'd charge us virtually nothing – 2.5%. But they don't pay it. So we would do this and nobody would talk. We'd start off at a lower number. We'd raise it, we'd raise it. Nobody would ever complain until you came along.\" Me. And they said, \"Now you're doing more than complaining. We don't like what you're doing.\" You know, they think I'm doing maybe too much, but of course they're going to think that. But for many years – and I'm not just saying Obama. I'm saying Bush, and I'm saying long before, they had nobody. And it's very interesting because I actually asked them the question, \"So we're down 507 – recently – we're down $507 billion in trade deficits. How did it happen?\" And they told me, \"Nobody ever complained. Nobody ever talked to us.\"\nYeah.\nWe – yeah, I would say it's in the works. Look, we had a tremendous discussion on many things: terrorism, Syria, the Middle East overall, Iran. We talked about, as an example, nuclear proliferation. There's nothing – to me, there's nothing more important than that. We had a tremendous meeting. We had a – I think it was a very good press conference. I mean, except for the fake news, I really think I did really well at the press conference. Hey –\nSecond meeting. Yeah.\nWe got along very well. Look, the fact is we got along very well. We, I think could do great things for his country, but for our country. I'm interested in our country. I'm also interested in the world. I'd like to see peace. And I think we could do great things for the world. I think we can do -- now, that includes China. That includes others. I'm doing very well, getting along with countries. Getting along is a good thing, not a bad thing. But, I think I'd have a good relationship with Putin.\nI do. I do.\nEven you, which is almost impossible, right?\nAnd by the way, that's good for everybody.\nRight.\nSure. Sure.\nNo. I have nothing to do with Russia. I never did.\nThat other deal is a big hoax. It's a hoax. It's a Russia…\n-- It's called the Democrat hoax. It's a big fat hoax. I have nothing to do with Russia. And I think you know that. You would know. You've known me for a very long time.\nYou think I'm dealing in Russia?\nYeah.\nSo I had a meeting that lasted for more than two hours. It wasn't always conciliatory in that meeting.\nNo, but we discussed many of the points I just said.\nI mean, basically that's what we discussed. We discussed lots of great things for both countries, frankly. But there are things that we can do for both countries that are very good. Now, we then go to a news conference. I mean I had these -- some of these fools from the media saying, \"Why didn't you stand there, look him in the face, walk over to him, and start shouting at him?\" I said, \"Are these people crazy? I want to make a deal.\" I want to make a deal. You can't do that. And we've been having a bad relationship with Russia for many years. And you know, that may be wrong. I -- it may be that you can't do anything and -- that's very possible. But I'm different than other president's. I'm a dealmaker. I've made deals all my life. I do really well. I make great deals. You know it because you've covered them for a long time Joe. And I think if we can get along with Russia and other countries….\nIt doesn't hurt, okay. It doesn't hurt.\nMaybe, in the computer. I mean maybe. It's -- probably doesn't hurt you know. But I'm not even looking at it that way. I'm just saying if we can do certain things on terrorism, as an example… we found out that in St. Petersburg a little more than a year a ago there was going to be a very major terrorist attack. St. Petersburg, Russia.\nWe called them and let them know. They were able to nab this very vicious gang of terrorists. They got them. I assume they're some place right now that maybe you don't even want to know about. I don't know what they did with them. Okay? And I don't care.\nThey thanked us profusely. This was gonna be a major attack. We found out about it and we gave them that information. That's a good thing. And Putin, called me up. President Putin called me up and he said \"I wanna thank you very much. That would've been a major attack in St. Petersburg.\" We informed them. I don't think anybody even knows about that. These are good things. They inform us. They can inform us. Getting along is a good thing, not a bad thing. The fake news they want to make it like where there's like a big confrontation. I don't want to play that game. I don't want to go into that game.\nWith that being said, I have been far tougher on Russia than any president in many, many years. Maybe ever. Even, even the big fight I have with Germany over the fact that they're taking natural gas –\nThey're taking energy from Russia. Paying them billions of dollars. I said, \"Wait a minute - we're supposed to be protecting you from Russia, and you're paying them billions of dollars. What's that all about?\" Now, do you think that's a positive for Russia? I'm talking them out of things that they – where they're giving billions of dollars. It's ridiculous, by the way, that that's happening. And then on top of that Germany pays a fraction of what they should be paying for defense. We're supposed to defend them. So they're paying Russia and we're supposed to defend them from Russia. So just - you just look at that point. But look at the sanctions I've put on. Look at the diplomats I threw out. Look at all of the things that I've done. Nobody else did what I've done. Obama didn't do it. Obama was a patsy for Russia. He was a total patsy. Look at the statement he made, when he thought the mics were turned off, okay? The stupid statement he made. Nobody does a big deal about that. Getting along with President Putin, getting along with Russia is a positive, not a negative.\nNow, with that being said, if that doesn't work out, I'll be the worst enemy he's ever had. The worst he's ever had.\nNo, no, no. I think – I think he knows that though.\nBut I think he knows that -- I'll be his worst nightmare. But I don't think it'll be that way. I actually think we'll have a good relationship.\n90%.\n90% think of it, the two countries.\nThank you very much.\nThank you. I appreciate it very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-joe-kerken-cnbc"}
{"Title": "Interview with Chuck Todd of NBC News", "Date": "2019-07-23", "Text": "Thank you.\nWell, you had a situation that was very bad because the night before, they shot down an unmanned drone. And the unmanned is a very big factor. The fact that there was not a person on it, a U.S. person on it, or anybody. And that had an impact on me. I said, \"Well, you know, we got a little problem.\" And I think they did that on purpose because they understand that they will be hit very hard if that were a plane with a person in it. And I think they knew that there was nobody there. So we had a very, you know, modest but pretty, pretty heavy attack schedule.\nOh, I have so many targets you wouldn't believe.\nWe have targets all over.\n-- things change, right?\nNo, no, no, no. But we had something ready to go, subject to my approval. And they came in. And they came in about a half an hour before, they said, \"So we're about ready to go.\" I said, \"I want a better definition --\"\nNo, no. \"We're about ready to go.\" No, but they would have been pretty soon. And things would have happened to a point where you wouldn't turn back or couldn't turn back. So they came and they said, \"Sir, we're ready to go. We'd like a decision.\" I said, \"I want to know something before you go. How many people will be killed, in this case Iranians?\" I said, \"How many people are going to be killed?\" \"Sir, I'd like get back to you on that,\" great people these generals. They said, came back, said, \"Sir, approximately 150.\" And I thought about it for a second and I said, \"You know what? They shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it. And here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead.\" And I didn't like it. I didn't think it was, I didn't think it was proportionate. Now that doesn't mean --\nI think the response should be -- Well, first of all, as you know, we've done very massive sanctions. We're increasing the sanctions now. But the response is always going to be very strong. I built up a lot of capital. I've had a lot of people that aren't Trump fans saying, \"I can't believe.\" You know, a lot of them said, \"We're going to be in World War III the first week.\" Didn't work out that way. We're doing great in North Korea. We're doing great in a lot of different places. We knocked out the caliphate in Syria. We knocked out 100%. Remember I was going to leave it?\nNo, no, no, the caliphate.\nNo, the caliphate, which is the land.\n-- is 100%. You never knock these people out.\nThese people are stone cold crazy. And they walk into a store and they'll be wired up for bombs and they'll blow -- it's a horrible thing. So I never say that. I don't want to do what other presidents have done or other people have done saying, \"We won,\" because you don't win so conclusively. I would love to have the day where we can win. You know, I remember when I was young I'd go on airplane and I'd walk up, I'd buy a ticket, I'd go on a plane. Nobody thought about bombs and nobody thought about security. You'd walk in, you'd give the ticket to the person at the gate and you'd walk into a plane. Today it's like, a big deal. So what happened is I said, \"I'm not going to do it. I'll save it. If they do something else, it'll be double.\"\nNo, I don't think so. And I think it was very important that they, to them, don't forget, their economy --\nTheir inflation is through the roof. They've never had, the highest in the world right now. Worse than any place. They're, they're living not well.\nI think they want to negotiate. And I think they want to make a deal. And my deal is nuclear. Look, they're not going to have a nuclear weapon. This isn't about the straits. Do you know that China gets 91% of its oil from the straits? We don't even need the straits. We have, we are now, because of -- since I came in, we're the number one energy producer in the world. Okay? Actually by far. And if I get the pipelines approved through the environmental process, which I will in Texas, we'll go up by another 25%. But we're way ahead of Russia, we're way ahead of Saudi Arabia. And I think that they want to negotiate. I don't think they like the position they're in. Their economy is, is absolutely broken.\nI didn't send a letter, no.\nI didn't, I didn't send a letter. No, no --\nPrime Minister Abe's a great guy. He's a friend of mine. And he obviously is close to them. I think he was their, their largest buyer of oil from before.\nNo. He wanted to do something.\nAccording to Prime Minister Abe, they went to him, it's according to the prime minister, and they said, \"What do we do with Trump? Can we make a deal? Is there something that can be done?\" That's what Prime Minster Abe told me. I said, \"Do you mind if I say that if I have to?\" And he said, \"Not particularly.\" So they came to Prime Minister Abe. He then called me. I said, \"Send the following message: you can't have nuclear weapons. And other than that, we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear --\"\n\"-- weapons.\"\nYou cannot have nuclear weapons. And they would have had them with President Obama. He gave them $150 billion --\nRemember this.\nBut, Chuck, you have to remember this.\nLet me explain something. Number one, you have to look at the sites. Some of the most important sites we weren't even allowed to look at or inspect, okay? Number two, the term was not long enough.\nThere's like a short number of years left. After a very small number of years, he's talking about a country, after a very small number of years, they have a free pass to nuclear weapons. You can't do that. So I want to be able to inspect all sites. They cannot have ballistic missiles, which under the agreement, isn't even covered. And as you know, that agreement wasn't even approved by Congress. A lot of people don't know that. That was an agreement that he couldn't get through Congress. He was not authorized, really, to do that deal.\nIt wasn't ratified by Congress.\nIt was very, very short of what it should have been. You know that.\nWell, you see, I think they have violated the agreement because I think in the areas that we're not allowed to inspect they're doing things. And I think they have been for years.\nWell, I don't care about the Europeans. The Europeans are going out and making a lot of money. The Europeans are fine. But they're going out and making a lot of money. They're selling, in France, they're selling cars to Iran. They're doing other things. And let me tell you, we're very good to Europe. We take care of them. NATO, we spend a tremendous amount, a disproportionate amount. On trade, the European Union's taken, really, they have really taken advantage of us for a long time. Just to finish, we have great relationships with Europe. I don't mind Europe getting in the middle. Europe wants to make a deal too. Europe would love to see a deal be made.\nI don't care which, what kind of a deal. It can be separate or it could be total.\nIt doesn't matter to me. Here's what I want, anything that gets you to the result. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's not about the straits. You know, a lot of people covered it incorrectly. They're never mentioned. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. They'd use it. And they're not going to have a nuclear weapon.\nAnd it's not about the oil.\nWrong. It's wrong. I did not send that message. I did not send that message. I don't know who --\nI don't know who would have said that.\nI mean it's fake news.\nWouldn't be much different than that message.\nI'm not looking for war and if there is, it'll be obliteration like you've never seen before. But I'm not looking to do that. But you can't have a nuclear weapon. You want to talk? Good. Otherwise you can have a bad economy for the next --\n-- three years. Not as far as I'm concerned. No pre-conditions.\nHere it is. Look, you can't have nuclear weapons. And if you want to talk about it, good. Otherwise you can live in a shattered economy for a long time to come.\nI have two groups of people. I have doves and I have hawks.\nI have some hawks. Yeah, John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he'd take on the whole world at one time, okay? But that doesn't matter because I want both sides. You know, some people said, \"Why did you put --\" You know, I was against going into Iraq for years and years. And before it ever happened I was against going into Iraq. And some people said, \"Oh I don't know.\" I was totally against and I was a private citizen. It never made sense to me. I was against going into the Middle East. Chuck, we've spent $7 trillion in the Middle East right now.\nBecause of nuclear weapons. It has nothing to do with oil.\nThat's all I care. I don't care about -- Well, we're going to protect Israel. But I have nothing to do, absolutely nothing -- and we're going to protect Saudi Arabia. Look, Saudi Arabia is buying $400 billion worth of things for us. That's a very good thing.\nWe are now.\n-- I spoke to the Crown Prince, this morning. And we had a great conversation. I said, \"This is a very expensive operation. You and the other nations that we're protecting have to pay.\"\nAnd he said, \"Yes.\"\nI did not because it really didn't come up in that discussion. I called about one reason.\nI called about one -- I didn't call about that. I called about one reason. There's a very expensive operation. Unlike President Obama and unlike everybody else, I'll say others too, not just President Obama. You've got to pay for it. We cannot, we, we just don't want to go in and, and protect the Middle East and protect Saudi Arabia and everyone else and not get reimbursed.\nEconomic development and that. But economic development.\nA million jobs.\nA million jobs -- No it's going to end. It's going to end. By the way, who's causing it though? If you look at it, Iran goes into Yemen. They start firing rockets at Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has to protect themselves, Chuck. But it's, it's a million jobs and probably more. They buy massive amounts, $150 billion worth of military equipment that, by the way, we use. We use that military equipment. And unlike other countries that don't have money and we have to subsidize everything. So Saudi Arabia is a big buyer of America product. That means something to me. It's a big producer of jobs.\nNo.\nI don't like anybody's bad behavior.\nI think it's been heavily investigated.\nBy everybody. I mean --\nI've seen so many different reports.\nHere's where I am, you ready?\nIran's killed many, many people a day. Other countries in the Middle East, this is a hostile place. This is a vicious, hostile place. If you're going to look at Saudi Arabia, look at Iran, look at other countries, I won't mention names, and take a look at what's happening. And then you go outside of the Middle East, and you take a look at what's happening with countries. Okay? And I only say they spend $400 to $450 billion over a period of time --\nNo, no.\nBut I'm not like a fool that says, \"We don't want to do business with them.\" And by the way, if they don't do business with us, you know what they do? They'll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese. They will buy -- We make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China. Chuck --\nTake their money. Take their money, Chuck.\nWell, let's, let's take a look. Let's take a look --\nOkay, let's take a look. The border's doing great. Mexico's been fantastic. They've been trying to get a deal with Mexico for 45 years, right? So for 45 years, they couldn't get a deal. I got one in one day. I said, \"We're going to put tariffs on and we're going to either have a deal or not. We agreed in one day.\" Mexico just moved 6,000 people to their southern border. 6,000 troops to their southern border. The border's working out well. And the wall is being built. I mean, a lot of people don't like to talk about it. We're building the wall. We will have 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year and that's hard because the Democrats don't want to approve it. We just beat them in a big lawsuit, as you know, in Washington, in D.C. We just beat them in a very big lawsuit.\nNo, because the people are coming up because our economy is so good. They're pouring up because the economy is so good. Obama had a lousy economy. It was a dead economy.\nOur, our economy is good.\nYeah.\nRight.\nThat's because he started off with a, with such a bad base. I mean, he hit --\nYeah, but Chuck, you have to understand, nobody was working. The whole place was a disaster. And I don't-- I'd never take that away.\n-- because when that turned around they pumped a tremendous amount of money into the economy. He also had a Federal Reserve person who kept the interest rates low. I don't. I don't have that privilege.\nNo, no, no.\nHe raised them far too fast.\nHe raised them far too fast.\nI didn't ever threaten to demote him.\nWell, I, I, I'd be able to do that if I wanted but I haven't suggested that. I mean --\nNo, no, I have the right to do that. But I haven't said that. What he's done is $50 billion a month in quantitative tightening. That's ridiculous. What he's done is he raised interest rates too fast.\nI've been proven right.\nI think the economy's so strong we're going to bull through it. But I'm not happy with his actions. No, I don't think he's done a good job. I think this, if he didn't raise rates Obama had very low rates. So Obama was playing with funny money. I wasn't. I'm playing with the real stuff.\nWait, wait. Obama had somebody that kept the rates very low. I had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly. Too much. He made a mistake. That's been proven. And yet my economy is phenomenal. We have now the best economy, maybe in the history of our country. One -- just to finish off, when I took over, this country, the economy was ready to collapse. You take a look at the numbers. It was ready to collapse. And if I didn't win --\nNo no, no, that's -- You showed me unemployment numbers.\nExcuse me.\nExcuse me. Take a look at your GDP, take a look at your jobs, take a look at your optimism.\nTake a look at all of the charts. When I took over from election day on, I mean, you show me one chart which, where I did --\n: -- talking about that. Take a look at some of the optimism charts and everything else. It went from 57 to 92. Nobody's ever seen anything that --\n-- right after I won.\nWell, optimism is a big part of success in business. Okay.\nHe was not a cheerleader.\nWell, it would be personnel.\nI would say if I had one do over, it would be, I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. That would be my one --\nYeah, that was the biggest mistake.\nYou have to understand, Roy Cohn, but I had many, many lawyers. I mean, a lot of lawyers. Roy was one of them. He was a tough guy. Bill Barr is a -- First of all, Bill Barr --\nBill Barr is a very, he's equally tough. He's a fine man. He's a fine man. The job he's done is incredible. He's brought sanity back. I think he's real -- I don't think, I know, he's respected. You know, he loves the Department of Justice. He saw what was happening. He has done a spectacular job. Now he's in the process of doing something and I stay away from it. I really, I stay away from it. But I think he feels that what's happened in this country was a very bad thing and very bad for our country.\nYeah.\nAre you ready?\nI agree. And it's been --\n-- that way for a long time.\nAnd President Obama built the cages. Remember when they said that I built them? And then it was 1914 --\nExcuse me.\nIt was 2014. Chuck, just listen for one second.\nSeparation, President Obama, I took over separation. I'm the one that put it together. What's happened though are the cartels and all of these bad people, they're using the kids. They're, they're, it's almost like slavery.\nYou're right. And this has been happening long before I got there. What we've done is we've created, we've, we've ended separation. You know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it. Now I said one thing, when I ended it I said, \"Here's what's going to happen. More families are going to come up.\" And that's what's happened. But they're really coming up for the economics. But once you ended the separation. But I ended separation. I inherited separation from President Obama. President Obama built, they call them jail cells. They were built --\nWe're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances. The Democrats aren't even approving giving us money. Where is the money? You know what? The Democrats are holding up the humanitarian aid.\nWell, they are being used.\n--paid, where money is being made using them because our laws are so bad. Because if you have a child, you have an advantage. You know that better than anybody. And what should happen, Chuck --\nIf the Democrats would change the asylum laws and the loopholes, which they refuse to do because they think it's good politics, everything would be solved immediately. But they refuse to do it. They refuse to do it.\nYou know what? If they change those, I say, I used to say 45 minutes. It's 15 minutes. If they changed asylum and if they changed loopholes everything on the border would be perfect.\nBecause I think she feels that I will win much easier. I mean, I've been told that by many people.\nI think I win the election easier. But, you know, I'm not sure that I like having it. Look, I did nothing wrong. I was spied on. What they did to me was illegal. It was illegal on the other side. I did nothing wrong. So impeachment's a very unfair thing because nothing that I did was wrong. And if you look at the Mueller report, there was no collusion. This was all about collusion.\nThis was about conspiracy.\nUse the word collusion. Use the word conspiracy.\nI'll be honest with you, nobody even mentions Russia anymore since the Mueller report. They don't mention it, in all fairness.\nNobody mentions Russia anymore. And it was about Russia. It was a hoax.\nWait a minute.\nWait, wait. We'll give you the time that you need.\nIt was a hoax. The Russian hoax with me.\n-- respect to the election is different. We're not talking about that. We're talking about --\n-- my campaign working is a hoax.\nOkay. Good.\nWell, I, I wouldn't have. But this was well-known. I think it was in papers. And, again, I'm going back now a long ways. But --\nWait a minute. But --\n--but how would I even know that? I made a speech. It was in there about WikiLeaks. I'm not a --\n-- WikiLeaks person.\nHey, Chuck.\nOk.\nLet me tell you-- WikiLeaks, et cetera, that's not my deal in life. You know, in other words, I don't know about WikiLeaks. It was a strange name. But there were stories about something WikiLeaks that they had information. And I say it in a joking manner at a speech. Joking. Everybody laughing. Everybody having a -- And they made it like it was serious. No, I don't want anything bad to happen to our country. Anything bad happens to this country, I will end it and I'll end it fast. I don't want any of that to happen.\nRight. That's right.\nI don't know. I can only tell you this --\nI, I really don't know.\nBut let me tell you what I do know.\nLet me tell you, I read much of it.\nI read -- No I didn't.\nI didn't. But let me just tell you --\nYou know what I read? I read the --\n-- I read, I read the conclusion.\nWell, he was subpoenaed. Ultimately he was subpoenaed to sit before the Senate Intel --\n-- and he did that.\nI don't know. But I don't think so.\nI don't know.\nI really don't know. But you can certainly ask him. I just --\n-- don't know. It was, it was -- He sat, my son, he's been treated so unfairly. He sat for many, many hours before these committees. I think, my impression is, that Mueller took all of the information from the committees and he used that information. How much, how much can you talk about something? Remember the phone calls, the three phone calls? It was such a big deal. Three phone calls that were made to a special type number.\nOkay? And everybody said, \"Oh, he called his father.\" That went on for a year. In other words, before this so-called meeting and after the meeting, \"He called his father,\" the biggest story. Headlines all over the place. And then it turned out, and I give Mueller credit because Mueller was the one that found out through I guess the phone companies or whatever. Somebody found out, maybe through the FBI. Big investigation on who the calls were made. If they were made to me, it would have sounded like you, wait a minute, they turned out that it wasn't to me. It was to a real estate person and a NASCAR person. Two great people, have nothing to do with Russia. Have nothing to do. And you know what? People hardly even put the story in. My son was treated unfairly. My son, he spent 20 some odd hours and then he went back again.\nHe was a very innocent, young man and he was treated very badly.\nYes. I'm going to see many people.\nI may.\nI may.\nI may if you'd like me to do it, I'll do that.\nYou know what? Here's what you do --\nOh, that's not true. That's not true.\nMy answer last week was both. I said both. I'd do both. Except they didn't put it on. And when they did put it on people understood. But they didn't put it on because they put a different segment on. So they ask me a question. But when I said, \"Yeah, I'd do both,\" people saw that in the last version of it because the thing played like all weekend and on Friday. So it's just more fake news. Chuck, there's so much fake news. It would be so good if --\nThat's fine. That's why I like --\nBut I like live interviews better, you know why? Because you can't cut the answers.\nOk. Good.\nDo you think you've been more successful in business or the presidency?\nI think, well, I can't be more successful in politics. I mean, I ran once and I'm president, right? So you have to say that's about -- there's nothing-- it's never happened before, right? So I'm one for one and I hope to be two for two. But my business has been a tremendous success. I actually said to the lawyers, \"I'd like to show my financial statement. My financial statement's great.\" I built a great business --\nI actually don't believe -- You don't learn from tax returns. And I'm under audit, Chuck. I've been saying it. I'm under audit. But you don't learn from tax returns.\n-- statement. And I would like to release it. I've built a great company. They like to -- For instance, banks. Banks. I could have borrowed from banks. But I didn't need to because I had money. I did things, in fact, a lot of people over the last couple of years were really surprised. \"He paid all cash, he didn't use banks.\" I think I've been tremendously successful in business. I think I've been tremendously successful in show business with The Apprentice. I mean, I did one show and it was a great hit, as you know, from NBC.\nAnd I guess you have to say I've been really successful at politics.\nI think common sense caused it. You know, I'm about common sense. People say, \"Are you conservative?\" I guess I'm conservative, but I'm about common sense. I'm about we need borders. We're going to have borders. And we have strong borders. And by the way, Mexico has done a great job. It's slowed down so much. But we have an amazing economy and people want to come up. But it's slowed down so much. But I'm about borders. I'm about great health care. Obamacare is a disaster. I got rid of the individual mandate.\nBecause I've managed it great.\nI had a choice. I could have let it implode and killed it or I could have managed it --\nNo, no.\nI am in favor of preexisting conditions. I am fighting --\nIt has nothing to do with it. The lawsuit is one thing. We are going to put in a bill, total preexisting conditions. And the Republicans are in favor of preexisting conditions.\nChuck, are you ready?\nWe had a negative vote from John McCain. It was a surprising vote. But I got rid of the worst part of Obamacare which was the individual mandate.\nWe will always protect pre-existing conditions. And the reason Obamacare continues is my decision. Wait, I made a big decision.\nWe have a man named Azar, our secretary, he's fantastic man, Alex. A total pro. I could have managed Obamacare so it would have failed or I could have managed it the way we did so it's as good as it can be. Not great, but it's as good -- It's too expensive and the premiums are too high. I had a decision to make. I could have politically killed Obamacare. I decided not to do it. But still it's not good. We're going to come up with great health care if we win the House, the Senate and the presidency.\nNo. Probably not. Probably not.\nIt would be much better, it would be much better if I said, \"Yeah.\"\nIt would be much easier for me to say, \"Oh yes.\" No I'm probably not too prepared to lose. I don't like losing. I haven't lost very much in my life.\nWell, I think it was a -- I mean, I'll say something that, again, is controversial. There were a lot of votes cast that I don't believe. I look at California.\nExcuse me.\nTake a look at Judicial Watch, take a look at their settlement where California admitted to a million votes. They admitted to a million votes.\nJudicial Watch made a settlement. There was, there was much --\n-- there was much illegal voting. But let me tell you about popular vote. Do you have a second?\nWell, I like popular vote.\nI think I do better with a popular vote. But I didn't campaign for the popular vote.\nYou didn't see me campaigning in California or New York. If I -- if it was up to the popular vote, I would have been I think even better. I won 306 to 223, which was a lot in the Electoral College. But it's like you're training for the 100-yard dash versus the mile.\nIt's totally different.\nI went to Wisconsin. --\n-- She forgot. I went to Michigan. She didn't go to Michigan enough. I won Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. I won places that she didn't do a good job. What can I tell you? No, maybe I did a great job. You know, I never get credit for that. They always say she was a lousy candidate. I actually think that Hillary Clinton was a great candidate. She was very smart. She was very tough. She was ruthless and vicious.\nNo.\nNo.\nNo. I would actually rather run against Biden.\nI think that would be my preference.\nSleepy Joe. He's sleepy. She was not sleepy. Let me just tell you something, the Electoral College is tougher for a Republican to win than the popular vote. At least me. I feel that I go to three places. I went to 19 or 21 states. I went to Maine four times because I wanted to get one. And I did get it. And that's the beauty of the Electoral College.\nYou know, I've been a proponent of the other sometimes and I change. But I will tell you, the Electoral College brings you to many of the states in this country.\nI only joke.\nI joke. And I say \"Watch, I will drive Chuck Todd crazy.\"\nYes, there won't be a third term.\n100%. Sure.\nSure.\nIn fact, I said at a speech recently, I said, \"Watch. We'll drive the media crazy. Let's go for a third time and then a fourth.\" And some of the media said, \"He's going to do it.\"\nWell, look, look -- 100%, yes.\nOh yeah.\nHe's been, he's been a terrific vice president. He's my friend and --\n-- a lot of things. No. Zero. Zero.\nBecause it was a surprise question.\nI mean, you know, I'm not even thinking of it. It's so far out. I mean, It's so far out. That would be the only reason. Now what happens in 2024? I don't know that Mike is going to run. I don't know who's running or anything else. I will say this, I think it's a tremendous embarrassment to Joe Biden that Obama has not, that President Obama, I like to say that because it's respect for the office and respect for him.\nYes.\nWell, I speak to Bush.\nI speak to Jimmy Carter.\n-- pretty much from the beginning.\nI have spoken to Bush, I have spoken to Jimmy Carter, yes.\nI like Jimmy Carter. You know, Jimmy Carter's oftentimes come to my defense. I don't necessarily agree with the way he ran things and that's okay. And he understands that and so do I. But he came to my defense on numerous occasions. And he thinks that I was treated the worst of anybody he's ever seen by the press.\nI don't think he's including you.\nI think that the economy has tremendous upward potential despite the fact that we're doing really well. I think when we really unleash some of the things --\nI also think that health care is going to be very important for me. I will tell you. If we win the House, the Senate and the presidency I will get tremendous health care because --\n-- Obamacare is a disaster.\nI think they won because of preexisting condition.\nNothing to do with me. Because if you know almost every race that I campaigned for somebody they won. But I couldn't devote too much time to the House, there's too many people. But if you look at some of the Congressmen that I did go for and went for, they won like in Kentucky, et cetera, et cetera.\nJust one thing. Ohio governor, he was behind, great guy.\nMike won. Georgia, President Obama was there. Oprah was there. Michelle Obama was there. It was going to be a big celebration. She was the star of the party. I went there for Brian. Brian Kemp. Brian Kemp won. Florida, Ron DeSantis --\nHe was going to lose. He was low in the polls. I endorsed him. He went up 60 points after I endorsed him. Ron won. And he's been a great governor of Florida. You know, I've always heard that an endorsement is nice to have but it doesn't mean anything. I'm driving people up 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%.\nWe bring something very good.\nI was very impressed, yes.\nI liked what Jon Stewart did. I actually did. And I actually have a meeting on that subject next week. So we'll see what happens.\nYou know it's a very complicated subject for a lot of reasons.\nI have a meeting with that, on that subject with -- Well, when you say Congress, billions of dollars has been passed.\nOkay, billions.\nMemorials have been, have been built.\nTremendous amounts of money. But there are still people that are sick. I have a meeting on it next week.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-chuck-todd-nbc-news-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France in Biarritz, France", "Date": "2019-08-26", "Text": "Thank you. Well, I want to thank you very much. And I think more importantly than anything, I wanted to come up here to say that, because the job that President Macron and your wife, by the way, who is a great lady, Brigitte. I would like to thank Brigitte. She has been spectacular. Spent a tremendous amount of time with Melania and some of the folks who came in, some of the wives that came in. And they had a great tour of the area. And it's a beautiful area.\nBut I want to thank you very much, Mr. President, for the incredible job you did. This is a truly successful G-7. There was tremendous unity. It was great unity. Sometimes, I'd read a little bit of false reporting. And I will tell you, there was—in fact, we were—we would have stayed for another hour. Nobody wanted to leave. We were accomplishing a lot. But I think, more importantly, we were getting along very well, seven countries. And it really was the G-7.\nAnd you have been a spectacular leader on this. And I want to thank you and I want to thank the great country of France. Thank you very much.\n[At this point, President Macron spoke in English as follows.]\nOh, excuse me. I was—[laughter]. Go ahead. Let's go.\nOkay.\nIf you'd like, we could two each, and then we both leave the room. Would you prefer that? Or would you prefer I take—I just don't want to have the President of France standing here while I'm answering these absolutely wonderful questions. Okay? [Laughter]\nSo why don't we start with a question for France?\nAnd Emmanuel is going to have his own press conference after this.\nSo that will be fine. Go ahead.\nTo France, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. To France.\n[White House press assistant Margo T. Martin handed a microphone to Mr. Roberts.]\nNo, I'm not. But——\nYes.\nWe're getting there, John. We've just answered that. We're getting there.\nChina-U.S. Trade Negotiations\nYes.\nWe'll see, John.\nI do. I think they want to make a deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night, very late in the night. I see an alert—or, as you would call it, \"breaking news.\" And it was that the Vice Chairman—we're not talking about somebody from China at a low level—the Vice Chairman of China came out that he wants to see a deal made, he wants it to be made under calm conditions, using the word \"calm.\" I agree with him on that.\nAnd China has taken a very hard hit over the last number of months. You know, they've lost 3 million jobs. It will soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking. A chain is breaking up like nobody has seen before. And once that happens, it's very hard to put it back together. You understand.\nI think they want—very much want—to make a deal. And the longer they wait, the harder it is to put it back, if it can be put back at all. So I believe they want to do a deal.\nThe tariffs have hit them very hard in a fairly short period of time. The United States will have collected over $100 billion in tariffs. And I say it again: The reporters failed to—the media failed to acknowledge it. But if you look at the goods coming in from China—we're talking about China, not other countries. If you look at the goods, they have a power that others don't have. But that power is only good for so long.\nThey've manipulated their currency, they've devalued their currency, and they put a lot of cash into the system. And because of that, the prices have not gone up. Or if they've gone up, it's been very little, because they want to keep people working. If the prices go up, they're not going to be able to keep people working; they're not going to be able to compete. It's a brilliant market. It's a brilliant, brilliant market, the world market. A lot of markets are brilliant.\nAnd frankly, I think that China cannot—I don't know, maybe they can, maybe they can't. I don't think they can do that. And I think they're very smart. And I think President Xi is a great leader, who happens to be a brilliant man. And he can't lose 3 million jobs in a very short period of time. And that's going to be magnified many times over. And it's going to break down the Chinese system of trade, and he can't do that.\nSo when you say, \"Do you think they want to?\" Maybe they want to, and maybe they don't. But I think they want to make a deal. I'm not sure they have a choice. And I don't say that as a threat. I don't think they have a choice. In the meantime, the United States, which has never collected 10 cents from China, will, in a fairly short period of time, be over $100 billion in tariffs. So I think they want to make a deal very badly. Okay?\nGo ahead.\nIran is a country that is not the same country that it was 2½ years ago when I came into office. Iran was the number-one state of terror throughout the world. There were 18 sites of confliction in my first week. When I spoke with the folks at the Pentagon, including lots of generals and lots of other military experts—18 sites of confliction, meaning, 18 sites of big problems. Every one of them was backed by Iran or, in some cases, actually using Iranian soldiers. But at a minimum, Iranian wealth—much of it given in the ridiculous deal where they were given $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash. And they used that money for some bad purposes.\nWith that being said, I think that Iran is a country of tremendous potential. We're not looking for leadership change. We're not looking for that kind of change. This country has been through that many times before. That doesn't work.\nWe're looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles, and a longer period of time. Very simple. We can have it done in a very short period of time. And I really believe that Iran can be a very great nation. I'd like to see that happen. But they can't nuclear weapons. Okay? Thank you.\nExcuse me?\nIf the circumstances were correct or right, I would certainly agree to that. But in the meantime, they have to be good players. You understand what that means. And they can't do what they were saying they're going to do because if they do that, they're going to be met with really very violent force. We'd have no choice. So I think they're going to be good. I really think they'd like to.\nAnd by the way, President Macron told me every step that he was making yesterday. A lot of you said, \"Oh, he came in and\"—he told me long before he came in what was happening, what was—I didn't think it was appropriate to meet yesterday. Too soon, and things have to be worked out first.\nBut President Macron told me exactly what was happening, who was coming, what time they were coming, where they were going to meet. And after the meeting, he told me exactly what happened. And I think he had a very positive meeting.\nPrime Minister Abe of Japan, also a large purchaser of oil from Iran, he was also very much involved. And you know, look, he knows everybody there, so he was a very, very positive force. But I have to tell you the President has done an excellent job, and we're going to see how it all turns out. Maybe it works; maybe it doesn't. I say it all the time about everything: Maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't. But I'll tell you what, we made a ridiculous deal. We gave them $150 billion. We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing. We got nothing. And by the way, that agreement was so short term that it expires in a very short period of time. With a country, you don't make a deal that short. Countries last for long times, and you don't do short-term deals, especially when you're paying that kind of money.\nSo I have—I have good feelings about Iran. I have good feelings that it will work. I know many Iranians living in New York City. I have many friends from Iran. They're incredible people. Incredible people. So the last thing I'd like to see is a big problem. But we have to do what we have to do. Okay?\nGo ahead, please. No. No, no. You first. Go ahead. Oh, no. Go ahead. Yes. Yes.\nIran/Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action/North Korea/France-U.S. Relations\nI have to say, the JCPOA was a bad deal. Should not have been entered into. A lot of things could have happened that would have been much different. They're allowed to test ballistic missiles. You're not allowed to go to various sites to check, and some of those sites are the most obvious sites for the creation or the making of nuclear weapons. And those things have to be changed, and other things have to be changed.\nAnd I will tell you, I have very good feelings about it. I think that we're going to do something. It may not be immediately, but I think, ultimately, we're going to do something. As I said, Iran is a much different country than it was 2½ years ago. And we can get that back, and I'd encourage it.\nI actually had friends years ago—many years ago—they were in the real estate business and they were in Iran, and they were building houses and building housing and building office buildings and apartment houses. And they did very well. They made a lot of money. And to this day, they're not exactly the youngest developers anymore, but I tell you; they were young when they went over there. They made a lot of money, and they loved the people, and they loved what was going on. And it's a country with tremendous potential.\nI also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea. Kim Jong Un—who I've gotten to know extremely well; the First Lady has gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she'd agree with me—he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential. You're in between China, Russia, and South Korea. People want to get to South Korea. They've got to get there somehow. And if they're going to do anything other than essentially fly, they want to go through. So railroads and everything else. So many things want to happen there.\nI think that North Korea has tremendous economic potential. And I think that Kim Jong Un sees that he would be the leader, and I think he sees the tremendous potential that it's got.\nWith respect to Iran, same thing. Iran has incredible people and incredible country, potentially. Location, that's a little rough neighborhood, but eventually, it's going to be a beautiful neighborhood. I think that it's going to be—I think it's going to work out.\nAnd I really believe that those countries that went into the original deal—that more and more are agreeing with what I did—but I think those countries are going to be saying \"thank you\" someday. I hope they're going to be saying it, including France, including the President, because I think we did the right thing. I know we did the right thing. If for no other reason, it's just too short. It's almost expiring, if you think about it.\nAnd somebody said, \"Well you'll go and make an extension.\" No. No. They're great negotiators. Look at what they did to get the deal. Look at what they did to John Kerry and to President Obama. Look what happened, where they're bringing plane loads of cash. Plane loads. Big planes—757s. Boeing 757s coming in, loaded up with cash. What kind of a deal is that?\nSo I think a lot of good things are going to happen. And I just want to say this, because I've spoken a lot with the President this last 2½ days: We've never had a better relationship. We had a lunch that lasted for quite a while that many of you got to see. It was the two of us. No staff. No anything. He wasn't trying to impress his people. I wasn't trying to impress his people. We were just trying to impress each other. [Laughter] And I'll tell you what: It was the best period of time we've ever had, and we accomplished a lot. I don't mean just, \"Gee whiz, wasn't that nice?\" He's a very capable man. He's doing a great job for France. He did an incredible job for the G-7. And I just want to thank you.\nAnd you go ahead to your news conference. And very special. This was a very special, very unified 2½ days, and I want to thank you for it. Thank you.\nThank you, my friend.\nI can confirm that the First Lady loved your French wine, okay? [Laughter] All right? She loved your French wine. So thank you very much. That's fine. You go ahead.\nGood job.\n[President Macron left the stage, and President Trump continued to take questions from reporters.]\nShe's worse than you are! [Laughter] I can't believe it! Jonathan [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Come on up. Let's go.\nGo ahead.\nAll right, we'll start now. Please sit down. Thank you. Thank you. Please sit down.\nThank you very much.\nChina-U.S. Trade\nOnly if it's a fair deal and a good deal for the United States. Otherwise, I will not make a deal. We have billions and billions coming in. And I think we're going to get there. I do. I believe it more strongly now than I would have believed it a while ago. We're going to get there. And we're going to have a really—we're going to have a fair deal.\nBut remember this: When you say \"fair,\" China has been taking, out of this country, five hundred-plus billion dollars a year for many, many years. Many, many years. It was time to stop.\nAs a private person, I used to talk about it. It's one of the reasons I'm President. And we're in a great position. Our country is doing well. Our unemployment numbers are the lowest they've been in over 50 years. Our unemployment numbers for African American—African American, Asian, for Hispanic are the best they've ever been. Historic numbers.\nWe're in a very strong position. Our consumers are strong. Walmart just announced numbers that were, I mean, mindboggling numbers. It's a great poll right there, and it's the ultimate poll, how the retailer is doing and how are certain companies doing. So we're doing very well. And I think that—I think we're going to make a deal with China. And I think we'll probably, eventually, we're going to make a deal with Iran too.\nIt's not a question of behavior. I think they want to make a deal, and I think they should make a deal. And I think if they don't make a deal, it's going to be very bad for China. And I very much appreciate the fact that they came out last night—very late last night—and they said, you know, they want to make a deal. They want it to be under calm circumstances. It was a little different kind of a statement. I thought it was a beautiful statement. I thought it indicated a lot.\nGo ahead.\nHere we go.\nOne question. Go ahead.\nNo, no, no.\nOne question.\nYes.\nYes.\nWell, I'll tell you what: I've spent—and I think I will, in a combination of loss and opportunity, probably, it will cost me anywhere from three to five billion dollars to be President. And the only thing I care about is this country. Couldn't care less. Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.\nPeople have asked me, \"What do you think it costs?\" And between opportunity, not doing things—I used to get a lot of money to make speeches. Now I give speeches all the time. You know what I get? Zippo. And that's good. And I did a lot of great jobs and great deals that I don't do anymore. And I don't want to do them, because the deals I'm making are great deals for the country. And that's, to me, much more important.\nDoral happens to be within Miami. It's a city. It's a wonderful place. It's a very, very successful area of Florida. It's, very importantly, only 5 minutes from the airport; the airport is right next door. It's a big international airport, one of the biggest in the world. Everybody that's coming—all of these people with all of their big entourages come. It's set up so—and, by the way, my people looked at 12 sites. All good, but some were 2 hours from an airport. Some were 4 hours from—I mean, they were so far away. Some didn't allow this, or they didn't allow that.\nWith Doral, we have a series of magnificent buildings; we call them bungalows. They each hold from 50 to 70 very luxurious rooms with magnificent views. We have incredible conference rooms, incredible restaurants. It's like—it's like such a natural—we wouldn't even have to do the work that they did here. And they've done a beautiful job. They've really done a beautiful job.\nAnd what we have also is Miami. And we have many hundreds of acres, so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need, the ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida and the best. It's brandnew. And they want—my people wanted it. From my standpoint, I'm not going to make any money. In my opinion, I'm not going to make any money. I don't want to make money. I don't care about making money. If I wanted to make money, I wouldn't worry about $3 billion to $5 billion. Because that's what—I mean, at some point, I'm going to detail that and will show.\nBut I think it's just a great place to be. I think having it in Miami is fantastic. Really fantastic. Having it at that particular place, because of the way it's set up, each country can have their own villa, or their own bungalow. And the bungalows, when I say, they have a lot of units in them. So I think it just works out well.\nAnd when my people came back, they took tours, they went to different places. I won't mention places, but you'll have a list, because they're going to give a presentation on it fairly soon. They went to places all over the country. And they came back, and they said, \"This is where we'd like it to be.\" Now, we had military people doing it. We had Secret Service people doing it. We had people that really understand what it's about. It's not about me, it's about getting the right location. I think it's very important.\nNo. Not at all. Go ahead, Jonathan.\nIt does.\nWell, it does. I don't know the gentleman. I think that—I think I know him a little bit just by watching over the last number of years what's happened. I'll tell you one thing: He's a great negotiator.\nBut he—I think he's going to want to meet. I think Iran wants to get this situation straightened out. Now, is that based on fact or based on gut? That's based on gut. But they want to get their situation straightened out, Jonathan. And they're really hurting badly.\nTheir inflation, as you know, because I saw you reporting on it, their inflation is through the roof. Their economy has tanked entirely. The sanctions are absolutely hurting them horribly. I don't want to see that. I don't want to see that. They're great people. I don't want to see that. But we can't let them have a nuclear weapon. Can't let it happen. So I think that there's a really good chance that we would meet.\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], please.Iran\nNo.\nNo. What he's talking, in terms of compensation, is they are out of money. And they meet—may need a short-term letter of credit or loan.\nNo, we're not paying. We don't pay. But they may need some money to get them over a very rough patch. And if they do need money, certainly—and it would be secured by oil, which to me is great security. And they have a lot of oil. But it's secured bail. So we're really talking about a letter of credit-type facility.\nIt would be from numerous countries. It would be numerous countries. And it comes back. It would be—it would expire. It would be paid back immediately and very quickly.\nGood.\nGood. Just left your Prime Minister, Abe. Good man. Great man.\nAnd for Japan, I would say.\nNot at this moment, no. Not at this moment. Well, it's one of the reasons we made the deal. But no, not at this moment. It's something I could do at a later date if I wanted to, but we're not looking at that. We just want to be treated fairly.\nYou know, Japan has had a tremendous trade surplus with the United States for many, many years—long before I came here. And I'll tell you something: We're transforming our country. We're taking these horrible, one-sided, foolish, very dumb, stupid—if you'd like to use that word, because it's so descriptive. We're taking these trade deals that are so bad, and we we're making good, solid deals out of them. And that's transforming our country. That's—that will be transformative and very exciting, I think, for our country. Very, very exciting.\nPlease, go ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, I didn't actually say you; I said the woman behind you. So why don't we do her first? You've been asking a lot of questions all day long.Q.Thanks, Mr. President. Yamiche Alcindor.\nDon't say I don't give you access, right? [Laughter] Go ahead.\nYes.\nI don't care politically. I really don't. A lot of people don't understand this. I ran one election, and I won. It happened to be for President. I don't care politically. I'm going to run another election. I think I'm winning based on polls that we see. Whether I win or not, I have to do the right thing.\nSo I don't do things for political reasons. Is it good? Probably not. Maybe it is. I mean, a lot of people are smart. A lot of people say having Russia—which is a power—having them inside the room is better than having them outside the room. By the way, there were numerous people during the G-7 that felt that way. And we didn't take a vote or anything, but we did discuss it.\nMy inclination is to say, \"Yes, they should be in.\" They were—really, it was a President Obama—I'm not blaming him, but a lot of bad things happened with President Putin and President Obama. One of the things that happened was, as you know, what happened in—with a very big area—a very, very big and important area in the Middle East, where the redline was drawn, and then President Obama decided that he was not going to do anything about it. You can't draw redlines in the sand. You just can't do it.\nAnd the other was in Ukraine having to do with a certain section of Ukraine that you know very well, where it was sort of taken away from President Obama. Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama.\nPresident Obama was not happy that this happened, because it was embarrassing to him. Right? It was very embarrassing to him. And he wanted Russia to be out of the—what was called the G-8. And that was his determination. He was outsmarted by Putin. He was outsmarted. President Putin outsmarted President Obama.\nWait a minute. And I can understand how President Obama would feel. He wasn't happy. And they're not in for that reason.\nNow, I'm only thinking about the world and I'm thinking about this country in terms of the G-7, whether it's G-7, G-8. I think it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent. Do we live either way? Yes, we live either way. Is it politically popular for me to say that? Possibly not. I think a lot of people would agree with me, frankly, but possibly not.\nI do nothing for politics. I know a lot of you aren't going to—you're going to smile at that. I do nothing for politics. I do what's right, and people like what I do. And—but I just do what's right.\nWell, he did.\nWell, it was annexed during President—I know you like President Obama, but it was annexed during President Obama's term. If it was annexed during my term, I'd say, \"Sorry, folks, I made a mistake.\" Or, \"Sorry, folks.\" President Obama was helping Ukraine. Crimea was annexed during his term.\nNow, it's a very big area, a very important area. Russia has its submarine—that's where they do their submarine work, and that's where they dock large and powerful submarines. But not as powerful as ours and not as large as ours. But they have their submarines.\nAnd President Obama was, pure and simply, outsmarted. They took Crimea during his term. That was not a good thing. It could have been stopped. It could have been stopped with the right whatever. It could have been stopped. But President Obama was unable to stop it, and it's too bad.\nGo ahead.\nWell, I don't know that he'd accept. And those are tough circumstances. He was a part of G-8, and all of a sudden, he's not out—or he's not in. So I think, John, actually, that's a pretty tough thing for him. You know, he's a proud person. Would I invite him? I would certainly invite him. Whether or not he could come, psychologically, I think that's a tough thing for him to do.\nYou have a G-8, now it's a G-7, and you invite the person that was thrown out, really by President Obama and really because he got outsmarted. President Obama, pure and simple. And don't forget: It was not just Crimea; it was the redline in the sand. And Obama said, \"Never violate the redline in the sand.\" And then they went ahead, and they killed many children with gas. It was terrible. And he did nothing about it.\nI did, but I was there years later. I did something about it, but I was there late.\nWell, we've had many calls. Secretary Mnuchin is here, and you've had many calls over the last 24 hours, but certainly over the last 48 hours. We've had many calls, not just one. This isn't one. And these are high-level calls. They want to make a deal. And by the way, I think a deal is going to be made. But they want to make a deal.\nThe Chinese are not saying that.\nExcuse me, let me explain something. The Vice Chairman of China—do you get higher than that, other than President Xi? The Vice President—the Vice Chairman—it's like the Vice President. The Vice Chairman made the statement that he wants to make a deal, that he wants to see a calm atmosphere. He wants it all to happen. That says it there. I don't have to talk about—you know, you folks who were reporting before, \"Well, we can't find any phone call.\" He released a statement. I didn't release it. He released a statement.\nNumerous calls.\nSecretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin.And as I have said before, there were communications that went back and forth over the last 2 days, as recent as last night.\nAnd not only with Steve; there were calls with other people too.\nJust so you understand: China wants to make a deal. Now, whether or not we make a deal—it's got to be a great deal for us. You know—and I told this to President Xi, who I really respect. I really do. I have great respect, and I like him too. And he's a tough guy, but I have a lot of feeling for President Xi. He's very outstanding in so many ways.\nBut I told him very strongly—I said: \"Look, you're starting up here, and you're making $500 billion a year and stealing our intellectual property. We're down on the floor, lower than the floor. You can't make a 50/50 deal. This has to be a deal that's better for us. And if it's not better, let's not do business together.\" I don't want to do business. Forget about tariffs for a second. We're taking in tremendous amounts of money. Forget that. I don't want to do business.\nNow, when I raise and he raises, I raise and he raises, we can never catch up. We have to balance our trading relationship at least to an extent. And they were unwilling to do that, and we'll never have a deal if that happens. But it's going to happen, because they have to have a deal.\nAnd as far as phone calls are concerned, Secretary of the Treasury and other people have been receiving many calls—not receiving—back and forth, many calls.\nChina wants to make a deal. And if we can, if we will make a deal. We'll see.\nGo ahead.\nGlobal Financial Markets/President Trump's Negotiating Style/China-U.S. Trade Q.Mr. President, if I could ask you a little bit about your China strategy.\nYes.\nYou're talking about global economic instability?\nI don't consider it instability. But that's——\nSorry. It's the way I negotiate.\nYes.\nNo, no, no.\nIt's the way I negotiate. It's done very well for me over the years, and it's doing even better for the country. I think——\nAnd I do think—and I do think that—look, here's the story: I have people say: \"Oh, just make a deal. Make a deal.\" They don't have the guts, and they don't have the wisdom to know that you can't continue to go on where a country is taking $500 billion—not million—$500 billion, with a \"b\"—out every single year. Five hundred billion dollars. You just can't do that. Somebody had to do this.\nThis should have been done by President Obama. It should have been done—and Biden, Sleepy Joe. It should have been done by other people. It should have been done by Bush. It should have been done by Clinton. Double Bush. It should have been done. I'm doing it.\nLet me tell you something else: North Korea should've been done a long time ago. I'm doing it. I'm doing a lot of things that I shouldn't have to be doing.\nPlease. Go ahead, please.\nYes.\nI believe that.Q.Do you think Theresa May was the wrong woman? And do you think that Boris Johnson can actually get a deal with the EU before October the 31st?\nWell, Theresa wasn't able to do the deal. I gave her my ideas as to doing the deal very early on, and you possibly know what they are, but I would've done that. She chose to do it her way, and that didn't work out so well. I think she's a very, very good person and a good woman.\nAnd I really believe that Boris Johnson will be a great Prime Minister. I—you know, we like each other, and we had a great 2½ days. I've been waiting for him to be Prime Minister for about 6 years. I told him, \"What took you so long?\"\nI think he's going to be a great Prime Minister and especially after spending a lot of intense time with him over the last couple of days. He's really a—he's very smart, and he's very strong. And he's very enthusiastic. And you know what else? He loves your country. He really loves your country. That came out, maybe, more than anything else.\nYes, please.\nNo. No. No. I love the U.K. I own great property in the U.K. I love the U.K. I have no idea how my property is doing, because I don't care. But I own Turnberry, and I own in Aberdeen, and I own in Ireland, as you know—Doonbeg—and great stuff.\nAnd I'll be honest with you: I think that he's going to just do a great job as Prime Minister. You know, it takes a lot. It's so many different elements to being a great Prime Minister. And you needed him. I just think his time is right. This is the right time for Boris. This is the right time for Boris.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Go ahead. Right here.\nSay who you're with, please, sir.\nReform Efforts in France/European Union-U.S. Trade\nRight.\nI think we're going to have just—look, France is a great nation. It's being run. A lot of things are happening. You know, it's not easy what he's doing. He's changing certain ways. It's a very hard thing to do. I won't get into it. I'm going to let him sell his ideas. But a lot of people don't disagree with his ideas.\nBut it's a very hard thing to do if you're a great citizen of France. You love your country, but you want to do the way you've been doing it for a long time. But maybe that's not working. And maybe they have to do what he has to do. I think he's going to do a fantastic job. But it's very tough for him. I know how tough it is for him. He's been having a hard time. And nobody would have any easy time. But I do believe he is doing the right thing.\nBoris is different. It's a different kind of a deal. Boris has to try and do something with Brexit. It's very tough. I deal with the EU. The EU is—that's a very, very strong group of people. They have their ideas, and they're not easy to deal with, I will tell you.\nWe've very close to making a deal, by the way, with the EU. I have to say this. We made a great deal with Japan. And we're very close to maybe making a deal with the EU. Because they don't want tariffs; it's very simple. They don't want to tax cars. Mercedes Benz, BMW, they don't need a 20-percent or a 25-percent tax. But we're very close. I think we're going to make a deal with the EU without having to go that route. I may have to go that route, but maybe not.\nWe're going to have a deal, a really fair deal. But the EU is another one. We've been losing $180 billion a year for many years. That's a lot of money. How much can you take out of the piggy bank, right?\nUnited Kingdom-U.S. Relations/Australia-U.S. Relations/British Exit From the European Union\nBoth. I don't want to say which. Look, I think that—I think that the—I think we have been with, I guess you would start off by saying, \"England.\" Right? You know, I ask Boris: \"Where's England? What's happening with England?\" They don't use it too much anymore. We talked about it. It was very interesting. But the United Kingdom is a great, incredible place. It's an incredible nation. And it's, you know, been one of our tremendous allies.\nAnd another one happens to be Australia. He was here also—Scott. He is fantastic. In fact, we're honoring him and Australia at the White House in a very short period of time.\nBut I think that—excuse me?\nAt some point, I will. Yes.\nAt some point, I will. Also, Germany. Angela asked me to visit Germany. We're going to be doing that too.\nSo I just think they're very different. And they're going to be going at it for a little while. But ultimately, probably, it works out. They may have to get out. They may not make a deal.\nThe European Union is very tough to make deals with. Very, very tough. Just ask Theresa May.\nGo ahead.\nThey understand that.\nWell, we actually had a very good meeting. I had it out with one or two people where we disagreed in terms of concept. But we actually had a pretty good meeting last year. I would say that this was a big step above, in terms of unity, in terms of agreement. And we have really great agreement on a lot of very important subjects. But last year was good also. I mean, last year was good also. I think last year might've been a little bit underrated, you know.\nGo ahead. Please.\nOh, we're going to do something, hopefully, special. We're going to build on what we have now. We've built on something really good. And we're going to be going in with some great unity. We really did. If there was any word for this particular meeting of seven very important countries, it was \"unity.\" I think, most important of all, we got along great. We got along great.\nGo ahead.\nChina-U.S. Trade Negotiations\nNo, I didn't say it. He did.\nYes.\nYes.\nThat was an easy answer. [Laughter]\nAbsolutely. Great respect for China. Great respect for the leadership of China. Absolutely.Q.Mr. President, can I follow up on——\nI haven't said that, but I think that having President Putin in what was the G-8—he was a member of the G-8, and I heard he was a good member of the G-8. Having him in, I think, is more of an advantage. I think it's a positive for the world. I think it's a positive for Russia. I think it's a big positive for Russia. And it's something the group is discussing. They are discussing it.\nPeople feel very much like me. Many people. What?\nWell, you know, we'll see. I know one thing: If they were invited back, I think they'd be there. If they weren't, that's okay too. I just think they'd be better inside than outside. I mean, as I said before, I really do; I think they'd be an asset. I think it would be a good thing.\nYou know, some of the things—we were going in the room, and yesterday, in particular, we were discussing four or five matters. And Russia was literally involved in all of those four or five matters. And a few of the people looked up and said, you know, \"Why aren't they here talking to us about it?\" And we go: \"What are we going to do now? Go home? Take it easy for a day?\" Although, I'm not doing that. I don't take it easy.\nBut what are we going to do? We're going to go home and start calling them at the end of the week and say, \"Hey, how about this?\" They could have been in the room.\nWe had numerous things that we were discussing. Right? Numerous. We had a lot of things that we were discussing, and it would've been very easy if Russia was in the room. If he was in the room, we could've solved those things. Now they're just in limbo. But I have to say, with all of that, very little in limbo.\nBut somebody will speak to him about some things, and frankly, they're not very complicated. But it would be easier if they were in the room. Okay?\nJosh, go ahead. Josh [Josh Dawsey, Washington Post].\nI feel that the United States has tremendous wealth. The wealth is under its feet. I've made that wealth come alive. We will soon be one of the—we will soon be exporting. In fact, we're actually doing it now—exporting.\nBut we are now the number one energy producer in the world. And soon, it will be by far, with a couple of pipelines that have not been able to get approved for many, many years. It will have a huge impact. I was able to get ANWR in Alaska. It could be the largest site in the world for oil and gas. I was able to get ANWR approved. Ronald Reagan wasn't able to do it. Nobody was able to do it. They've been trying to do it since before Ronald Reagan. I got it approved.\nWe're the number-one energy producer in the world. Soon it will be, by far, the number one. It's tremendous wealth. And LNG is being sought after all over Europe and all over the world, and we have more of it than anybody else. And I'm not going to lose that wealth. I'm not going lose it on dreams, on windmills, which, frankly, aren't working too well. I'm not going to lose it.\nSo, Josh, in a nutshell, I want the cleanest water on Earth. I want the cleanest air on Earth. And that's what we're doing. And I'm an environmentalist. You—a lot of people don't understand that. I have done more environmental impact statements, probably, than anybody that's—I guess I can say definitely, because I have done many, many, many of them. More than anybody that's ever been President or Vice President or anything even close to President. And I think I know more about the environment than most people.\nI want clean air. I want clean water. I want a wealthy country. I want a spectacular country with jobs, with pensions, with so many things. And that's what we're getting. So I want to be very careful. At the same time——\nAt the same time—at the same time—you weren't called.\nAt the same time, it's very important to me—very important to me—we have to maintain this incredible—this incredible place that we've all built. We've become a much richer country. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing—because that great wealth allows us to take care of people. We can take care of people that we couldn't have taken care of in the past because of the great wealth. We can't let that wealth be taken away. Clean air, clean water.\nThank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-biarritz-france"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia", "Date": "2019-09-20", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. Please. We had a spectacular morning, and it's an honor being with the Prime Minister and Mrs. Morrison. Thank you very much. Australia is a fantastic country and a brilliant ally. We just spent a lot of time together with our representatives, and they get along very well, and we're doing a lot of deals. And we talked military. We talked trade. We talked about everything you can talk about. And we came to the same conclusion, I think, in every case.\nBut I just want to say it's an honor having both of you here. Thank you very much. You have a truly great country, and I don't think we've ever had a better relationship than we have right now.\nAnd tonight we're going to have something very special in the Rose Garden. And based on all of that money we spend on all of that weather-predicting equipment, they're saying, \"No chance of rain.\" [Laughter] Let's see if that's right. If it is, we'll run right back into this room. [Laughter]\nBut we're going to have a fantastic evening. And, First Lady, thank you very much. You worked very hard on this. So it's not going to rain. It's going to be a beautiful evening. And great job. Really great job, honey.\nThank you. Please, Scott.\nWell, thank you very much, Scott. It's a great honor.\nGo ahead. Please.China-U.S. Trade/U.S. Tariff Structure on Chinese Imports/U.S. Economy/U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement\nNo.\nWe're looking for a complete deal. I'm not looking for a partial deal. China has been starting to buy our agricultural product—if you noticed over the last week—and actually, some very big purchases.\nBut that's not what I'm looking for; we're looking for the big deal. We've taken it to this level. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. China has devalued their currency, and they're putting out a lot of money into their economy. And they have a very bad economy right now, and I don't want them to have a bad economy. But it's the worst in, they say, 57 years. Two weeks ago, it was the worst in 22 years. Now it's 57 years, and it's only going to get worse. Their supply chain is being broken up very badly.\nAnd companies are leaving because they can't pay the 25—soon to go to 30—percent tariff. And we have 30 percent very shortly on $250 billion. We have another tariff at a slightly smaller number, as you know, on other—on about 300 billion dollars' worth of goods and products.\nSo they would like to do something. As you know, we're talking a little bit this week, talking a lot next week. And then, top people are going to be speaking the week following. But I'm not looking for a partial deal; I'm looking for a complete deal.\nNo. I don't think I need it before the election. I think people know that we're doing a great job. I've rebuilt the military. We've—Scott and I were talking about that. We spent 1½ trillion dollars. When I came in, our military was depleted. Frankly, we didn't have ammunition, okay? But our military was in very bad shape. We've rebuilt the military. We've got one of the strongest economies.\nMike Pence, actually, got some—who is right here. Our great Vice President. He was talking yesterday and he called me. He says, \"Boy, these numbers—these consumer numbers are incredible.\" The retail numbers that came out 2 days ago, that really weren't reported, were really—I mean, just incredible numbers. You know that very well. That's your world. And some other numbers.\nWe're doing very well. Our economy is very strong. And China is being affected very badly. We're not; we're not being affected. In fact, we're taking in many billions of dollars. And China is eating that. You know, China is eating the tariffs because of the devaluation. Now, that doesn't happen with all countries. China is China, and they know what they're doing as well as anybody.\nMy relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one, very good one. But we have, right now, a little spat. But I think we're doing very well.\nOur country is doing well. You look at so many different things. Look at all of the regulation cutting that allows us to do what we did. Look at what happens 3 days ago, where you have an attack like that and it takes out a big chunk of oil, and the prices go up $4, $5, and now it's heading down rapidly. That tells you—that would have happened years ago, it would have gone up $50. It would've doubled. And this was a blip.\nSo it's been really amazing what we've been able to do. I think the voters understand that. I don't think it has any impact on the election.\nNow, if something happened, I think that would probably be a positive for the election, but that's okay. I do think signing USMCA on a bipartisan basis with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and everybody else—very bipartisan—I think that's very important for our country. And I would certainly be willing to say that's a bipartisan deal.\nBut I think that's very important for our manufacturers, for our farmers. Even for unions, they want that deal done. And so, hopefully, that's going to be put up to a vote very soon. There will be very little cajoling of the Democrats, because most Democrats want it too.\nBut the USMCA is ready to be voted on. It's finished. Mexico has taken their final votes. Canada is willing to do that any time we want them too. They're all set to go. And we need that for all of the—we need that for our country. It's a great deal. It's a great deal.\nThank you.\nChina-U.S. Trade\nAnd we could do, Scott, a very big deal with China, and it could go very quickly, as you know. But it wouldn't be the appropriate deal. We have to do it right. And that's a very complicated deal, with intellectual property protection. We have to do that and other things. I could leave lots out and have a deal very quickly, but we want to do it right.\nI assume Andrew is a nice person? [Laughter] That's why you chose him?Australian Economy/China-U.S. Trade/Australia-U.S. Trade/Australia's Extractive Industries\nWell, first of all, you know, I look at numbers. I love numbers. And the numbers of Australia are doing incredibly well. You're doing unbelievably well.\nWhen we have a deal with China—or not—but when we have a deal with China—because they want to make it perhaps more than I want to make it. Because I actually love all the billions of dollars that's pouring into our Treasury. Billions and billions of dollars. We've never seen that before from China. It's always been the other way.\nBut when—and I'm taking care of our farmers out of that. We're helping our farmers. Our farmers were targeted, and they were targeted for $16 billion. And I made that up to them. We paid them the $16 billion and had tens of billions of dollars left over.\nSo I will say, though, that Australia is doing very well. If we do end up doing a deal, Australia will do even better. And we were discussing that. But Australia will be one of the big beneficiaries of a deal.\nAnd, in the meantime, as you know, I did tariff relief, with respect to a certain product in particular coming out of Australia. And that's something that we wouldn't do for anybody else. This has been a truly great ally, and we work very well together.\nBut you—your numbers are absolutely fantastic. Your economy is strong like ours. And I think we're two real examples of two countries doing extremely well. Some countries aren't doing so well.\nEurope is not doing well. Asia is not doing—large parts of Asia are not doing well. China is not doing well.\nAnd Australia has really been so focused on the economy. They do minerals. They have incredible wealth in minerals and coal and other things.\nAnd they are really at the leading edge of coal technology. It's clean coal. We call it \"clean coal,\" but it's also great for the workers. And things that would happen to—because it was very dangerous years ago and very bad for a lot of people. And you've rectified that 100 percent. It's incredible. I looked at your statistics the other day, and coal miners are very, very safe in Australia.\nIt's incredible what you've done. In fact, we're looking at what you've done. [Laughter] But so——\nSo I want to—I want to—we'll do a deal. We'll make a deal.\nYes.\nWell, these are the strongest sanctions ever put on a country. We are at a level of sanction that is far greater than ever before with respect to Iran. Today we did Central Bank, as you know. And we'll see. We'll see.\nThey're having a lot of problems, not only with us; they're having problems within their own country. And I think they have a lot of self-made problems.\nWe are, by far, the strongest military in the world. Going into Iran would be a very easy decision. As I said before, it'd be very easy. The easiest thing. Most people thought I would go in within 2 seconds, but plenty of time. Plenty of time.\nIn the meantime, they have a lot of problems within Iran. Iran could be a great country, could be a rich country. But they are choosing to go a different way. There'll be a point at which they'll be very sorry for that choice. But I think I'm showing great restraint. A lot of people respect it; some people don't. Some people say, \"Oh, you should go in immediately.\" And other people are so thrilled at what I'm doing. And I don't do it for anybody; I do it for what's good for the United States, what's good for our allies. And it's working out really, very well.\nAs far as Robert is concerned, he's—Robert, maybe you could stand up? Robert O'Brien is done a fantastic job for us with hostage negotiations. I think we can say that there has never been anybody that has done better than you and I as a combination. We've brought many people home, and we brought them home quickly. Speed is a very important thing, I find, with hostages. It's really something.\nI had dinner the other night with the Warmbier family, an incredible family—the whole family and some of Otto's friends, in addition to the family. We had 25 people over on Saturday night. And we did that dinner in Otto—really, in Otto's honor. And it was a beautiful thing. It was a beautiful thing.\nThe First Lady and I, it was very—you know, it was very touching and really very beautiful. We talked about Otto. And I will tell you that people should have moved faster. And Robert and I were talking about that. Should have moved faster. He was there for a long time.\nYou've got to move fast. With hostages, you have to move fast. All of a sudden, it gets very hard for the other side to do anything. And sometimes, it's just too late. In the case of Otto, it was very late. We got him home, but he was in horrible, horrible condition. What happened to him was actually incredible and just horrible.\nBut you have to move fast. Robert and I have been really successful. And the reason I know him so well—I actually work hard on hostages, I think he would say. I think most Presidents wouldn't do that, but I do. These are great—I guess, in almost all cases—American lives. And we help other people, also. We've also helped other countries with their hostage situation, where we have some strength that they don't.\nBut these are great people. And we get them home. We got them home from North Korea, as you know. And we got them home from a lot of different locations. Egypt—we got them home. We got them home from many different locations. Turkey. President Erdogan was very good. And we got a hostage home, who—our great pastor, who everyone in this room knows and loves.\nBut we've had tremendous success. And what's surprised me, I didn't know too many people knew Robert. And when it came time to pick somebody for the position—it's a very critical time—I had so many people—I shouldn't say this in front of Robert, he'll be embarrassed, but I had so many people that called me, and they recommended Robert O'Brien. So I think he's going to do a great job.\nAnd he was here—I can tell you this—he started about 12 minutes after he was chosen. He sat in with us. And he's very much involved now on what we're doing.\nIran/U.S. Military Readiness/U.S. Nuclear Arsenal/Australia-U.S. Trade/Australian Defense Spending\nWell, I don't want to talk about that, but I will say I think the sanctions work. And the military would work, but that's a very severe form of winning. But we win. Nobody can beat us, militarily. Nobody can even come close. What we've done for our military in the last 3 years is incredible. All made in the U.S.A., by the way. And it's really incredible. Our nuclear was getting very tired. They hadn't spent the money on it. And now we have it have it in, as we would say, \"tippy-top shape.\" Tippy-top. It's—we have new, and we have renovated, and it's incredible. And we all should pray that we never have to use it. We should never have to use it. And our military itself is in phenomenal shape.\nAnd we have a great gentleman, as you know, going to be taking over Joint Chiefs of Staff. Joe Dunford has been fantastic. He's a great, great man and a friend of mine. But General Milley is going to be taking over. And it's going to be—we're going to have a little bit of a celebration, both for Joe and for Mark—for everybody.\nAnd you know—as you know, our Secretary of Defense has just come in, Mark Esper. And he's been here for a short period of time, but he's got tremendous energy. He's got it. He knows it. That's what he's been doing for a long period of time, from the day he graduated, or maybe I should say from the day he started at West Point, where he was a top, top scholar, et cetera.\nSo we have a—we have an incredible people. And Steve Mnuchin is here. We did the sanctions today, and I think they're probably, Steve, the strongest that have ever been put on a country. We will certainly never do that to Australia, I promise you. [Laughter]\n——\"or it's about a hundred percent.\"\nIt's close to a hundred percent. And we make the best equipment. He understands that. But it's a real relationship. They buy a hundred percent of their military—and it's a massive purchase. And it's gotten bigger. I guess, you said the biggest purchase since World War II.\nYes.\nHold it one second. You'll get a second crack. You'll get a shot at your Prime Minister. [Laughter] I'm sure you're looking forward to it.\nWe didn't discuss too much Iran. We discussed more trade, more China. We discussed Afghanistan, where Australia is helping us. And we're slowly reducing in Afghanistan, as people know. We've been very effective in Afghanistan. And if we wanted to do a certain method of war, we would win that very quickly. But many, many, really, tens of millions of people would be killed. And we think it's unnecessary.\nBut they've been—Australia has been a great help to us in Afghanistan. But we're reducing in Afghanistan. We're reducing in Syria, where we had—you know, we've taken over 100 percent of the caliphate. We have 100 percent. When I came in, it was smaller, but it was a mess. It was all over. And now it's in a position.\nAnd I won't repeat what I said before, with the prisoners, but we have thousands of ISIS fighters from our work in capturing 100 percent of the caliphate. And we're asking the countries from where they came—whether it's Germany, or France, or other countries—to take those people back, put them on trial, do what they have to do with them. But the United States will not keep thousands and thousands of people for the next possibly 50 years of whatever it may be. It's going to be up to those countries. We did them a big favor. We went in. We took them down. The ISIS fighters, in the end, weren't very good fighters against the United States. But we have thousands of them, and we want them to be taken over by Germany, France, and all of those countries from where they came. Okay.\nWell, thank you very much. And, Jennifer, thank you very much. First Lady, thank you. And I hope you're going to be able to see tonight—to the media—because really it's going to be a beautiful evening in honor of Australia and the Morrisons. Thank you very much.\nThank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-scott-morrison-australia"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in New York City", "Date": "2019-09-25", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you.\nWell, thank you all for being here. We've had a tremendous 3 days in New York, at the United Nations. I want to thank the Secretary-General. It's been really incredible what's been taking place. And he's been a fantastic host to a lot of countries.\nThe meetings I had on a bilat, or close, were pretty staggering. I think we set a new record, but you'll have to check that out. The—we met very, very—for pretty extended periods of time, either two and two, one on one, or just about at that level, with Pakistan, Poland, New Zealand, Singapore, Egypt, South Korea, United Kingdom, India, Iraq, Argentina, Germany, Brazil, France, Japan, Ukraine, Honduras, El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, U.A.E., Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Other than that, we weren't too busy over the last 3 days.\nAnd unfortunately, the press doesn't even cover it. You know, we have—we've made some fantastic deals, like with Japan. For farmers, we have a tremendous trade deal with Japan. And that doesn't get covered because you waste your time on nonsense.\nThe PMI manufacturers' index has gone substantially up, which was an incredible—Larry Kudlow, wherever you may be—Larry, please stand up. He just gave me these numbers. And existing new home sales are through the roof. Just came out. Oil prices have gone down ever since the Saudi Arabia incident, and they've gone down very substantially. So we have plenty of oil. But those numbers were surprising to you, Larry. And the extent of the increase. Is that a correct statement? So thank you, Larry Kudlow.\nWe think we'll make this little announcement to you because—important. You know the so-called whistleblower? The one that didn't have any first-class, or first-rate, or second-tier information, from what I understand. You'll have to figure that out for yourself. But I've spoken with Leader Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans—many of them—and we were going to do this anyway, but I've informed them—all of the House Members—that I fully support transparency on the so-called whistleblower information, even though it was supposedly second-hand information, which is sort of interesting.\nAnd other things have come out about the whistleblower that are also maybe even more interesting. But also insist on transparency from Joe Biden and his son Hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily taken out of Ukraine and China—millions of dollars—millions and millions of dollars taken out very rapidly while he was Vice President. And I think they should have transparency for that. I've informed the leader about that.\nAnd additionally, I demand transparency from Democrats who went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President, who I met and is an outstanding person. I just met a little while ago; some of you were there. I think he's going to be outstanding. He got elected on the basis of corruption. He wants to end corruption in Ukraine, and I think that's great.\nBut they went there, and they wanted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat. They threatened him if he didn't do things. Now, that's what they're accusing me of, but I didn't do it. I didn't threaten anybody. In fact, the press was asking questions of the President of Ukraine. And he said, \"No pressure.\" I used the word \"pressure.\" I think he used the word \"push,\" but he meant pressure, but it's the same thing. No push, no pressure, no nothing. It's all a hoax, folks. It's all a big hoax.\nAnd the sad thing about this hoax is that we work so hard with all of these countries, and I mean really hard. This has been—I've been up from early in the morning to late in the evening, and meeting with different countries all for the good of our country, and the press doesn't even cover all of this. And it's disappearing—it's really disappointing also to those countries that are with us and spend so much time with us.\nSo we want transparency. We've informed Kevin McCarthy about transparency. And we said, \"Vote for it.\" So I think you'll have close to a hundred percent of the Republican votes, I hope.\nAnd it got almost no attention, but in May, CNN reported that Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durbin, and Patrick Leahy wrote a letter to Ukraine's Prosecutor General expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were \"critical.\" In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing, they wouldn't get any assistance. Gee, doesn't that sound familiar? Doesn't that sound familiar?\nAnd Chris Murphy—who I've been dealing with on guns—you know, so nice. He's always: \"Oh, no, we want to work it out. We want to work it out.\" But they're too busy wasting their time on the witch hunt. So Senator Chris Murphy literally threatened the President of Ukraine that, if he doesn't do things right, they won't have Democrat support in Congress. So you're going to look all of this up.\nOne other thing—I'm just going off of certain notes and elements of what we've been doing over the last 3 days, but this just came up a few minutes ago: The \"Amazon-Washington Post\" just put out a fake article that Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire—who I've gotten to know, and he's a tough cookie—and I was surprised; I was shocked to hear this—was going to quit, blaming the White House for something that they wouldn't let him talk openly, freely. And I was shocked, because I know Joe, and he's tough. A tough guy.\nAnd I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit. Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement—I didn't speak to Joe yet—but he said, \"At no time have I considered resigning my position.\" In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake.\n\"At no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on August 16, 2019. I have never quit anything in my life, and I am not going to start now. I'm committed to leading the intelligence community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our Nation.\" That's from the Acting Director of National Intelligence, a very good man, Joseph Maguire.\nSo we're having a great period of time. Our country is the strongest it's ever been economically. Our numbers are phenomenal. Wilbur, thank you. And Larry. Everybody. The numbers are phenomenal. Our economy is the strongest in the world. We're the largest economy in the world.\nHad my opponent won, we would be second right now, because China was catching us so rapidly, we would've been second by this time. And unless somebody does a very poor job as President, we're going to be first for a long way, because we've picked up trillions and trillions of dollars in value and worth of our country, and China has lost trillions and trillions of dollars and millions of jobs and their supply chain. And they want to make a deal. This year, America came to the United Nations stronger than we have ever been before: Since my election, the United States has not only brought our economy to a level that we have never seen, the most jobs that we've ever had—you know; you've heard me say it many times—African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. And the most and best employment numbers: 160 million—very close to that number—in jobs. We've never been anywhere close.\nWages are up, and inequality is down. Something that people don't like writing about. But wages are up. I used to speak during the campaign, and I'd talk about wages where people were making less money 3 years ago than they were making 21 years, 22 years ago, and they'd have two jobs and three jobs. When I say \"3 years ago,\" I'm talking into the area sometime prior to the election. And they were doing very badly. And now, for the first time in many years, wages are up and employment is up, and unemployment is down. And it's a beautiful thing to watch.\nIn a week of active and ambitious diplomacy here at the United Nations, America renewed our friendships. We advanced our values greatly and made clear to everyone that the United States will always defend our citizens to promote prosperity.\nI met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, at length, of the United Kingdom, continuing our discussions on a magnificent, new bilateral trade deal. So we'll see what happens with respect to Brexit, but I suspect we'll have a fantastic deal with the U.K. It should be much bigger than it has been over the last number of years. Over the last 20 years, frankly. It should be a much bigger deal.\nThat's true with many countries. We're going to have much bigger trade deals with a lot of countries that have an opportunity to come. And they all want to do business with the United States, especially now.\nEarlier today I stood alongside Prime Minister Abe of Japan—a friend of mine, a great gentleman—had a great reelection. And we signed a terrific new trade deal, which tremendously helps our farmers and ranchers and technology. The technology companies are really big beneficiaries.\nWe also held very productive conversations with leaders of Pakistan, India. And many other nations are achieving stronger ties of fair and reciprocal trade. And with respect to Pakistan and India, we talked about Kashmir. And whatever help I can be, I said—I offered, whether it's arbitration or mediation, or whatever it has to be, I'll do whatever I can. Because they're at very serious odds right now, and hopefully, that'll get better.\nYou look at the two gentlemen heading those two countries—two good friends of mine—I said: \"Fellas, work it out. Just work it out.\" Those are two nuclear countries. They've got to work it out.\nThis week, we also made incredible strides on national security. With President Duda of Poland, we signed a joint declaration advancing defense cooperation. And crucially, Poland has agreed to put up 100 percent of the money, something I don't think you've ever heard said before. But they're going to put up a hundred percent of the money, of hosting additional U.S. military personnel that we'll be taking from various other countries. We won't have more over; we'll have—we'll be moving them around.\nPoland is building us phenomenal new facilities. They're spending everything, and they're going to really do a job. But we'll be moving a few thousand soldiers, and Poland will be paying that—for it.\nTogether with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore, I signed an important agreement extending our defense cooperation. This hasn't been changed in many years. Then, yesterday I met with prospective members of the Middle East Strategic Alliance, which is a group that I know very well; I know all of them. And through this effort, the nations of the Middle East are taking more responsibility for securing their own future and their own neighborhood. And they're also reimbursing us and paying us for a lot of the military work that we incredibly do.\nBut because we're now independent, energy-wise—we're energy independent—we have very few boats going over the Middle East. We used to have them going through the Straits all the time. And you probably noticed that, every once in a while, they go after somebody else's. They haven't gone after ours yet. If they do, they've get big problems. But we have very few boats going over there. They were saying the other day, they've never attacked an American boat. And I'm not asking for trouble, but if they do, they know they have far bigger trouble. But then, they said, \"But you know, we don't see very many American boats over here anymore.\"\nThis week also brought extraordinary progress to nations of our own hemisphere. In recent days, we've achieved historic asylum cooperation agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We were with El Salvador today. A great young gentleman became the President. He's strong and tough, and he's taking care of crime. He was really something today. I was very impressed with him. And likewise with Honduras, who we met. We signed a cooperation agreement with both, and also with Guatemala.\nWe're working with our partners in Central America to ensure that asylum-seekers can pursue relief as close to their home countries as possible. That will make a tremendous difference at our southern border.\nAnd Mexico—I have to say, President López Obrador has been outstanding—and our standing partner. And he's doing a great job in Mexico. The cartels are way down, and the numbers—our Secretary is here now—the numbers are way down. Way, way down. And we're doing that without the help of Congress, meaning the Democrats in Congress who won't give us a single vote to take care of loopholes.\nWe have loopholes that are so horrible, and it would be so easy to fix. And they know they should be fixed, but they don't want to do it, because they don't want to give Trump any credit, because it's all about the election. That's all they care about. They don't care about our country; they care about the election.\nAnd the sad part is, with all of the tremendous work that we've done this weekend—whether it's Secretary Mnuchin or Secretary Pompeo, who had some outstanding, outstanding meetings—with all of this tremendous work that we've done, the press doesn't even cover it. And the Democrats did this hoax during the United Nations week. It was perfect. Because this way, it takes away from these tremendous achievements that we're taking care of doing, that we're involved in in New York City at the United Nations.\nSo that was all planned, like everything else. It was all planned. And the witch hunt continues, but they're getting hit hard in this witch hunt, because when they look at the information, it's a joke. Impeachment? For that? When you have a wonderful meeting, or you have a wonderful phone conversation?\nI think you should ask. We actually—you know, that was the second conversation. I think you should ask for the first conversation also. I can't believe they haven't, although I heard there's a—there's a rumor out they want the first conversation. It was beautiful. It was just a perfect conversation.\nBut I think you should do that. I think you should do, and I think you should ask for VP Pence's conversation, because he had a couple conversations also. I can save you a lot of time. They're all perfect. Nothing was mentioned of any import other than congratulations. But the word is that they're going to ask for the first phone conversation. You can have it anytime you need it. And also Mike Pence's conversations, which were, I think, one or two of them. They were perfect. They were all perfect.\nIt's very sad what the Democrats are doing to this country. They're dividing, they're belittling, they're demeaning our country. So many leaders came up to me today, and they said: \"Sir, what you go through, no President has ever gone through. And it's so bad for your country.\" People laugh at the stupidity of what they've asked for. And here we could do asylum. We could do all of these different things so easily. We could do asylum quickly. We could do loopholes, get rid of them.\nInstead, we actually made deals with Mexico and with Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. And we're doing it with them instead of with our Congress, but we're doing it. We get it done.\nThe wall is being built, by the way. It got little coverage. I went to the border. It's going up in New Mexico. It's going up in Arizona. It's going up in California, believe it or not. They really wanted that wall in California, in San Diego. As soon as it was completed, they said, \"We don't want a wall.\" They were begging me for a wall. I should take it out and move it to another location.\nWe were with the Governor—spoke to him a lot—but the Governor of Texas, Lieutenant Governor of Texas, attorney general of Texas, the Senators of Texas—Cornyn, Ted Cruz. And we're building an incredible wall. That's going to—number one, it's going to look great. It's going to be virtually impossible to cross unless you're one hell of a mountain climber. It's very tough. It's going to be very tough to get people and drugs over those walls, because they're the real deal.\nI went to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and he got all his people together. I said: \"Give me four walls, your optimum. Every single thing included.\" And they give me 20-percent less, 20-percent less, and 20-percent less—meaning, less cost. They came back, they said: \"This is the wall, sir. This would be the best.\" We have the panels on top, which are anticlimb panels. I don't know if you noticed the steel on top. We have a different design for a different area, but this anticlimb is very tough. They've—we had people going out—and real climbers—telling us which is the toughest to climb. But these are anticlimb panels. Very tough to get across.\nAnd the wall is going up, many miles a week. And we hope to have over 400, but maybe as much as 500 miles, which we'll pretty much do it, because you have a lot of natural barriers; you have mountains, you have really rough rivers. You have some really rough land that you can't cross very easily. So they serve as their natural walls. But we—we'll have, we think, over 400, but we could even have 500 miles.\nTo combat the malice and corruption of both the Venezuelan and Iranian dictatorships, today I issued proclamations suspending the entry into the United States of senior regime officials and their families.\nAnd further, to promote American values, on Monday I was proud to be the first President in history to host a meeting at the United Nations—I'm so surprised; first President for this. I can't believe that I'm first. I spoke to Franklin Graham about that. I can't believe it—at the United Nations, on protecting religious freedom and liberty for people around the world.\nWhile some partisans and unelected bureaucrats in Washington may choose to fight every day against the interests and beliefs of the American people, my administration is standing up for the American people like no administration has in many, many years. You forgot the American people. You totally forgot the American people. This week, every—every week, I really can say—of my Presidency, we're standing up for American prosperity, American security, and the American way of life. And together, with our friends and partners, we're building a more peaceful, prosperous, and promising future.\nWe have a tremendous relationship now with a lot of nations that are very happy with what's going on, and that includes in South America, where they've been so helpful, where nobody thought this would be possible. The relationship with Mexico is an example, or El Salvador, or Honduras, or Guatemala. Nobody even knew about it. Yet we sent them hundreds of millions of dollars, and all we got back was caravans of people pouring in.\nWe had tremendous—we had tremendous—it was terrible. And we've got that stopped, and the countries are now helping us. And we stopped those payments, by the way. We don't pay those countries that money anymore. But I will tell you, if they're as good as they seem to be—and they're really doing a job on crime and stopping the wrong people from leaving and coming to the United States—we'll be helping them a lot with economic development projects and other things.\nSo, with that, we had a tremendous 3 days. It was beautiful to see. Made a lot of new friends. I read you a list of all the countries I saw pretty much one on one. And it's been very busy, but it's been very, very fruitful.\nSo we could take a couple of questions. I'd love some questions on some of the things that we accomplished at UNGA, instead of the witch hunt—the phony witch hunt questions, which I know that's what you want to ask, because it's probably better for you, but it's not better for the country.\nSo maybe we'll take a few questions. Please.\nInvestigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Corruption Issues in Ukraine/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine\nYes. Well, that's what he did, isn't it, really? When you think about it.\nLook, that whole witch hunt was started, and hopefully, that'll all come out. But there's been some fantastic books written that just came out—whether you will look at Gregg Jarrett, or McCarthy's book that just came out recently, and so many other books. I mean, a lot of books are coming out. When you start reading those books, you see what they did to us. What they've done to this country is a disgrace. They've hurt this country very badly. And no other President should have to go through what I've gone through.\nThe President—the new President of Ukraine is looking to stop corruption. There's a lot of corruption going on, and there was corruption. I just told you about Senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things. That's really what people are trying to say that I did, but the only difference is, I didn't do it. You take a look at that call; it was perfect. I didn't do it. There was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden, and there was with these Senators. And they threatened. They said: \"You do this, you do that. We're not going to give you votes.\" That's—that's the real deal. So we have an honest group of people that have been maligned. And you know, it's—a lot of people say I'll do even better. I'm very happy. Yesterday, I guess, we had a 53 poll, and a lot of people say add 10 points to anything. Anybody voting for Trump, you can add—anytime you get a poll, you can add 10 points or 7 points or 6 points. Take it any way you want. But I don't know if I consider that to be a compliment, but in one way, it is a compliment.\nAnd I guess that's what happened in the last election: Far more people came to vote than anybody thought possible.\nWell, I think you can look at your Senators and you can look at Biden, and you can look at all these other people. But what we're looking for is corruption. An investigation started, called the \"Russian witch hunt,\" affectionately. And it was a total phony scam. It was set up by people within the Government to try and stop somebody from getting elected.\nAnd after that person—namely, me—won, and convincingly won at 306 to 223 in the electoral college—which, by the way, when you run a race, if you're running electoral—you know, if you go by the college, electoral college, that's a much different race than running popular vote. And it's like the hundred-yard dash or the mile. You train differently.\nAnd I can't help it that my opponent didn't go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places. But that's the way it is. We won an election convincingly. Convincingly. And then, you had the text message on, \"Well, if she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy.\" How bad was that? You know the insurance policy? That's sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years, the insurance policy.\nNo, there are a lot of very dishonest people. We're the ones that played it straight. And you know what? The millions of people out there that are looking at what's going on, those people understand it. They see it. And they think it's disgusting. And our people are being hurt, and our country is being hurt.\nWhen a Nancy Pelosi allows her position to be taken over by radical far-left Socialists, or worse, that's pretty bad. That's pretty bad, especially when the Senators and all of these other people have actually done what they're accusing me of doing, which I didn't do.\nI'm going to have Mike Pompeo say a couple of words. I'm going to have Steve Mnuchin say a couple of words. And then, we'll do a couple of more questions.\nSecretary of State Michael R. Pompeo.Mr. President, I thought I'd start by talking about Iran. We had a productive week. We saw the Europeans take a position with respect to the attacks that took place in Saudi Arabia, making clear this was Iran, just as President Trump and I had been saying, and have now joined us in saying that the existing JCPOA framework is just not going to work. It's not going to solve the world's problems, it's not going to create Middle East stability.\nThen, we had a good set of meetings with our Middle East allies as well. The President joined for a meeting of the GCC where we talked again about how we can help deter. We want peace. We want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic of Iran. We're hoping we can get that way. In the end, it will be up to the Iranians to make that decision, whether they'll choose violence and hate and—as the President said in his speech yesterday to the General Assembly—if their bloodthirst will continue.\nWe hope that's the—[inaudible]. We hope we can get the opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that's good for both of them, for the United States, to make sure that they never have a nuclear weapon and that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles and in the way they have all around the world. And I think we made real progress uniting the world on that here over these past few days. Thank you.\nThank you, Mike.\nSecretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin.As Secretary Pompeo said, on Iran, we had very good discussions with all of our allies about the sanctions program, which is the maximum pressure, and unity on the sanctions program. The Europeans made it very clear they would not do anything without our consent.\nAnd then, on the economic front, we had the entire economic team here for all the meetings: Secretary Ross, Larry Kudlow; Ambassador Lighthizer just left to go back to DC. He's working hard on trying to get USMCA passed. But we had a lot of productive discussions. The Japanese trade deal and a lot of discussions on investing in the U.S., more jobs in the U.S., and more trade. Thank you.\nOkay. Go ahead, please.\nChina-U.S. Trade/U.S. Tariff Structure on Chinese Imports/Agricultural Exports\nI know.\nNot anymore, maybe.\nAnd maybe they just say that, Kristina.\nOh, I just think it's progressing. I think they want to make a deal. They're losing their supply chain. You know, it's getting killed.\nWell, I don't want to say that. But I can tell you that these two men—and in this case, more specifically, Steve—were having some very good conversations.\nAnd I guess it's next week that a group is coming in and the week after.\nSo we have a lot of talks going on and also by telephone.\nThey want to make a deal. And you know why they want to make a deal? Because they're losing their jobs and because their supply chain is going to hell. And companies are moving out of China, and they're moving to lots of other places, including the United States. And that's not good; that's far worse than they thought.\nAnd by the way, in the meantime, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. We're taking in tremendous numbers in tariffs. And we're helping our farmers who got targeted. Now, by the way, China is starting to buy our agricultural product again. They're starting to go with the beef and all of the different things—pork. Very big on pork.\nBut if you look and if you see—and they actually put out, I think, a statement. But they're starting, very heavy, to buy our ag again. No, they want to make a deal. And they should want to make a deal. The question is: Do we want to make a deal?\nWell, that would be a shame. Well, I don't want to answer that question, but you know how I feel about NAFTA. I think NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made, although I also happen to think World Trade Organization was not one of the greats. Not one of the greats. That was the creation of China, which went like a rocket ship from the day they signed. It was—it was terrible.\nBut no, we're going to find out. That's going to be a very interesting question, with Nancy and Chuck and all of these people focusing on the witch hunt because they can't beat us at the ballot. They can't beat us at the ballot. And they're not going to win the President. We're having great polls. We have internal polls that are—Ohio, Iowa. Pennsylvania is looking good. North Carolina.\nWe just won two races that a lot of people—we thought we were going to lose both of those races. One was down 17 points 3 weeks before the race, and he ended up winning by a substantial margin—by a substantial margin. And—Dan Bishop. And then, we had a second race, as you know, and he was up one or two points and ended up winning by—what was it? Twenty-five points or some incredible—I'll ask you folks, because I don't want to be inaccurate. Otherwise, I'll have a front-page story: \"We have breaking news. Trump exaggerated.\"\nBut he won by many, many points. And he was leading by maybe two, maybe three, but he won by—in the twenties. So it's—it's been—so we're looking great in North Carolina, looking great in Florida.\nAnd you had one or two Congressmen, Democrats, say, \"Listen, we can't beat them at the election, so let's impeach him.\" Right? Didn't you hear—Al Green. That's a beauty. He's a real beauty, that guy. But he said, very distinctively, it's all—it was all over the place. I don't know—they're trying to lose that tape, I guess. But he said, \"We can't . . .\" Essentially, he said: \"We can't beat him. Let's impeach him.\" That's pretty dangerous stuff.\nSteve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], go ahead.\nYes. I don't like it.\nBecause I was getting such fake news, and I just thought it would be better. And now they're asking for the first phone conversation, and I'll release that too, if it's important to you. But they're asking for—because I had a conversation previous—on a previous election plateau that he had hit. The—the current President hit a couple of different plateaus. And I spoke to him, previous to the call that we released, which was a very innocent call—very, very innocent—very nice call. And as he said, we were—\"I wasn't pushed. I wasn't pushed,\" meaning pressured. He wasn't pressured at all.\nBut I don't like the concept of releasing calls because when a President or Prime Minister, or a King or a Queen, calls the United States, you don't like to say, \"Gee, we're going to release your call to the fake-news media, and they're going to make you look like a fool.\" What happens is, it's hard to do business that way. You want to have people feel comfortable.\nSo I hated it, but you folks were saying such lies, such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice. In fact, Lindsey Graham said to me, when he read it—it was very interesting. He's a good man. He's a smart man. He said: \"I can't believe it. I never knew you could be this, really, nice to a person.\" He said: \"I cannot believe it. You were so nice. I didn't think you had that in you to be so nice.\"\nI was nice. I'm nice to a lot of people. People don't understand that. But I was. But he was shocked that it was such a nice call. There——\nHe said, \"There is nothing here.\" And all fair people say the same thing.\nBut I don't like the precedent, Steve. I don't like it where you're dealing with heads of state and to think that their call is going to be released. But I felt that—and you know, we spoke to Ukraine about it. Mike actually called up his counterpart, and we spoke to Ukraine about it, because we want to—because they could have been—if that they didn't want us to do it, we would not have done it.\nBut he actually said: \"That was a very innocent call. You can release it all you want.\"\nInvestigation Into Russia's Interference in 2016 Presidential Election/Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./News Media\nWell, I thought we won. I thought it was dead. It was dead. The Mueller report—no obstruction, no collusion. You look at all of the things that happened.\nCorey Lewandowski was fantastic the other day, as a person that they have been tormenting. You look at all the people that they've tormented, all the legal fees. People came here with bright eyes; they wanted to make life so great for other people. And they left where they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees that they didn't have. And it's a sad thing. What these Democrats have done to ruin lives is so sad.\nI've seen people with only good intention. They came to Washington because they wanted to make the United States and the world a better place. And they went home; they were dark. They got hit by Mueller's subpoenas. I think there were 2,500 subpoenas or some ridiculous number. Five hundred people were interviewed, and yet they don't interview Joe Biden and his son.\nIf you're Democrat, you have automatic protection. That's years and years of people putting in certain people into positions. But when you look at all of the—all of the trauma that these fakers, of course—and the press—look, the press is—much of the press is not only fake, it's corrupt. These stories they write are corrupt; they're so wrong. And they know that.\nYou know, it used to be—I used to get great press until I ran for politics. I mean, I used to be the king of getting good press. I was very good at it. And I got good. I mean, they covered me well for what—otherwise, I probably wouldn't be here. And once I ran, I said, \"Boy, this is incredible.\" But if you see the way they treat my family—used to be treated great. My family worked so hard. The people that work with me—these people—all of these people, they work so hard. They've done such a good—look, we have the greatest economy we've ever had. We have a military—$2½ trillion. We've rebuilt our military. You don't hear the vets complaining. We got choice approved. It couldn't be approved.\nBut when you see what happened with the viciousness, and when you see little Adam Schiff go out and lie and lie and stand at the mike—smart guy, by the way—stand at the mike and act like he's so serious. And then, he goes into a room with Nadler, and they must laugh their asses off. They must laugh their asses off.\nBut it's so bad for our country. People have said—Rush Limbaugh—great man; Sean Hannity said it. A lot of people have said it. Mark Levin. They said they don't know if one man anywhere in the world, with all the men they know—or woman—that could handle what I've had to handle. And I think that's true, but I handle it. To me, it's like putting on a suit.\nAll right, how about one more question? A question on the economy. A question on the economy.\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nGood. Good. Wow.\nHow are you doing?\nHow are you doing over there?\nYes. I would say \"pretty bad.\" Yes. Sad.\nAnd it was one of the great countries and one of the richest countries not so long ago—15 years ago. It's incredible.\nRight. I agree with that. And we're helping you.\nWe're helping you.\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead.\nWell, I just say that socialism will never happen in the United States. It can't happen in the United States. And Venezuela—unfortunately, I have to use your country as the example of what socialism can do, how it can tear the fabric of a country apart. Because I know a lot about Venezuela.\nI've had many, many friends of mine come from Venezuela. They live—many in Miami—a certain section of Miami, I won't mention the name, because they'll say I'm thinking about my business, and I'm not. But they are fantastic people, and they like your President. They voted overwhelmingly for me. They like what I'm doing for Venezuela.\nWe have Venezuela very much in our hearts and very much in our sights. And we're watching it very carefully. And you know what I would say? We're giving millions and millions of dollars in aid—not that we want to, from the Maduro standpoint, but we have to because, on a humanitarian—people are dying. They have no food. They have no water. They have no nothing. They're dying. No medicine. Their hospitals are closed or—or don't even have electricity. It's so sad to see.\nLet me just say that we have it under control. We are watching it very carefully. And we're going to be very, very——\nWe're—we're watching it very carefully, including other countries that may or may not be playing games. We're watching it very closely.\nJust put this in the back of your mind: It's all going to be fine. We know everything that you said, and it's all going to be fine. We're very much involved. We very much know what's going on, and we're very much involved. Okay?\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-new-york-city-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Sauli Niinistö of Finland", "Date": "2019-10-02", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Look at all the press that you attract. Do you believe this? That's very impressive.\nPresident Niinistö.I guess they are not after me. [Laughter]\nHuh? [Laughter] I hope not. You're lucky.\nThank you very much. Today it's my honor to welcome President Niinistö of Finland to the White House. And, Mr. President, it's wonderful to host you once again in Washington. We've gotten to know each other over the last period of time, and it's been a great experience.\nThe President and I have just concluded very productive discussions on a number of exciting opportunities for our two nations.\nBefore going further, I want to express our deep condolences over the horrific stabbing attack that took place yesterday at a college in Finland. America is praying for the victims and their families, and we send our unwavering love and support.\nPresident Niinistö.Thank you.\nThe American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America's recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919. As President Wilson wrote at the time, our recognition was \"prompted by [the] sympathies for a cause similar to that which caused our own Declaration of Independence in 1776.\"\nA century after we established diplomatic relations, the United States and Finland remain united by those same cherished values. Central to this effort is our nations' close cooperation on matters of security and defense. Although Finland is not a member of NATO—you save a lot of money—[laughter]—Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises. And I'm pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget.\nAmerica and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic. Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region free from external intrusion, interference, and coercion. Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic. And, as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don't like it. And we can't let it happen, and we won't let it happen.\nThe United States and Finland are likewise partnering to ensure the security of 5G networks. It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains. We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland. Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that. This innovation center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G.\nWe're also glad that the Finnish company Nokia—it's a great company—a global leader in 5G technology, is developing its cutting-edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey. Across the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion. Each year, Finnish-owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America and expand our exports by more than $1 billion. Just today Finnish Nokian Tyres opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee, a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brandnew, beautiful jobs for a great State: Tennessee. We love Tennessee. So they made a wise choice.\nPresident Niinistö.Thank you.\nYou never lose when you go to Tennessee.\nI encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States. There has simply never been a better time to do business in America. We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts, in the history of country. We slashed business tax. And we're fueling job growth through our record-setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible, unnecessary regulations. We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn't need, and we got rid of them.\nThe American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level in more than half a century. We want Finnish companies to join in America's extraordinary economic revival. So many countries are coming in. It's the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world, and it's the hot place to be. They all want to be here.\nThe President and I are also working on a way to improve international trade based on the principle of fairness and—my favorite word—reciprocity. I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating Presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union. We're going to have to start doing something with the European Union, because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years. And they know it. And I tell them, and they know it.\nAmerica's trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years. Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States. We also appreciate Finland's strong partnership in combating predatory trade practices worldwide, including the theft of intellectual property.\nFrom trade to security, from travel to commerce, we are immensely grateful for our close and deeply valued friendship with the people of Finland. Great people. And we're now working on a deal to sell a large number of airplanes, fighter jets, hopefully to Finland. We'll see how that works out. But we make the greatest jets in the world. We make the greatest missiles and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nobody is even close.\nPlease.\nPresident Niinistö.——Finnish people. They do appreciate that. Thank you.\nLadies and gentlemen, before meeting, I had some spare time, so I visited a couple of museums here—Museum of American History, Museum of American African History, and Museum of American Indian History. And in addition to that, I had a possibility of attending ceremony in Arlington. Mr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on. We were—we had a very good discussion with the President. Like you mentioned, our diplomatic relations are a hundred years old. During that time, we have developed our cooperation a lot, not only in official meetings like this, but American and Finnish people, scientists, for example, need each other cooperating, working together.\nWe have quite a lot of cooperation in security sector also, in defense, because I think that we share the feeling that the most important thing for the nation is to guarantee security to its citizens. And that is the starting point for Finland, also, to this cooperation.\nI wanted to take up with the President the importance of transatlantic cooperation. Well, we all know Europe needs U.S.A. But I say that U.S.A. needs also Europe. We know the price of everything. We should recognize also the value of everything. We share the same values: democracy, human rights, rule-based order. And in that, we are very similar.\nEurope has, in a way, awakened during the couple last years to understand also more about security point of view. And I just want to tell you that, in my opinion, the stronger Europe you have, the stronger partner you have.\nThe Arctic area—you know Finland is in very north—is becoming more and more interesting, like the President said. We both, alongside with six countries, form the Arctic Council. And we are working heavily. There are, surely, possibilities. Like we have heard, the maritime routes are being opened. Maybe there are also resources, but there are huge risks. One of them is that we should keep the low tension we are used to have there. And that is what we have been discussing, and I do appreciate President's position to emphasize that. It is not a place for military.\nBut an even greater challenge is the environment, and I'm very glad that we started to talk 2 years ago in this very house about black coal. It is not, maybe, the worst which causes climate problems, but it is—everybody can understand that if black comes down to ice and to snow, when the sun meets it, it melts down. And melting of sea ice in Arctic is very crucial. I used to say that if we lose the Arctic, we lose the globe.\nWe had a couple of words—very important ones—on arms control. We—some of us remember the worst years of cold war in 1960s. There was no agreement at all, just cold war. We can't let the situation return, no agreement at all about arms control. And that is why it is important to try to negotiate new agreements and to continue the New START agreement. That will be a good new start for international cooperation on that.\nTo end up with—you, Mr. President, referred to 5G, EU's use of ICT as a whole. We are very proud to have the excellence of—the Centre of Excellence of Hybrid in Helsinki. U.S.A. has been very helpful in that. Very many countries are working there together to fight against the future danger of hybrid warfare.\nWhat comes to providers in that area, I am not very willing to point out any country or company here now. It may be a bit late from U.S.A., in EU, making a risk assessment. It will be prepared in 1, 2 weeks' time. And after that, we are in a place that we have to choose the tools to protect us.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nBefore we take questions, something happened that's been—it's been going on for many decades, and we came to a conclusion. Could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second and explain the importance of what just took place? [Laughter] Because this has been going on for——\nPresident Niinistö.Quite a while.\n——many, many years. And this is Ambassador Pence. No relationship to our great Vice President. Hard to believe. Nobody believes that, but that's true. [Laughter]\nPresident Niinistö.That was one. One.\nRight?\nThank you. Fantastic job. Thank you. Be careful.\nThank you. That's a great job, Mr. Ambassador. That's been going on for many, many decades. So I just want to thank you. Outstanding.\nJohn Roberts [Fox News].\nImpeachment Inquiry in the House of Representatives/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/Intelligence Community Whistleblower/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election\nWell, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what's been playing out, John, for the last—since my election, I would say. If you wanted—probably, we'll find out soon, but probably even before my election.\nThis is a fraudulent crime on the American people. But we'll work together with Shifty Schiff and Pelosi and all of them, and we'll see what happens, because we did absolutely—I had a great call with the President of Ukraine. It was a hundred percent. You have the transcript. And then, Schiff went up, and he got—as the chairman of the committee, he got up and related a call that didn't take place. He made up the language. I—hard to believe. Nobody has ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.\nBut he went up to the microphone, and he read a statement from the President of the United States as if I were on the call, because what happened is, when he looked at the sheet—which was an exact transcript of my call, done by very talented people that do this—exact, word for word—he said, \"Wow, he didn't do anything wrong.\" So he made it up. He went up to a microphone, and, in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out, and he gave a whole presentation of words that the President of the United States never said. It has to be a criminal act. It has to be. And he should resign. And some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing.\nAnd just so you know, the call was perfect, the real call; the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because, usually, when I speak to foreign country leaders—you can name any one of them—but when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies. My knowledge—I know all about it. And so this isn't something like: \"Oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret.\" This is many people on the line. I don't even know how many. We'll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. He didn't say anything. He just—because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.\nBut the President of Ukraine, at the United Nations the other day—and previous to that—he announced through his spokesperson—said there was absolutely no pressure put on him. There was no quid pro quo, at all. And if you look at this whistleblower's—which I have a lot of respect for whistleblowers, but only when they're real—his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.\nBut what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call. Because I don't like doing that. I don't want to do it. I hope I don't have to do it again: release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don't want to do that, John. I don't want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian Government. We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them, \"Would it be okay?\" Otherwise, I couldn't have done it.\nAnd if I wouldn't have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report—didn't he say, seven or eight times, I said \"quid pro quo\"? In other words, \"You're going to do this or you're not going to get money.\"\nNow, in all fairness—Biden said it, and he's on tape. In all fairness, you have at least four United States Senators—Democrats—that said it. And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it.\nObama, when he was dealing with the President of Russia—not Putin—he said, \"Hey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election.\" You remember that? You didn't make a big deal out of that. Everybody thought: \"Oh, isn't that cute? Isn't that cute?\" My talk and my response—Lindsey Graham said, \"I never knew you were that nice. I can't believe you were that nice.\" He said that loud and clear. It was perfect. It was perfect. Not a thing wrong with it.\nTo impeach a President over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to win an election in 2020—which they won't—is incredible.\nThis is the greatest hoax. Now, it's gone on for a long time. We had the Mueller collusion delusion, okay? That went on for years. And that's finally done. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. It was a joke, and everyone knows it. And it was from the day one.Q.So——\nNow I get 3 days of peace, and I'm walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word \"impeachment.\" I said, \"What did I do now?\" And it was about a beautiful conversation that I had.\nAnd just remember this: The Ukrainian new President, a fine man, said: \"I don't know what you're talking about. There was no pressure.\" And he said it a number of times.\nOkay, what's your second question?\nWell, you shouldn't be asking two questions.\nJohn. John.\nJohn, ask one of the Finnish President.\nWe'll talk later. Sure.\nWell, it sounds like it might be a good question. Let me see if I like the question. Go ahead. [Laughter] Maybe for the first time in 3 years, I'll have a good question, and I'll love it.\nImpeachment Inquiry in the House of Representatives/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Relations\nOh, I love that question.\nIt shows that Schiff is a fraud.\nI love that question. Thank you, John.\nYes. There's nothing to finish.\nI hate to say it's the New York Times. I can't believe they wrote it.\nMaybe they're getting better.Q.Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the complaint being filed?\nWell, I think it's a scandal that he knew before. I'd go a step further: I think he's probably helped write it. Okay? That's what the word is. And I think it's—I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.\nIt just happened. As I'm walking up here, they handed it to me. And I said to Mike—I said: \"Whoa, that's something. That's big stuff.\" That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it too. It's a scam. It's a scam.\nJust to finish on this—I appreciate it. I love that second question, by the way. Should have asked it first. [Laughter] But let me just tell you: The whole thing is a scam. The Mueller deal was a scam. The Russian collusion was a scam. You can ask Putin. Nobody has been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay?\nNow, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia. And we will get along with Russia, because it's smart. But nobody has been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.\nYou please. Pick somebody who is really nice from Finland.\nPresident Niinistö.No more Finnish——\nDo you have a really nice person?\nPresident Niinistö.Finnish—–\nI think they're all nice in Finland.\nPresident Niinistö.Are there Finnish reporters? Just two. Okay.\nUh, oh.\nOr the other way around, you mean?\nPresident Niinistö.What favors I asked or was asked?\nI think you mean the other way around.\nPresident Niinistö.Both ways. Okay.\nSo the political storm, I've lived with it from the day I got elected. I've done more—and this administration has done—more than any administration in the history of this country in the first 2½ years. I'm used to it. For me, it's like putting on a suit in the morning.\nPeople have said to me, \"How does he handle it?\" Rush Limbaugh said, \"I don't know of any man in America that could handle it.\" Sean Hannity said the same thing. Others have said the same thing, \"I don't know any man in America . . .\" Because it's all a fraud.\nAnd because of that, and because I know that I'm right, and because I'm doing a great job for the American people, I'm very, very happy living the way I'm living. I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims, but this one turned out to be incredible, all because they didn't know that I had a transcript done by very, very talented people, word for word, comma for comma, done by people that do it for a living. I—we had an exact transcript.\nAnd when we produced that transcript, they died. Because you look at the whistleblower statement, and it's vicious. Vicious. And that whistleblower, there's no question in my mind that some bad things have gone on, and I think we'll get to the bottom of it. I think it's going to be a total reversal.\nBut I've lived with this. I've lived with this cloud now for almost 3 years, more than that, because it probably started even before. And I think nobody has done what I've done when you look at tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military and \"right to try.\" \"Right to try\"—that means people that are terminally ill and very sick have the right to use our medicines—our great medicines—because we're so far ahead of every other country.\nSo many things that we've done. Our vets are now taking care of. We've got choice. Nobody thought we could ever get choice. That's when you have to wait on line as a vet. You go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill. You don't have to wait for 3 weeks to see a doctor if you're a vet. We cherish our vets—at least this administration does. But for many years, they didn't. But I take care of the vets.\nNo administration has done—and I've lived with it from the day I got elected, so I'm just fine with it. Okay?\nPresident Niinistö.Yes. We had a conversation and discussion on a very equal basis, which is, I really appreciate that. Well, I had one request specifically. I wanted the President to take more notice on transatlantic relations, because I consider it's useful both for U.S.A. and Europe.\nWhile we were discussing also trading, I told the President that the big purchase we are doing on fighters will be finished in 2 years' time. We have five different candidates: three from Europe and two from United States. He answered that, \"Ours is best.\" [Laughter]\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.\nImpeachment Inquiry in the House of Representatives/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election/Congressional Subpoena Powers\nNo. No. I consider when they lie; when they stand before our great body in our great Chamber, and they make up a story that's fiction, like Schiff did. He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian President, and he made it into a total lie. It was a total fabrication. And you do admit that. It was a total fabrication.\nHe said, \"This is what . . .\"—and the only ones that don't like my conversation are the ones that never read it. But they heard Shifty Schiff. That's what I call a lie. And because of the fact that he's—he's lying about the President of the United States and as to what the President says—you know, I—believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully. There are those that think I'm a very stable genius. Okay? I watch my words very, very closely. And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad—it was so evil. And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there's corruption involved.\nAnd just so you know, we've been investigating, on a personal basis—through Rudy and others, lawyers—corruption in the 2016 election. We've been investigating corruption, because I probably will—I was going to definitely—but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.\nAnd I have every right to do that. Because the way they've treated me and other people, they've destroyed people. They've destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never existed. And that was collusion. Never existed. And you had 18 people that hated Donald Trump. And you had Bob Mueller that hated Donald Trump. And in the end, they couldn't find one damn thing. I could find it on you. They couldn't find one thing about Donald Trump having to do with collusion. This is after 2 years and spending $42 million.\nAnd I've been looking at that long and hard for a long period of time: how it started, why it started. It should never happen to another President ever. But I've been talking about it from the standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit, and I've been talking about it for a long time.\nWe've been investigating the corruption, having to do with what they did to my people. They destroyed many of—many people. They came down to Washington to do a great job, and they left home. They left Washington dark. They were dark. They came down here, I say, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. They wanted to do a great job for the people. They wanted to do a great job. We won the election. And then, they get served with subpoenas. All these subpoenas. Now, look at Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like—you know, she has to approve it. She hands out subpoenas like they're cookies. \"You want a subpoena? Here you go. Take them.\" Like they're cookies. Paul Ryan would never give anybody a subpoena. He wouldn't give them when Mark Meadows went in to talk. He wouldn't give them when Jim Jordan went in. When Devin Nunes—he would go in, and they'd see Paul. I'm not saying wrong or right, but Paul Ryan: \"No, let's talk about it. That's a big thing, to give a subpoena. Let's talk about it.\" Two weeks later, they're still talking. They wanted subpoenas to investigate the corrupt Democrats and the corrupt people on the other side. Paul Ryan would not give subpoenas.\nNancy Pelosi? \"Here you go. Take it. Who wants a subpoena?\" Every day, you get subpoenas. And Paul Ryan was actually right, probably, because they should never, ever allow a thing like this to happen to our country again.\nThank you very much. Please.\nIf you look at what he said—okay? And he brought it up. I think he brought up the name, \"Rudy Giuliani.\" What I want is the following: And I've said this loud and clear. We have our Ambassadors here. We have Mike Pence here. Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine?\nWe give money to Ukraine, and it's bothered me from day one. And you have plenty of people—just here. I say, \"How come it's always the United States that gets ripped?\" Frankly, Ukraine, we want to help them. And I do like the new President. You know why I like him? Because he was honest, because he said, \"There was no pressure at all exerted on me\"—meaning him—\"by the President of the United States.\" He said it. By the way, that one sentence should stop this. But he said there was no pressure exerted.\nBut you don't have to ask him; all you have to do is read the transcript. Read the telephone call.\nBut what I was having a problem with are two things. Number one, Ukraine is known—before him—for tremendous corruption—tremendous—more than just about any country in the world. In fact, they're rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world. And I don't like giving money to a country that's that corrupt.\nExcuse me. Number two, I said the following—and I said this loud and clear to everybody. And, in fact, Rob Portman backed me up, and there's nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio. Because he called up: \"Please, let the money go.\" I said: \"Rob, I hate being the country that's always giving money when Ukraine helps Europe and the European countries far more than they help us.\" They're like a wall between Russia and Europe. They're like a wall. They're a big, wide, beautiful wall.\nAnd he said: \"You know what? But it's important.\" And he—in fact, he came out, and he said that. That was my only reason. Because I don't like being the sucker country. We were the sucker country for years and years. We're not the sucker country anymore. But I gave the money, because Rob Portman and others called me and asked. But I don't like to be the sucker. And European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine.\nGo ahead. Ask a question, please.\nLook, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked. And you know it. His son walks out with millions of dollars. The kid knows nothing. You know it, and so do we.\nGo ahead. Ask a question now.\nAre you talking to me?\nYou haven't finished with me? Listen. Listen. Are you ready? We have the President of Finland. Ask him a question.\nDid you hear me?\nDid you hear me?\nAsk him a question.\nI've given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. [Laughter] Don't be rude.\nI've answered everything. It's a whole hoax. And you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say, in many cases, the \"corrupt media\"—because you're corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it's corrupt.\nAnd you have some very fine people too—great journalists, great reporters—but, to a large extent, it's corrupt, and it's fake.\nAsk the President of Finland a question, please.\nWorld Trade Organization/Finland-U.S. Relations/News Media\nThat was a big win for the United States, right?\nPresident Niinistö.Yes.\nYou never had wins with other Presidents, did you? But we're having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became President.\nYes. Okay.\nExcuse me. Your wins are now, because they think I don't like the WTO, and they want to make sure I'm happy. Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years. They know that I'm wise to it. We've had a lot of wins.\nThis was a $7 billion win. Not bad. Go ahead.\nPresident Niinistö.But I think the question is for me.\nAnd I just want to finish by saying it's an honor to be with the President of Finland. He's done a fantastic job. Very popular, beloved over in Finland.\nThe WTO has been much better to us since I've been President because they understand they can't get away with what they've been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.\nAnd please remember the President's last remarks: that we are a great democracy. We are a great—the United States is a great democracy. And I'm airing what I'm airing, because we are, in fact, a democracy. And if the press were straight and honest and forthright and tough, we would be a far greater nation.\nOh. We would be a far greater when we don't have the CNNs of the world, who are corrupt people. Thank you very much, everybody.President Niinistö.Yes.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-sauli-niinisto-finland-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Sergio Mattarella of Italy", "Date": "2019-10-16", "Text": "Thank you very much. Today it is my honor to welcome President Sergio Mattarella of Italy to the White House. We've known each other for a while. We've dealt with each other for a while. And we've had some really great conversations. We've had a very productive discussion throughout the day with our staffs and representatives. And I look forward to hosting the President and his daughter Laura at a reception for Italian Americans this evening. I look forward to that very much.\nThe United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome. Over the centuries, the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent works of art, science, philosophy, architecture, and music. On Monday, we paid tribute to the Italian explorer who led a voyage of discovery to the New World, a gentleman known as Christopher Columbus. And to me, it will always be called Columbus Day. Some people don't like that; I do.\nToday, the United States and Italy draw strength from our cherished heritage, as we work together to safeguard our people and promote prosperity. As NATO allies, our countries cooperate closely on a wide range of critical defense issues, including the protection of our nations against radical Islamic terrorism. The problem is that Italy is only paying 1.1 percent, instead of the mandated 2 percent, which, by and of itself, is a low number. It should be probably 4 percent, anywhere from 4 to 5 percent. Only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are paying the 2 percent, meaning 20 of the countries are delinquent in the payment to NATO. And they have been for many years.\nGermany is at 1.3 percent, at most, depending on calculations. Spain is at less than 1 percent. Turkey, believe it or not, is almost current, almost paid up. And I want to just thank Secretary General Stoltenberg, because he is going around saying that President Trump was able to raise over $100 billion last year, which is true. But it's still only a large fraction. It's a still a large fraction of the amount of money that's owed by many of the countries that aren't paying their dues.\nWe hope that Italy will boost its defense spending in order to meet NATO's minimum 2 percent of GDP. And I will say that they have just purchased—and we learned about it today—90 brandnew, beautiful F-35s. The Strike Fighter program is doing phenomenally well.\nOne of our major challenges and the challenge facing NATO today is instability in the Mediterranean, North Africa areas. And much of the volatility in that region stems from the violence in Libya, which is very close to Italy's borders. The President and I were talking about that at great length. Big problem. The ongoing Libyan conflict has led to a migration crisis, placing significant and unfair burdens on Italy, in particular.\nI've asked that the European Union get much more involved, because they're not involved enough. That's a problem for the European Union. They do very well with us on trade. They had a trade surplus with the United States, over the last 5 or 6 years, of about $150 billion a year. They have to get more involved and help Italy.\nThe Italian Government has stepped up as a leader to fight this illegal immigration. We urge also our NATO and European partners to take firm action to halt illegal immigration and uphold sovereign borders. Immigration control is critical to national security and essential to the well-being of our citizens. Nations must be able to vet, screen, and properly manage entry and admission into society.\nYou know the legislation that we had passed. We have absolutely no help with—from the Democrats on our borders. Absolutely nothing. The closure of loopholes, which would be very easy to do, they refuse to do. They want open borders, and Italy doesn't want open borders. And we're not going to have open borders. And our numbers are very good.\nI want to thank also Mexico and the President of Mexico for the great help they've given us. They've helped us much more than the Democrats. Here in the United States, we're taking dramatic action to secure our borders, shut down smuggling networks, and speed the removal of illegal immigrants. We're moving the MS-13 gang members out literally by the thousands. They're getting out. We're dropping them out of our country, and they can't come back.\nAnd what we've done with Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador is, they tell me, close to a miracle, the agreements that we've signed. They accept them back, and they keep them back. It's a much different relationship than we've ever had with those three countries, and I want to thank the leadership of those three countries. We've been working well—very well together.\nOur message is clear: If you enter illegally the United States, you will be promptly returned home. They're all returning home. It takes a long time, because we've had years of people coming in, staying, and that's the end of that.\nPresident Mattarella also discussed the steps we must take to enhance commerce and economic growth between our two countries. Our nations are already investing nearly $70 billion in each other's economies. Without the burdens, as unfair as they are—imposed by the European Union—we would actually have a much higher number than $70 billion, between Italy and the United States. However, we can do more, and we can achieve fairness and reciprocity, which we don't have right now.\nAmerica's trade deficit with Italy accounts for about 20 percent of our nearly $150 to $170 billion—probably, according to some estimates, could even be $178 billion—annual trade deficit with the European Union. We welcome Italy's support for a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the EU that ensures a level playing field for American workers. And it hasn't been that for many, many years.\nI could solve the problem instantly, but it would be too harsh. It'd be too harsh. It would involve tariffs on European products coming into this country. And for right now, we're going to try and do it without that. But that would solve the problem instantly because the United States is not being treated fairly.\nWe also welcome Italy's participation in combating predatory trade and investment practices worldwide, especially in technology. We must work together to shield our intellectual property, critical infrastructure, ports, and data security. I applaud Italy's recent commitment to use only safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains, especially relating to the 5G networks. We will work together to take further steps to secure the technology of the future.\nAnd speaking of 5G and how it relates to China, we've done a rather incredible trade deal—especially right now, phase one—for our farmers and for the finance industry, financial services. And it's been really quite amazing.\nExcuse me? Is there a problem back there?\nIt's been quite amazing. The level of receptivity has been much different than in the past. China and myself—our representatives, their representatives—have made a deal from $40 [billion; White House correction.] to $50 billion in farm products, agricultural products. People said we were hoping for $20 [billion; White House correction.].*\nSo China has been good. And they've already started purchasing, by the way. That's already started. The agreement—we hope to have it signed sometime prior to Chile. We're going to Chile—President Xi and myself. We'll probably do a signing over there, of phase one, assuming it all gets finished up, which we think it will.\nThere's been a lot of good will between the United States and China over the last period of time. So we're signing from $40 [billion; White House correction.] to $50 billion. And that will—because it was incorrectly reported in the press, shockingly—that will take place—it's already started taking place. They're already purchasing a lot of farm product.\nAll of the banking regulations and all of the financial services, all of the other things that are included—and there are many other things in phase one that I won't talk about now—but all of that is moving along rapidly. Bob Lighthizer is with us someplace here, and he is in the process of getting it completed. Have a great staff of people working on both sides.\nThank you. Thank you. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And the WTO, the World Trade Organization—as everyone knows, we just won $7½ billion because of unfair trade practices. And that will be distributed in a fair way throughout various countries in Europe.\nAnd we're talking to the President about that as it pertains to Italy. He thought we were a little bit harsh on Italy, and we don't want to be harsh on Italy. We'll never do that. So we'll look at that very strongly. We will look at that for you. That was one of the requests made. And we will be taking a look at that.\nNo, President Erdogan's decision didn't surprise me, because he's wanted to do that for a long time. He's been building up troops on the border with Syria for a long time, as you know.\nOur soldiers are mostly gone from the area. We only had 26, 28—but under 50. We think it's probably 28, but under 50 soldiers, and—which is a very tiny force. And it didn't surprise me at all. This is—they've been warring for many years. It's unnatural for us, but it's sort of natural for them. They fight, and they fight long, and they fight hard. And they've been fighting Syria for a long time and on the border; that's the border with Syria. And I say: \"Why are we protecting Syria's land? Asad is not a friend of ours. Why are we protecting their land?\"\nAnd Syria also has a relationship with the Kurds—who, by the way, are no angels. Okay? Who is an angel? There aren't too many around. But Syria has a relationship with the Kurds. So they'll come in for their border, and they'll fight. They may bring partners in. They could bring Russia in. And I say, \"Welcome to it.\" Russia went into Afghanistan when it was the Soviet Union, and it became Russia. It became a much smaller country because of Afghanistan. You can overextend, you can do a lot of things, but frankly, if Russia is going to help in protecting the Kurds, that's a good thing, not a bad thing. But it would be led by Syria.\nAnd Syria doesn't want Turkey to take its land. I can understand that. But what does that have to do with the United States of America if they're fighting over Syria's land? Are we supposed to fight a NATO member in order that Syria, who is not our friend, keeps their land? I don't think so. But Syria does have a relationship with the Kurds.\nThe thing that's common is that everybody hates ISIS. Now, the PKK, which is a part of the Kurds, as you know, is probably worse at terror and more of a terrorist threat, in many ways, than ISIS. So it's a very semicomplicated—not too complicated, if you're smart—but it's a semicomplicated problem. And I think it's a problem that we have very nicely under control.\nWe have two countries wanting their land. We have one country that wants land perhaps that doesn't belong to them, because they want to have a 22-mile strip of, they call it, \"freedom.\" They call it a lot of things. They want to get terrorists out. You have another country that says, \"You can't have our land.\" And they're going to have to work that out.\nNow, with that being said, Vice President Mike Pence is going there. He'll be leaving either late tonight or tomorrow. And he was going to leave yesterday, but they have to have certain security done. He's a very important man in our country. And he'll be leaving with Secretary of State Pompeo. We already have representatives there negotiating with Turkey. We've put massive sanctions on Turkey, and we have additional sanctions on Turkey.\nAnd when I ran, I ran on the basis, we're going to bring our great soldiers back home where they belong. We don't have to fight these endless wars. We're bringing them back home. That's what I won on. And some people, whether it's—you call it the \"military-industrial complex\" or beyond that—they'd like me to stay.\nOne of the problems I have, and one of—for instance, with the witch hunt, you have people that want me to stay; they want me to fight forever. They do very well fighting. That's what they want to do: fight. A lot of companies want to fight because they make their weapons based on fighting, not based on peace. And they take care of a lot of people. I want to bring our soldiers back home. We're not a police force; we're a fighting force. We're the greatest fighting force ever.\nI spent $2½ trillion over the last almost 3 years, rebuilding our military. When I took it over, it was a mess. It was an absolute mess. It was totally depleted. You know that, and a lot of people know that. Honest people all know that. When I was thinking about having to do something, one of our generals came in to see me, and he said, \"Sir, we don't have ammunition.\" I said, \"That's a terrible thing you just said.\" He said, \"We don't have ammunition.\"\nNow we have more ammunition than we've ever had. We have more missiles. We have more rockets. Our nuclear has been totally updated and, in some cases, new. Hopefully, to God, we never have to use it, but we have the most powerful nuclear base, by far, in the world. And we have things that we never had before. We have a great modern military, but that doesn't mean we're going to waste it. It doesn't mean we're going to deplete it, like we did before with these crazy, endless wars.\nSo Turkey and Syria will, hopefully, work it out between themselves. Hopefully, ISIS will be guarded. I told—I spoke with, as you know, a wonderful man yesterday—a general—from the Kurds. You all know who I'm talking about. Some of you have seen the letter that I put out to Erdogan. I gave it to him—President Erdogan. And some of you have seen it. With the general, I said, \"Listen, don't open those doors and let them out just to create more havoc so that we come in.\" Because some of those doors were just opened. \"Let's create some havoc and some political exposure for the President of the United States.\"\nWe were the ones that—we were the ones that got ISIS. We're the ones that took care of it—specifically me, because I'm the one that gave the order. Because when I came in, under President Obama, ISIS was a disaster all over that area. I was the one that got them. We were the ones that captured them. And I will say this: that Russia, Iran, Syria, and to maybe a slightly lesser extent, Turkey, they all hate ISIS as much as we do. And it's their part of the world. We're 7,000 miles away.\nI campaigned on bringing our soldiers back home, and that's what I'm doing. That includes other places too, many other places. Statutorily, it takes a period of time. Diplomatically, it takes a period of time. But you know, we're in many countries. Many, many countries. I'm embarrassed to tell you how many. I know the exact number, but I'm embarrassed to say it because it's so foolish.\nWe're in countries—we're protecting countries that don't even like us. They take advantage of us. They don't pay. Nothing. You probably saw—some of you wrote and covered the fact that we're sending some additional troops to Saudi Arabia. That's true. And I appreciate the fact that I negotiated, for a short period of time—a matter of minutes—with Saudi Arabia, and they've agreed to pay for the full cost of all of that deployment, and more. Much more. A very rich country; they should be paying. And so should many other countries be paying if they want this kind of protection.\nSame with NATO. We're at 4 percent, and other countries are at 1 percent. And certainly, a European country benefits much more than we do with NATO. I mean, it's there for a reason. And perhaps we benefit, but not nearly as much as the European countries. Some people say we don't benefit at all. We put ourselves at harm's way. But we do that for Europe, but then they treat us badly on trade. Not fair.\nSo I would say that we're in a great position. We're doing what I said. We have two countries that are going to argue over their border. Hopefully, they'll work it out. We're going to try and work it out. I think our Vice President, who's a very capable man, will do well tomorrow. He's going to meet with President Erdogan. Or, President Erdogan said he wouldn't meet with anybody, and he took that back just a little while ago. And he said, \"No, I will.\" And I think they'll have a successful meeting.\nIf they don't, the sanctions and tariffs and other things that we're doing—we will do and are doing to Turkey—will be devastating to Turkey's economy. I got Pastor Brunson home. Nobody else could do it. The previous administration tried very hard. They were unable to do it. I did it very quickly. And let's see what happens, but I think we'll be successful.\nBut we've got to get out of the endless wars. We have to bring our troops back home. I go to Walter Reed, and I give out Purple Hearts; just did it on Friday. I see the incredible soldiers coming home to Dover, coming home in a coffin, on areas that we have nothing to do with—we have nothing to do with. And it's heartbreaking. I sign letters all the time to parents whose son was shot in different places, in the Middle East mostly. It's very heartbreaking to see. Very heartbreaking. So I've said it. And it's through strength, not through weakness. Much harder to do what I'm doing. I could be like all of these others: \"Oh, just leave them there. Leave them there.\" No, I can't do it. Much easier for me—much—probably politically better for me just to say, \"We'll leave a lot of people there, and we'll fight.\" They don't even know what they're fighting for. It's much more difficult, politically. It's not politically expedient; it's just the opposite.\nAnd I have people, even on my side, they want to fight. I say, \"Why are we fighting?\" \"I don't know.\" They don't even know.\nSo you have Syria, and you have Turkey, and they're going to argue it out. Maybe they're going to fight it out. But our men aren't going to get killed over it. And just one other thing, they've been fighting for hundreds of years. This has been going on for hundreds of years.\nSo it's a long answer, but I think I've got much of it out. Thank you very much.\nBy the way, the digital tax, I have to say, is interesting, because I did discuss it with another European Union member, namely France. And France is basically doing the digital tax. And I'm no fan of those companies. They were against me. Somebody said I lost maybe 2 million votes, maybe more, because of Facebook. But these are American companies. And whether you like it or not, they're great, big, American companies. And I'm not happy with the digital tax, where France, and European Union is taxing our companies. And, as you know, we imposed a big tax on French wine because of it.\nSo, just to answer your question, Kevin [Kevin Corke, Fox News], I'm not happy about the fact that they are taxing our companies. I'm not a fan of those companies, but if anybody is going to tax those companies, it should be the U.S.A. It shouldn't be France and the European Union, who have really taken advantage of the United States. Okay? Thank you very much. Good question.\nOkay, you can pick somebody, Mr. President.\nYes.\nWell, I don't know the details; I just know that our country is looking into the corruption of the 2016 election. It was a corrupt election, whether it's Comey or McCabe or Strzok or his lover, Lisa Page—the two great lovers. There was a lot of corruption. Maybe it goes right up to President Obama. I happen to think it does.\nBut you look at Brennan, and you look at Clapper, and you get some real beauties. I know that they're looking into the corruption. Obviously, the IG report is coming out soon, so we'll find out.\nI don't know anything about the meeting, but certainly, it would be appropriate. Because the word is—and you read it in the same papers that I do—that they did go to other countries to try and hide what they are doing. Italy may have been one of them. So you'll really ask to—have to ask Attorney General Barr. Okay? Thank you.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], go ahead.\nSure.\nI didn't give him a green light.\nNo, Lindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers and fighting other people's wars. I want to get out of the Middle East.\nI think Lindsey should focus right now on judiciary, like the Democrats—the \"do-nothing Democrats,\" as I call them, because they're doing nothing. They're getting nothing done. They're not getting USMCA done, between Canada, the United States, and Mexico. They're getting nothing done.\nAnd I think Lindsey should focus on judiciary. He ought to find out about what happened with Comey, what happened with McCabe, Lisa, what happened with Peter Strzok, what happened with President Obama, what happened with Brennan. That's what Lindsey ought to focus on. That's what the people of South Carolina want him to focus on. The people of South Carolina don't want us to get into a war with Turkey—a NATO member—or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars. They've been fighting for 1,000 years. Let them fight their own wars. The people of South Carolina want to see those troops come home. And I won an election based on that. And that's the way it is, whether it's good or bad. That's the way it is.\nAnd if you look at this country, I'd be willing to bet anything—political instinct—that that's what the country wants. I'm going to get involved in a war between Turkey and Syria, especially when, if you look at the Kurds—and again, I say this with great respect: They're no angels. [Laughter] If you look at PKK——\nTake a look at PKK. ISIS respects PKK. You know, why? Because they're as tough or tougher than ISIS. You take a look at a lot of the things having to do—you have to say it—nobody wants to say it. We're making the Kurds look like they're angels. We paid a lot of money to the Kurds. Tremendous amounts of money. We've given them massive fortunes. And you know what? It's wonderful. They fought with us. But we paid a lot for them to fight with us. But, just so you understand, we were the ones that captured ISIS. People let some go; they opened a couple of doors to make us look as bad as possible. We have a situation where Turkey is taking land from Syria. Syria is not happy about it. Let them work it out. We shouldn't be over there.\nAnd you should get your accounts correct. And you shouldn't be showing up buildings blowing up in Kentucky and say it's Syria, because that really is fake news.\nYes, please. Ask a question.\nOh, absolutely. Russia. Russia hates ISIS. Russia hates ISIS as much as the United States does. Iran hates ISIS. I mean, we're fighting a war for Russia.\nWe're fighting a war for Iran. If you look at Syria, Syria hates ISIS. We're over there killing ISIS and we're killing—don't forget, we're 7,000 miles away. So we're killing ISIS. We're 7,000 miles away. Russia is much closer. Iran is right there. Turkey is right there. They all—they all hate ISIS. Turkey a little bit less so, but the others, very much.\nRussia had a plane blown up by ISIS. Russia wants nothing to do with ISIS. Russia is tough. They can kill ISIS just as well, and they happen to be in their neighborhood. And all I'm saying is this: I'm not going to lose potentially thousands and tens of thousands of American soldiers fighting a war between Turkey and Syria. Syria is not our friend. Asad is not our friend. That's the way it goes.\nPlease, ask a question to the President.\nWithdrawal of U.S. Forces From Syria/U.S. Military Involvement in the Middle East\nTwenty-eight. They say it was 28. We thought it was 50, but it was about 28—26 to 28 troops. All accounted for, nobody injured——\nListen: All accounted for. Nobody injured. Nobody missing. It's really nice.\nYou know, what's happened? No American soldiers have been killed. That's what's happened. And other people will go in—and very easy to recapture those people that, probably, the Kurds let go to make a little bit stronger political impact. And that's okay. I fully understand it, but that's the way it goes.\nWe're bringing our soldiers back home. And we've done a great job. We were supposed to be in Syria for one month. That was 10 years ago. And we've been a police force. It's time to bring our soldiers back home. That's the way it is. We've had no soldiers injured or hurt. That's because I'm President. And we're the boss. Just remember that. We have the most powerful military in the world, by far.\nOkay?\nItaly-U.S. Relations/President Trump's Use of Tariffs/European Union-U.S. Trade\n[A reporter spoke in Italian, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nWell, I'll answer first. Yes, I am satisfied. They have been very accommodating. They weren't at the beginning, and they have been since then.\nAnd I want to just thank the Italian Government and your Prime Minister, actually, in addition to the President. But as you know, I had long conversations with my friend, and they were very nice. So I am very satisfied. And we just discussed the same conversation with the President. We're very satisfied. Thank you.\nWell, actually, the tariff situation is interesting because we just—it's like I said with China, and it turned out to be true—we cannot lose a war of tariffs because the imbalance is so great between the United States and, in this case, the European Union. Also true with China. That turned out to be right. We've collected tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. We've given some to the farmers, to make them even. And now the farmers are going to have a bigger contract than they ever thought possible. They won't be able to produce even that much, but I think they will, because they're incredible, ingenious. As I say, jokingly, but probably not jokingly: They'll just have to buy larger tractors, which is probably what they're doing right now. But the farmers come out so well.\nBut in a war of tariffs with the European Union, the trade imbalance is so great that we can't lose that, because they do much more business than we do, and that's unfortunate. But the word \"reciprocity\" is probably my favorite word. Of all of these words, all of the semicomplicated, complicated—to me, not complicated at all—things that we're doing, it's got to be reciprocal, and it's not.\nThe European Union has taken tremendous advantage of the United States. Many of us come through—one way or the other—through the European Union. That's the good news. The bad news is they've been very smart. They've been very smart. Jean-Claude has been brilliant. Now he's leaving, but he's been—he's been brilliant at really helping them and not helping us.\nAnd so that's changing now. But we can't lose that particular war of tariffs, because the trade imbalance is tremendous. It's tremendous. And if you look at what they don't have—the barriers that they put up; they put up tremendous barriers to our doing business in Europe—tremendous barriers—both from a monetary standpoint and what they call \"nonmonetary barriers.\"\nIt's a very tough thing. Our farm products, very hard to get them in. Our cars, very hard to get them in. And yet they send Mercedes. They send BMW. Then they send Volkswagen; Renault, in the case of France. So it's a very tough situation for us for many years, but now it's a very tough situation for them. Because I can remedy the situation very easily, and there really is not any financial counterattack. Hopefully, I don't have to do that.\nWe are—with all of the being said, we are talking. We're talking with some new people in Europe, and I hope it's going to be successful; that way, we don't have to talk about it or worry about it, because our relationship should be a great one. But we have to be treated fairly on NATO, and we have to be treated fairly on trade with the European Union.\nThank you all very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-sergio-mattarella-italy"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey", "Date": "2019-11-13", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. Please. I want to begin by welcoming the First Lady with us today, and the First Lady of Turkey. Thank you very much for being here. This is a great honor to have you.\nAnd we had a wonderful and a very productive meeting. And before we start, I would like to thank President Erdogan for releasing detainee Serkan Golge, who was in detention—in different forms of detention. And I appreciate that very much. That was a very nice tribute. And he'll be coming back at some point in the not-too-distant future. So that's very good news for the United States and also very good news for Turkey.\nTurkey, as everyone knows, is a great NATO ally and a strategic partner of the United States around the world. Our economic relationship has tremendous potential and continues to expand and to grow. Direct engagement and diplomacy between our nations are essential to ensuring a future of peace and prosperity and promise for our citizens.\nOver the course of the day, President Erdogan and I had a frank and productive conversation on a range of very important topics. Among those topics we discussed was the situation in Syria.\nLast month, I sent Vice President Pence; Secretary of State Pompeo is with us; National Security Adviser O'Brien—thank you—to meet with President Erdogan in the hopes of ending all of the hostilities. The negotiations were very successful, and the United States and Turkey achieved a tremendous amount on that day. And I think we're working toward getting it better and better. It's a complicated situation. It's been going on for hundreds of years.\nToday, the cease-fire continues to hold. And I want to thank the President for his partnership and cooperation as we work to build a more stable and peaceful and prosperous Middle East. We've assured each other that Turkey will continue to uphold what it's supposed to uphold. I'm a big fan of the President, I have to tell you that. And I know that the cease-fire, while complicated, is moving forward and moving forward at a very rapid clip. There's a lot of people that want to see that work after so many decades and so many centuries, you might say.\nThe United States and Turkey are working extensively on many other security issues. Turkey has the second largest armed forces in NATO after the United States. And they're a very strong second, I might add. And I'm pleased that Turkey has been steadily increasing its defense spending and is very close to the 2-percent-of-GDP range, unlike many of the other countries. At this moment, they're 8 out of the 28 countries that are current, in terms of their obligation, financially.\nTurkey has made a vital contribution to NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan, and its partnership was important to our destruction of the ISIS caliphate. In fact, just recently, when we took out al-Baghdadi—and take him out, we did—Turkey knew that we were going over certain areas. They were very, very helpful, and we appreciate that very much. Good for both countries. We really appreciate it. We're grateful to President Erdogan and to the citizens of Turkey for their cooperation in the constant struggle against terrorism. He fights it like we do.\nKey to our security collaboration is our trade—defense and military equipment program. American foreign military sales to Turkey total many billions of dollars, and Turkey supplies component parts to many American defense programs. They make parts of the frame, as an example, for the F-35. Turkey's acquisition of sophisticated Russian military equipment, such as the S-400, creates some very serious challenges for us, and we are talking about it constantly. We talked about it today. We're talking about it in the future. Hopefully, we'll be able to resolve that situation. We've asked our Secretary of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs and our respective National Security Advisers to immediately work on resolving the S-400 issue.\nWe've also recently agreed to work toward a $100 billion two-way trade agreement—Secretary Ross is here—and I think we've made tremendous progress on that. We have a lot of trade with Turkey, but it could be many times larger. And Turkey would like to see that, and it would also be good for the United States. So we intend to bring it up to about $100 billion. That would be four times what it is right now. Our goal is to expand commerce between the United States and Turkey, reduce our trade deficit, and ensure a truly fair and reciprocal relationship.\nWe are, just for those of you that have any interest—we discussed it today also—our trade agreement with China is moving along very rapidly. We'll see what happens, but it's moving along rapidly. China wants to make a deal, that I can tell you.\nOne of my chief priorities as President has been removing the barriers to American trade and investment and ending the illicit practices that harm our workers. We encourage Turkey to further open its markets—and they are doing that; they're doing that very much—toward American goods and American services. Our markets are open. Turkey is opening up their markets, and they're opening up rapidly.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\n[President Erdogan spoke in Turkish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nWell, thank you very much, Mr. President. And I called up the Senate; I asked a couple of our Senators. And we really ended up with five, and others wanting to come, and we'll keep them apprised. But some of them joined us. They happen to be here. Senator Jim Risch. Thank you, Jim, very much. Ted Cruz, thank you very much. Lindsey Graham. Lindsey, thank you. And Rick Scott. Thank you, Rick, very much. Joni is here—Joni Ernst—someplace.\nThese are people that want to see peace in the Middle East, and I thought it would be appropriate to have them come over. And they met with the President, and we had a lot of very frank discussion. And we're dealing with a very big subject, a complex subject. It's been going on for centuries, in many cases. But we're making a lot of progress—tremendous progress—in the Middle East.\nOkay, a couple of questions. Go ahead, OAN. Go ahead.\nThank you.\nAre you talking about the witch hunt? Is that what you mean? [Laughter] Is that what you're talking about? I hear it's a joke. I haven't watched. I haven't watched for 1 minute because I've been with the President, which is much more important, as far as I'm concerned. This is a sham and shouldn't be allowed. It was a situation that was caused by people that shouldn't have allowed it to happen.\nI want to find out who is the whistleblower, because the whistleblower gave a lot of very incorrect information, including my call with the President of Ukraine, which was a perfect call and highly appropriate. And he wrote something that was much different than the fact. I want to find out why the IG—why would he have presented that, when, in fact, all he had to do was check the call itself and he would have seen it.\nI'm going to be releasing—I think, on Thursday—a second call, which actually was the first of the two. And you'll make a determination as to what you think there. But I've heard—just a report—they said it's all thirdhand information. Nothing direct at all. It can't be direct because I never said it.\nAnd all they have to do is look very, very simply at the transcript. If you read the transcript—this was analyzed by great lawyers. This was analyzed by Gregg Jarrett. It was analyzed by Mark Levin. It was analyzed by everybody. They said this statement that I made—the whole call that I made with the President of Ukraine was a perfect one.\nSo that this country gets put through that, that we have to waste this gentleman's time by even thinking about it, talking about it—I'd much rather focus on peace in the Middle East. And I hear that it's a hoax, and it's being played as a hoax. That's what I hear, but you'll have to tell me.\nGo ahead.Syrian Refugees in Turkey/Repatriation of Captured Terrorist Suspects/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/Turkey's Incursion Into Northern Syria\nYes.\nWell, no. I think that, frankly, Europe should be paying for this, to a large extent. As of this moment, Turkey has been paying for most of it. I think the President was saying today, they've spent over $40 billion on the cost of that—40 billion.\n[President Erdogan spoke in English as follows.]\nHow much?\nForty. That's what I said. [Laughter] Whatever. He spent a lot, okay? [Laughter] They're giving—they're throwing out all these different numbers. I heard it was $40 billion. How was that—40 billion? Correct? So $40 billion. And I've heard that number from others. And that's a lot. Europe has contributed about 3 [billion; White House correction.]. And a lot of these people would go all throughout Europe. I mean, it would be a devastating situation for Europe, because he's got 4 million people. He has a lot of Kurds, too, that they're helping and taking care of.\nSo I have spoken to Europe about it. I think they should help us with ISIS, because many of them left France, and they left Germany, and they left U.K., they left different countries. And these countries should help us, because if they ever did get released, which we won't be doing—but if they ever did get released, that's where they want to go. They want to go back to France and Germany and U.K. and all of those other countries that are not helping us. I gave them the option, \"Would you like to have them back?\" And intelligently, they said, \"No, thank you.\" But that's not right, and it's not fair.\nI can tell you also that Turkey captured—when they—some escaped during the conflict, when they had the heavy shooting. And I mean, I think I know how they happened to escape, but it's one of those things. Doesn't matter, because Turkey captured everybody that escaped, plus an additional group.\nWhen we took over, when I became President, ISIS was rampant all over the Middle East. And, as of about a month ago, I think, Lindsey, we can say that we have now 100 percent of the caliphate. And they'll always try and grow, but they haven't been able to do that. And what we did last week with al-Baghdadi—who is the absolute founder, leader—set them back. We also got his number two, and we have our sights on his number three.\nSo they're not going to be growing too fast. But I will say, Turkey has been helping us a lot.\nThank you very much. Would you like to pick somebody?\nA friendly person from Turkey, please. Friendly. Only friendly reporters we like to see. There aren't——\n——too many of them around.\nThank you.\nKurds/Turkey-U.S. Relations/Turkey-U.S. Trade\nWell, I had a very good talk with him. We had a very good—recently. And we're working very closely together, and we're also working very closely together with your great President. And a lot of things are happening. A lot of very positive developments are happening.\nA lot of that is definition: what's your definition of the various groups within the Kurds—you call the \"Kurds\"—and then you have various groups. And some like them, and some don't. But I think we've made a tremendous amount of—we've gained a tremendous amount of momentum and strength and knowledge over the last short period of time. So we'll see what happens. But I will say that the relationship with President Erdogan and Turkey has been outstanding. And you know, it's a major country with a tremendous military. They're one of our very big purchasers of military equipment. They have the finest equipment in the world, which the United States makes. We make, by far, the best equipment in the world. Turkey understood that a long time ago.\nSo I think a tremendous amount of progress is being made. Okay? Thank you very much.\nYou could ask the President a question, now. Same reporter. You're sure you're a reporter? You don't work for Turkey with that question? [Laughter]\nJohn of Fox [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nThank you.\nImpeachment Testimony/U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon D. Sondland\nI know nothing about that. First time I've heard it. The one thing I've seen that Sondland said was that he did speak to me for a brief moment, and I said, \"No quid pro quo under any circumstances.\" And that's true. The other, I'd never heard this.\nIn any event, it's more secondhand information, but I've never heard it.Q.Do you recall having a conversation with Sondland on July 26?\nI don't recall. No, not at all. Not even a little bit. The only thing—and I guess Sondland has stayed with testimony that there was no quid pro quo. Pure and simple.\nYes, please.\nPresident, please.\n[President Erdogan spoke in English as follows.]\nYes. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.\nRight.\nWell, thank you very much. And I will say that we've had a great relationship with the Kurds. And we fought with them very successfully against ISIS. We fought together. We had—we have great generals, and we have great equipment, and it's certainly helped a lot. But we were very, very successful.\nAnd we captured, as I said before, 100 percent. I was going to—when we were at 97 percent, I was going to say, \"Well, that sounds pretty high to me.\" And I was thinking about stopping it then. And a lot of people said, \"Please, go to a hundred.\" And very quickly, very rapidly, the military got the hundred. I wanted to have that. But we have a great relationship with the Kurds—we have had. We're with them now; we get along with them.\nAnd by the way, I think the President, he may have some factions within the Kurds, but I think the President has a great relationship with the Kurds. Many Kurds live currently in Turkey. And they're happy, and they're taken care of, including health care—we were talking about it before—including health care and education and other things. So that's really a misnomer. But our relationship with the Kurds has been a very good one. Okay? Thank you.\n[President Erdogan spoke in Turkish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-turkey"}
{"Title": "Interview with Joe Kernen of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in Davos, Switzerland", "Date": "2020-01-22", "Text": "Morning.\nThat's right.\nNo. Not at all. And-- we're-- we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's—going to be just fine.\nI do. I do. I have a great relationship with President Xi. We just signed probably the biggest deal ever made. It certainly has the potential to be the biggest deal ever made. And-- it was a very interesting period of time time.\nBut we got it done, and-- no, I do. I think-- the relationship is very, very good.\nI did. I did. I watched some of it last night\nI got-- I had a busy day yesterday, as you know. You were there. And we had the speech and we had lots of meetings with different leaders, including Pakistan and others. Other countries. In addition to businessmen all over the place. But I did get to see some of it. It's a hoax. It's a total hoax. It's a perfect conversation\nI think the team was really good. And-- the facts are all on our side. The Republican party has never been this unified. You saw that. 195 to nothing. I guess twice. In fact we got three Democrats voting for us. That was with the House. I think--\n--I really don't know. I think that-- if everybody tells the truth, it's perfect. All you have to do is read the transcript. Read-- if you take a look at the transcript-- and it's really two transcripts. It's-- you know, I had a first call which was perfect, and I had a second call which was perfect. You notice they don't mention the calls, though. They never mention the calls. They talk about everything but the calls. All they have to do is read the transcripts. I put it out all the time. The other thing is speak to the president of Ukraine. He's been great, I have to tell you. And his foreign minister's been great.\nThey constantly--say there was no pressure. They don't even know what we're doing. They think it's crazy. So they got the money. In fact they got it very early. President Obama gave them nothing. He gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and I gave them tank busters. You know, it's a disgraceful hoax.\nBut we do it.\nBut no, you asked me- the question.\nAnd I have to answer it—you are my friend--for too long.\nRight.\nWell, I appreciate that very much. We do. We have an incredible economy. The consumer has never been so rich. They-- you know, they're-- between the tax cuts and the regulation cuts-- people forget about regulation. I think it might have been more important than the tax cuts. But we have-- a consumer in the United States that has never done so well. And I think we're really poised to have I think we have tremendous potential. You know, we're at a point where we've done so well, I think we're going do much better. We have tremendous potential.\nThank you.\nWell, I think it's the opposite, actually. The Fed raised too fast interest. They brought up the rate too fast, and they didn't drop it fast enough. And that was very-- you know, that was a lot of increases, and it was a lot of increase. And I think it's really the opposite of what you're saying. Now they've dropped it, but it was very late. And you look at other countries where they actually have negative interest rates, negative in a positive way. I mean they're actually getting paid-- they make a loan and they end up--\n--getting paid.\nWell, they don't know yet. It's so new. I want to know who are the people that buy. Okay? Who are the people that buy and they invest in Germany and end up getting, you know, less money at the period of time -so I-- have to find these people. But-- no, if Germany-- and-- we're the most prime in the world. We're the leader in the world. We have the dollar, and the dollar's very strong. A lotta-- a lotta things are happening. But, you know, we're paying higher interest than other countries because of the Fed. If we were paying less, I would do it, and I'd pay off a lot of debt.\nI'd do a lot of things.\nWell, I don't want talk doghouse. I wish he didn't raise the rates. That was not what I thought would happen\nI think the rate should go down.\nKERNEN: Should go down further.\nNo, because I think the dollar's very, very strong. And I think the rate should go down. We have a very strong dollar, and that sounds good, and it is good in many ways, but it's very bad in terms of manufacturing. I've created almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. The past administration said manufacturing is dead, which I said, \"Tell me about that. How do you-- you can't do that.\" And we have had a tremendous success, but it's harder with a strong dollar. And-- I want this dollar to be strong. I want it to be so powerful. I want it to be great. But if you lower the interest rates, so many good things would happen.\nAnd one of the things I do want to do is pay off debt, and we're poised for tremendous growth. It'll really kick in toward the end of this year. But--\nwe're poised for tremendous growth.\nWe had many things.\nWell, it'll be higher than 2%. A lotta people are very thrilled with that. Me, I'm not, but we had a lot of bad things happen. Number one, the Fed was not good.\nAs far as I'm concerned. And that was a big blip that should not have taken place. It should not have happened. But it's one of those things. But we had Boeing. We had the big strike with General Motors. We had things happen that are very unusual to happen.\nIncluding some unbelievably powerful storms. You know, we were hit with storms. Now, with all of that, had we not done the big raise on interest, I think we would have been close to 4%, and I-- could see 5,000 to 10,000 points more on the Dow. But that was a killer when they raised the rate. It was just a big mistake. And they admit to it. They admit to it. I was right. I don't wanna be right, but I was right.\nOkay, I think the biggest thing about getting the deal with China-- number one, it's a great deal for us. It's an important deal for China, because they were-- you know, their supply chains were breaking. It was-- you know, it's been tough for them. The best thing that happened is we have two countries that like each other again, because it was getting pretty nasty. And, you know, they have taken advantage of our country for 30 years and we-- I was not going let it happen. And-- we've taken in billions and billions of dollars. The tariffs are still on, so I still have that negotiating chip. I have 25% tariffs on, and that's a great negotiating chip. And yes, we're starting phase two very soon. But the relationship that we have now with China is probably better than it's ever been. The relationship I have with President Xi, president for life. Okay? It's not bad. But the relationship I have with President Xi is, you know, I think extraordinary, considering he's for China, I'm for us.\nBut-- the deal is a phenomenal deal. We will take in $250 billion-- they're going to be buying $250 billion, and it could go a lot higher than that.\nOh yeah. Oh yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n--were part of the deal.\nYeah.\nAnd this is----manufacturing. This is-- technology. This-- phase one is a massive deal. And in the end, it's probably $250 billion, but it could go much higher than that. And just that alone, not even talking about the USMCA, which now we just got passed. In fact, when I go back I'll be signing it. It's all passed. And we had I believe 89 votes in the Senate, which is tremendous.\nYeah. Boris and I are friends and he wants to make a deal, and that's okay with me.\nI think they want it, they need it.\nOh yeah. We're starting. We've already started negotiating. And frankly, we're starting with Europe too. Europe is-- to be honest with you, Europe has been very, very tough to deal with. They've taken advantage of our country, the European Union, for many, many years. And I told them, we can't do it anymore. I met with them yesterday. I wanted to wait till I finished China, to be honest with you. I'm-- always like to be very transparent. I wanted to wait till I finished China. I didn't want to go with China and Europe at the same time. Now China's done, and I met with the new head of the European Commission, who's terrific. And had a great talk. But I said, look, if we don't get something, I'm going to have to take action, and the action will be a very high tariffs on their cars and other things that come into our country. Now, saying that, I don't want your audience to get nervous. They're going to make a deal, because they have to. They have to. They have no choice. But we've had a tremendous deficit for many, many years. Over $150 billion with Europe. And they are-- frankly, Jean-Claude was a friend of mine, but he was impossible to deal with. And I think it's going to be a lot better for Boris now too. You couldn't make a deal. It was very hard to make a deal. Now, I never played my cards, because I didn't want to do that again while I was doing China. I wanted to do China first. I wanted to do Mexico and Canada first. But now that we're all done-- and now what we do is we are going to do Europe. And I had a very good conversation. And I would be very surprised if I had to implement the tariffs.\nBig focus.\nWe're going to actually probably lower taxes, if you want to know the truth. You know, if you take a look at what we've done, we've cut taxes in half. And we've taken in more revenue substantially than we did when the taxes were high. Nobody can even believe it. But we take in more revenue with the big tax cuts-- I mean you were paying really 41% and we brought it down to 21%, and it's sort of lower than that--\nOh, absolutely. And--\nAnd one of the reasons I'd like to see the interest rates lowered, frankly, is because I'd like to refinance the debt and pay off the debt.\nWe're going have tremendous growth. Joe, when you have all of these trade deals the I've made-- don't forget, I made a $40 billion deal with Japan. I made a massive deal with South Korea. Nobody even knows what the number is, but, you know, it was a horrible deal, now it's a great deal. And then you add Mexico, you add China, you add Canada. You add all of these other countries. And we have about ten countries that we're dealing with. These deals were horrible. In many cases we didn't even have a deal. They just came in here and took advantage of our country. So-- we have massive potential, massive growth, and you'll see that toward the middle to the end of next year--\nGo ahead, Joe. They--\nAll very different. You have Mini Mike is spending a lot of money. He's got no chance. But he's got a tremendous-- you know, he used to be a friend of mine until I ran for politics, and then-- he went a little off. You should see some of the nice things he said about me before I ran. They're like the nicest. But he had a deal with Hillary Clinton that he was going to become secretary of State. It was very simple. People know that. And he-- wasn't going to happen. It was going to go to Terry McAuliffe. I mean so they were playing with Michael. And-- it's too bad, but he's spending a fortune. He's making a lot of broadcasters wealthy. And he's getting nowhere. His ratings are terrible. His-- you look at his numbers. I don't know if Joe's going to limp across the line, but you-- I watch him. I s-- watch him speaking. He can't put together a sentence, but it could be him. And it could be Crazy Bernie. I don't know who it's going to be. Whoever it is, I'm ready.\nGo ahead.\nYeah.\nVery disappointing company. This is one of the great companies of the world, let's say as of a year ago, and then all of a sudden things happen. I am so disappointed in Boeing-- had a tremendous impact. You know, when you talk about growth, it's so big that some people say it's more than a half a point of GDP. So Boeing-- big, big disappointment to me. Big disappointment.\nI like them a lot. I think we should do some encryption. I think we should-- we should start finding some of the bad people out there that we can do with Apple. I think it's very important. Frankly, I've helped them a lot. I've given them waivers, because I want them-- it's a great company, but it made a big difference. Now, you know, they compete against Samsung. Mostly Samsung. I guess that would be their number one competitor. That's from South Korea. It's not fair, because we have a trade deal with South Korea, so Samsung would get the no waiver. And they would-- they would have to pay-- tariffs. So I did waivers, but I want them to help us a little bit. They-- you know, Apple has to help us. And I'm very strong on it. They have the keys to so many criminals and criminal minds, and we can do things. When they had the problem with the-- recently in Florida. I won't go into it, because it's so horrible.\nBut they could have given us that information. It would have been very helpful.\nNo, no. I understand--\n--you know what, I understand both sides of the argument.\nYou're dealing with drug lords and you're dealing with terrorists, and if you're dealing with murderers, I don't care. We have to get--\n--we have to find out what's going on.\nWell, I met him-- and he told me that I'm number one in the world in Facebook. He sat down. He said, \"Congratulations. You're number one.\" Now, I wouldn't be able to say that unless it was--\nI'd rather him just do whatever he's going to do. You know, he's done-- he's done a hell of a job, when you think of it. And-- he's going to do what he has to do. I heard he was going to run for president. That wouldn't be too frightening, I don't think. But he does have that monster behind him. He said, \"You're number one,\" and I said, \"That's really nice.\" It's always nice to be number one. You know who number two is?\nModi of India. But he has 1.5 billion people. I have 350. So-- Modi. And we're going there very soon, too--\nAnd by the way, our relationship with India, and again with China and with Japan and with so many countries, is better than it's ever been. Literally better than it's ever been.\nWell-- you have to give him credit. I spoke to him very recently, and he's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And-- he does good at rockets too, by the way. I never saw where the engines come down with no wings, no anything, and they're landing. I said I've never seen that before. And I was worried about him, because he's one of our great geniuses, and we have to protect our genius. You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison and we have to protect all of these people that-- came up with originally the light bulb and-- the wheel and all of these things. And he's one of our very smart people and we want to-- we want to cherish those people. That's very important. But he's done a very good job. Shocking how well-- you know, how it's come so fast. I mean you go back a year and they were talking about the end of the company. And now all of a sudden they're talking about these great things. He's going to be building a very big plant in the United States. He has to, because we help him, so he has to help us.\nGo ahead.\nAt some point they will be. We have tremendous growth. We're going to have tremendous growth. This next year I-- it'll be toward the end of the year. The growth is going to be incredible. And at the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look, cause it's such a--\n--big percentage.\nWell, we're going-- we're going look. We also have-- assets that we've never had. I mean we've never had growth like this. We never had a consumer that was taking in, through-- different means, over $10,000 a family. We never had the kind of-- the kind of things that we have. Look, our country is the hottest in the world. We have the hottest economy in the world. We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. African American, Asian American. Hispanics are doing so incredibly. Best they've ever done. Black. Best they've ever done. African American. The numbers are incredible. The poverty numbers. The unemployment and the employment. There's-- there is a difference, actually. But the unemployment and employment numbers for African Americans are the best we've ever had. You know, we just-- came up with a chart, and it was a very important to number to me. African American youth has the highest, by far, unemployment. The best unemployment numbers that they've ever had. And the best employment numbers. Right now we have almost 160 million people working in the United States, and we've never even been close to that, Joe.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.\nAppreciate it.\nGreat Joe.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-joe-kernen-cnbcs-squawk-box-davos-switzerland"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Davos, Switzerland", "Date": "2020-01-22", "Text": "Thank you very much. Please come on up, Roberto and Larry. Robert, Steve, come on up.\nGood afternoon. We've had a tremendous 2 days here. We'll be heading back right after this conference, and I've just concluded some additional meetings. We've had a lot of them. And Davos has treated us really beautifully. It's been a tremendous success. Everyone is talking about America's unprecedented economic success. It's really the talk of the town, so to speak.\nSince my election, America has gained over 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate is now the lowest in over half a century. The average unemployment rate for my administration is the lowest of any U.S. President in recorded history, which is very nice; we have some good ones. We have some bad ones too, by the way.\nUnemployment rates among African American, Hispanic American, Asian Americans has reached a record low in the history of our country—the lowest. African American youth unemployment has reached the lowest in the history of our country. So proud of that. African American poverty numbers have plummeted to their lowest rate ever recorded. Doing really well.\nUnemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. And the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached its alltime record low also. These are incredible numbers, Rob.\nWorkers without a high school diploma have received the—and achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever in recorded history. And that's so important. Without a high school diploma—we have a lot of great people that don't have a high school diploma. So we have record-low unemployment.\nA record number of young Americans are now employed. We have the highest number of people working in our country that we've ever had before. We've never had anything even close. We're almost up to 160 million.\nAnd we've lifted 10 million people off of welfare. And you know all about food stamps; we talk about it all the time. But millions and millions of people don't need food stamps anymore. It's not that we've lifted them off, which we have, but they don't need them anymore. And they have jobs. They're doing really well.\nThank you very much. Great. Thank you.\nLarry, please. Larry Kudlow.\nThank you very much, Larry. I mean, when you think that, soon—it will start pretty soon. It's already started, to a certain extent. I asked them to do it. China is going to be purchasing more than $250 billion worth of goods from our country. That's massive. Those are numbers that nobody has ever heard of before. And that number can grow. It can grow. With time, it's going to grow substantially, I predict.\nAnd then, you have the USMCA—Mexico, Canada—and that's massive numbers we're talking about there. And we made a deal with Japan—$40 billion. And we made a deal with South Korea. That's a tremendous deal also. That was a horrible deal, and we turned it into a really good deal. So it was really something.\nWhile we were in Davos—most of you know this—we met with the world leaders—various world leaders, including the President of the European Commission, who we're going to start negotiating a trade deal with, because the European Commission was, frankly, in many ways, tougher than China. I say that respectfully, but that's the way it is. They've taken advantage for a long time.\nAnd so we're going to have a deal. I suspect we're going to be able to make a deal. Otherwise, we'll have to do something else. And they'll—I think they're going to make a deal. They haven't wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me. The President of the Swiss Confederation, who's been very nice and terrific; the President of Kurdistan—we had a tremendous meeting; along with President Salih of Iraq, Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, and President Ghani of Afghanistan.\nIn addition, we met with many of the business leaders, both at breakfast today and lunch yesterday and dinner yesterday. Many of you were at those meetings, at least for a little while. And tremendous numbers of jobs will be coming into the United States.\nA lot of these leaders—these are the biggest business leaders in the world, and this morning was very inspirational. I mean, these companies are really going to expand. And it was a request of mine, but what we did—we've been very good to them. They're all doing very well.\nAnd we have companies from Europe, companies from Asia now coming to the United States. \"That's where the action is,\" as one of them said. \"That's where the action is.\" So it's really been great.\nAnd now we'll be going—we'll be leaving and going back to Washington. Okay?\nGo ahead.\nWell, I'll tell you the way I look at it: It's a total hoax. It's a disgrace. They talked about their tremendous case. And it's all done—their tremendous case. They had no case. It's all a hoax. It's a con job. Like Schiff, he's a corrupt politician. Now, I'll leave that to the Senate. The Senate is going to have to answer that. I have great respect for the Senate, as a body and many of the individuals. I have great respect. So I'll leave that to the Senate.\nBut this is the greatest witch hunt. This started from the day I came down with the future First Lady. The day we came down the escalator, this started. And I watched the—they've been driven crazy. You know what's driven them crazy? All of these record numbers on unemployment—African American, Asian American. You take a look. Hispanic American is numbers that nobody is even believing. They look at all of this. They're looking at this tremendous success, the likes of which they've never seen before in this country. They've never seen anything like this. And it's driven the Democrats crazy.\nAs Congressman Green said—Al Green. He's a beauty. As Congressman Green said, \"We've got to beat him by impeachment because we can't beat him in the election.\" And I hope that's true, because, honestly, they can't beat me in the election. I don't think they can. I know what they're—I know what I'll be running against. One way or the other, it's one of them. And I think we're going to do very well.\nBut I think we're going to do well because nobody has done, in the first 3 years—less than 3 years, because a lot of these numbers were taken from 2 months ago; they ended 2 months ago. In less than 3 years, nobody has done the kind of numbers we've done.\nSo I'm going to head back, and I'll be watching it, but it's really going to be up to the Senate. We're going to have them make that determination.\nOh, that's very nice.\nI didn't say \"anger.\" I said \"anger management.\"\nHow old is she?\nOh. That's good.\nShe beat me out on TIME Magazine. [Laughter]Q.But did you hear from other world leaders and business leaders who said that they think that she has a message that you should listen to?\nNo, I didn't, actually. But I would have loved to have seen her speak. I did not.\nNo, not at all. I think what is—I think aspects of it are. I think that some people are—they put it at a level that is, you know, unrealistic, to a point you can't live your lives.\nWe want to have the cleanest water on Earth. We want to have the cleanest air on Earth. Our numbers, as you saw—we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good, our environmental numbers. Our water numbers, our numbers on air are tremendous.\nWe have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. When we're clean and beautiful and everything is good, but you have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can't believe, I mean, I think Greta ought to focus on those places.\nBut we are doing better right now than we've ever done, in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers. We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean, where thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us, and that's put there by other countries. So I think Greta has to start working on those other countries.\nBy the way, congratulations on your show.\nThey made a very wise decision.\nOh, good.\nArticles of Impeachment/The President's Telephone Conversations With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/Trade Negotiations/U.S. Assistance to Ukraine\nWell, you've got to talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you: There's nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with a very fine gentleman from the Ukraine, and it was based on that. People don't even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings that I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time, in Washington.\nAnd I watched—they don't talk about my conversation. They don't talk about my transcripts. Remember this: When Schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to Congress and the world—and it was a totally phony story—then I released the transcript. There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There was—wait, wait. Otherwise, I won't do your show. [Laughter] Wait. There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared. And when they saw this transcript, they said, \"We've got problems.\" But they went ahead because they were already there, because they had a phony, concocted story made up.\nSo here's the story: Did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate. The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The Department of Justice has looked at it, given it a signoff. There was nothing wrong.\nThey never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn't think we had transcribers or we had it transcribed or taped. But they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats, because they say: \"Wait a minute. This is much different than Shifty Schiff told us.\"\nSo we're doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material.\nWell, it depends. But if you take a look at this, and from what everybody tells me, all I do is, I'm honest. I make great deals. I've made great deals for our country. Now we're working with the WTO. You're probably surprised by that, but this has been a long-term, abusive situation to the U.S. I make great deals for our country, and they're honest deals.\nAnd when you read that transcription—and, by the way, it wasn't one call; it was two calls. Nobody likes to talk about that. There was one call, which was perfect, and then there was a second call—I guess, a couple of months later—which was perfect.\nThe President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call, and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good—now, here's the other thing: They got their money long before schedule. They got all their money. What nobody says—this is very important to me: Why isn't Germany paying? Why isn't U.K. paying? Why isn't France paying? Why aren't the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker—United States? That's one.\nAnd the other thing I wanted to check very carefully—and it's very important—is corruption. And we do that too. This was a perfect call, and I think we're doing very well.\nChina-U.S. Trade Relations\nWe are discussing that already, yes. We would like to see if we can do something. But again, we're doing a trade deal, and it's a very big deal. Phase one is done. Phase two is being discussed.\nWe are discussing aspects of your question, yes.\nNo, go ahead, please.\nI can live either way. I can live——\nI'll tell you what I think: It's such a hoax. I think it's so bad for our country. When we have the head of the World Trade Organization here, and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect, that nobody talks about. I never see them talking about the transcription. I never see them talking about the call, because there's nothing to say.\nYou read it—somebody should just sit there and read it. And everybody's going to say, \"You mean that's an impeachable event?\" If that were impeachable, Lyndon Johnson would have had to leave office in his first day. Kennedy would have had to leave office his first day. It's a hoax. And you understand it's a hoax better than anybody. It's a hoax. And that's the way it is.\nYes, go ahead.\nNo, I heard that they had headaches, and a couple of other things. But I would say, and I can report it is not very serious. Not very serious.\nThey told me about it numerous days later. You'd have to ask Department of Defense. No, I don't consider them very serious injuries, relative to other injuries that I've seen.\nI've seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our troops. I've seen people with no legs and with no arms. I've seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, that war—in fact, many cases put—those bombs put there by Soleimani, who is no longer with us. I consider them to be really bad injuries.\nNo, I do not consider that to be bad injuries. No.\nEuropean Union-U.S. Trade/Aerospace Industry/China-U.S. Trade/British Exit From the European Union\nYes.\nI have a timeline.\nYes. Great question, actually. I don't have a timeline; but maybe I do in my own mind. They have to move relatively quickly, but they have to treat us fairly.\nThe European Union was formed pretty much for this reason, I suspect, you know, if you really think about it. Why was it formed? They formed their airplane company, which does very nicely, and now is doing better than ever, because Boeing has not had a good time of it. They have—they'd better start recovering fast. I hope they do. They have some good people in there now. They have great people in the company, but they have some good people leading it now. So, hopefully, that will be taken care of.\nBut I—no, I have a date in my mind, and it's a fairly quick date. And if we're unable to make a deal, then we'll do even better. We'll do even better.\nBut they haven't treated us right. Look, the United States has been losing $150 billon, and more, for many years—$150 billion. More. I mean, really, more than that—with the European Union. They have trade barriers where you can't trade. They have tariffs all over the place. They make it impossible.\nThey are, frankly, more difficult to do business with than China. We have a great relationship with China now. We had some testy moments, very testy. Beyond testy. Worse than a lot of people would understand. But we got it done, and I think phase two will go nicely also.\nBut with the European Union—and frankly, I'll be honest, I wanted to wait until I finished China before I went to work on, respectfully, Europe.\nBut Europe, you know, it's so beautiful. I guess a lot of us come, indirectly, from Europe. Isn't that nice? But they are actually more difficult to do business with than China. All you have to do is ask Boris. But I think Boris is going to be okay too. I think he's going to come out great. I think he has—he had a lot of guts. He's done a terrific job. I think he's in a good position, which they would have never been able to do before Boris.\nI have a date. I have a very specific date in my mind.\nBefore. I think—I think we'll have a deal before.\nYes, I think so. I mean, they have to do that. I mean, I don't want to—look, I'm not saying it from strength or from weakness; I'm just saying they have to do it.\nThey wanted to make a deal. This—our Nation, our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to him. And then, they said, \"No, no, we like it the way it is.\" Of course, they like it the way it is; they're making $150 billion-plus, right?\nAnd, as you know, President Bush was desperate to make a deal. They wouldn't even talk to him.\nMe, they're talking to, and we'll have a deal. If we don't have a deal, we'll do even better.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead.\nRestrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S.\nYes.\nSo we have a travel ban. It's a very powerful ban. And a lot of—I heard a reporter recently say, \"He lost the ban in court.\" They didn't say that we won it in the Supreme Court. I'd say that's a little deceptive, John [John Roberts, Fox News], wouldn't you? He said, \"He lost the travel ban.\" I didn't lose the travel ban. The travel ban was lost in the lower courts and won in the Supreme Court, 2 years ago.\nNo, we are—we're adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe. You see what's going on in the world. Our country has to be safe.\nSo we have a very strong travel ban, and we'll be adding a few countries to it.\nWell, no, you're going to—it's going to be announced very shortly. Okay?\nJohn. Yes, John.\nSenate Impeachment Trial/Former National Security Adviser John R. Bolton/The President's July 25 Telephone Conversation With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine/The President's Popularity\nWell, you're asking a lot of questions. [Laughter]\nFirst of all, Jerrold Nadler, I've known him a long time. He's a sleazebag; everybody knows that. Pat Cipollone is a high-quality human being. I was very impressed with Pat. He had great emotion yesterday. Pat is a brilliant guy, but I've never seen that emotion. And that's real emotion. That's because he knows this is a hoax. And I was very proud of the job he did.\nI've known Jerry Nadler for a long time. He's opposed many of my jobs. I got them all built, very successfully built in New York. But—so we have yet another fight. Isn't it amazing? Isn't it surprising? Isn't it amazing?\nBut if you look at, you know, other aspects or other parts of your question, I think that the—I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people.\nThe problem with John is that it's a national security problem. You know, you can't have somebody who's at national security—and, if you think about it, John, he knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader, and it's not very positive, and then I have to deal on behalf of the country? It's going to be very hard. It's going to make the job very hard.\nHe knows other things. And I don't know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not, you know. And so you don't like people testifying when they didn't leave on good terms, and that was due to me, not due to him. And so we'll see what happens.\nBut when you have a national security—where you could call it \"Presidential prerogative.\" You could just call it—the way I look at it, I call it \"national security\"—for national security reasons. \"Executive privilege,\" they say. So that would—John would certainly fit into that. When you're a National Security Adviser—like this gentleman is doing a fantastic job, Robert—I just think it's very hard. And I've always gotten along—I've actually gotten along with John Bolton. He didn't get along with other people—a lot of other people. But when he knows my thoughts on certain people in other governments—and we're talking about massive trade deals, and war and peace, and all these different things that we talk about—that's really a very important national security problem, I think.\nHaving somebody—other people—Mick Mulvaney is probably around here someplace. I'd love to have Mick go, but I think that he's really expressed himself very well when he did a Chris Wallace interview. That was a very, very powerful interview. That was a long, tough—Chris is a tough interviewer. A very talented guy. And you know, I think it's not much he can add. He's been great.\nI would like to have—I'll tell you what I don't like though—I'd love to have Mike Pompeo testify. But again, that's a national security problem. But I'd love to have Mike Pompeo, but it's a national security problem.\nI'd love to have Rick Perry. Rick Perry has asked me: \"I'd love to testify. Please, let me testify.\" Because he knows this is all a hoax. He understands it better than most. And Rick Perry would love to testify. But we're dealing with national security.\nWe're dealing with one other thing: Our country has been tied up with this hoax from the day I came down the escalator. We've been fighting it. I've been fighting it from the day I've been elected. I would say probably long before—it could be long before I came down the escalator that—some people have said that, which is hard to believe.\nWait. Wait, John.\nIt's hard to believe. We've been fighting this. I would rather have—personally, I'd rather go the long route. It's horrible for our country. Our country has to get back to business.\nWe have people that are corrupt, like Adam Schiff, who misquotes—I don't mean \"misquotes\"—makes up a statement. He had no idea that I was going to release the transcript. He never thought I'd do that. And for that, I thank the President of Ukraine, because we got their approval. He had no idea I was going to do that.\nBut these are corrupt people, some of them. And some of them are just playing the political game. But if you look at the poll numbers, my poll numbers are the highest they've ever been. If you look at the funding numbers, if you look at what—the money raised by the Republican Party has just set a record. Nobody has ever done this before. It's because of the impeachment hoax.\nThree?\nThat means six.\nSix for the family. [Laughter]\nGo ahead. No, go ahead.Businessman Lev Parnas/Personal Attorney to the President Rudolph W. Giuliani/Former Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr/Impeachment of Former President William J. Clinton/Senate Impeachment Trial/Investigation Into Russia's Interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election/News Media\nNo, he's a con man. Okay, you ready? Let me answer that one first.\n——other than he's sort of like a groupie. He shows up at fundraisers. Okay? So I don't know anything about him.\nI watched Rudy. Rudy is a terrific person—great crime fighter; the best mayor in the history of New York City, by far; solved the crime problem in New York. And I think it's very unfair the way the media has treated Rudy Giuliani.\nI will say this: Parnas I don't know, other than he probably contributed to the campaign, along with tens of thousands of other people. And I take—or, I mean, I was—this weekend I was taking pictures with hundreds of people. And they—they're—they contribute to the Republican Party. And I stand there, and I take pictures. And every once in a while, I'll look at somebody—I say, \"Gee, I wonder when that picture is going to be in the New York Times or the Washington Post or on Fox.\" You know, so it's one of those things.\nI think Rudy is a high-quality person.\nBecause I don't want there to be a conflict. I'd love to have Rudy on my team. But you know, he could be a witness at some point, if this whole sham continues. I would love to have Rudy on the team. He—Rudy is on my team, just so you understand. But I'd love to have him up there. But it could be that he'd have a conflict. It could be.\nBut Rudy Giuliani is somebody that I think the press has been very unfair to. Greatest mayor in the history of New York—think of it. And one of the greatest crime fighters of the last hundred years. And he hates to see what's happening, because he knows corruption, really, better than anybody. Okay? Go ahead.\nSo Ken Starr is a terrific man. I did make that statement, because, frankly, I didn't think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I thought it was terrible. I didn't know Ken Starr, but I didn't think that Bill Clinton should be impeached—should have been impeached. And I was pretty vocal about that. I didn't know Ken, but what I did know is he was very smart. He was very tough. He was very talented. But in a certain way, I was sticking up for Clinton—for Bill Clinton. And you know, I felt—I sort of still feel that way. I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things, a lot of bad things.\nNow, with me, there's no lying. There's no nothing. They have nothing. They don't even have a crime. They say, \"This is the only one that's ever been impeached, and he didn't commit a crime.\" I didn't commit a crime. And then, you get into high crimes and misdemeanors. But I didn't commit a crime.\nSo no, I have great respect for Ken. But I didn't think, frankly, that Bill Clinton should have been impeached.\nI'd love to go. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be beautiful?\nI don't know. I'd sort of love—sit right in the front row and stare in their corrupt faces. [Laughter] I'd love to do it.\nI don't know. Don't keep talking, because I may—you may convince me to do it. [Laughter]\nI think they might have a problem. [Laughter]\nI think they might. And by the way, I think—I think they've all—I think they've done a really good job. And I think the other side has so lied. I watched the lies from Adam Schiff. He'll stand, he'll look at a microphone, and he'll talk like he so aggrieved. These two guys—these are major sleazebags. They're very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest people.\nWhen somebody will make up a statement that I made, when—you remember the statement. Eight times. \"Quid pro quo.\" Eight times. Think of it. How can you say—eight times? That would mean I was asking somebody eight different times for the same thing? What kind of a conversation would that be? If you asked once, that'd be fine. If you asked twice, that would have been—how can you ask eight times? It would—they would say you're a Looney Tune, right?\nAnd then, he said—I think he finished by saying: \"Don't call me. I'll call you.\" That I said that. He made that statement: \"Don't call me. I'll call you.\" And he didn't say he made it up.\nNow, ultimately, he had to, in a sense, apologize. He can hardly apologize. But he had to apologize, because, fortunately, we had a tape. We had the transcripts. I am so happy that I had the transcripts, because it showed he's a liar, and he's a fraud. And they continue to just go on and on.\nBut this has happened to me with the Russian hoax. This has happened to me—I called it the \"witch hunt.\" Greatest witch hunt in American history. And the Mueller report, which exonerated, totally—there was no collusion after all that. Two years, there was no collusion. And then, what happened? Jill Stein from the Green Party gets called a \"Russian agent\" by Crooked Hillary. And then, Tulsi Gabbard—I don't know either of them, but I know they're not Russian agents—gets called a \"Russian agent.\"\nThis is what these people do; they demean. And the press plays in, because the press, largely, is their partner. And you know, one thing—if we could straighten out the press in our country, we would have a place that would be so incredible. The press is so dishonest, so corrupt. I read it all the time—the stories. I don't mind bad stories when—I deserve bad story sometimes.\nBut when I do something great or good, let it be written about good. Same thing with other people. The corruption in the media—as I call it, the \"fake news\" media—is unbelievable. And, hopefully, everybody is going to sort of learn a lesson.\nPeople got Pulitzer Prizes for their coverage of me. And it turned out they were totally wrong. Other people—Sean Hannity, Rushbo—a lot of great people, a lot of great writers. They got it right. They didn't get Pulitzer Prizes, but they got it right.\nThe Russian hoax was a terrible thing. The dossier was a phony deal paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, and used in the FISA courts, totally illegally. No, it's a terrible thing that happened.\nThis was a takedown attempt at a sitting President of the United States, and we caught them. So let's see what happens.\nI don't see it. No, I don't see it. No, I'm—you know, a very excellent writer, Bob Woodward—I guess he's doing another book on Trump, but this time, I'll actually give him an interview. He said, \"You're enjoying this, aren't you?\" I said, \"No, I'm not enjoying it.\" He said: \"No, you act like you're winning and you won. You're actually enjoying it.\" I said: \"I'm not enjoying it. I'm doing it because it's very important, what I'm doing.\"\nI consider what I've done here, with this whole witch hunt, from day one—with the insurance policy; with the horrible statements made between Strzok and Page; and McCabe; and Comey, who lied to Congress and did so many other bad things. He lied, and he leaked.\nWhen I finish, I think that this is going to go down as one of the greatest things I've done for our country. These are bad, corrupt people. These are bad people and very bad for our country.\nThank you very much, everybody.\nThank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-davos-switzerland"}
{"Title": "Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News", "Date": "2020-02-02", "Text": "Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you.\nWell, it's been very unfair. From the day I won. And I really say from far before the day I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our future First Lady who's doing such a good job. To be honest with you, I think it's, it's probably, it probably started from there. It's been a very, very unfair process, Um the Mueller Report, Russia, Russia, Russia. As you say, which was total nonsense. It was all nonsense. The whole thing was nonsense. But it was a very unfair and mostly it was unfair to my family. I mean my family suffered because of all of this, and many other families suffered also. It was a very, very. It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.\nWell I'd like to, but it's pretty hard when you think about it because it's been such um I use the word witch hunt - I use the word hoax. I see the hatred. I see the level -- they don't care about fairness, they don't care about lying. You look at the lies, you look at the reports that were done that were so false. The, um, the level of hypocrisy. So I'm not sure that they can do it, to be honest. I think they just want to win and it doesn't matter how they win. In the meantime, I really believe this administration, me and this administration, we've done more than any administration in the history of our country. We've rebuilt our military. We've cut taxes at the highest amount ever in the history of our country. I mean you see what's going on. There's a revolution going on in this country. I mean a positive revolution. So African-American, Hispanic-American, Asian-American. We have the best numbers we've ever had. African-American, the poverty numbers are now reversed. And they're the best that they've ever had. So I don't know how anybody could possibly beat me with that vote. So we'll see how it does.\nSo Sean, I think that with the economy being the best probably it's ever been in the history of our country. I mean it is the best it's ever been. The unemployment numbers are the best. I should be up by 25 points. What they've done is they've really -- all the media. I call it the fake news, and it is fake news, so much of it. And a lot of the fakeness is they don't want to report the good stuff. They don't want to report that the economy is good.\nNo, I'm gonna have it. It's going to be done. We're gonna talk about the achievements that we've made. Nobody has made achievements like we've made, so many different things, I'm so proud of what we've done for our vets with choice, we got them choice, we got them accountability, where we can take care of our vets. Where we can get rid of people who aren't taking care of our vets.\nI just think of sleepy. I just watch him. He's sleepy. Sleepy Joe.\nWhere's Hunter? Where is he? He made millions of dollars. He went from having no job, no income, he had nothing. As you know he had a very sad experience in the military. He has nothing, to making millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Not just from Ukraine, from China and from other countries. How can you do this? This is crooked as hell. What they did is very dishonest.\nWell, I think he's a communist. I mean you know, look. I think of communism when I think of Bernie. Now you could say socialist, but didn't he get married in Moscow? And that's wonderful, Moscow is wonderful.\nYou don't think necessarily, well, whatever. But you don't necessarily think in terms of marriage, Moscow. And it's wonderful. I'm not knocking it, but I think of Bernie sort of as a socialist but far beyond a socialist.\nAt least he's true to what he believes, that's one thing because you mention now, Elizabeth Warren. She's not true to it. I call her fairy tale because everything is a fairy tale. That's how Pocahontas got started. Everything is a fairy tale. This woman can't tell the truth.\nUh, very little. I just think of little. You know, now he wants a box for the debates to stand on. Okay, it's okay, there's nothing wrong. You can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, okay? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that? Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box?\nThe other thing that's very interesting, Cory Booker and all these people couldn't get any of the things that Bloomberg is getting now. I think it's very unfair for the Democrats, but I would love to run against Bloomberg. I would love it.\nI think of emails, I think the email scandal, how she got away with that is a disgrace. I think it's a disgrace.\nUh, I think she's a very confused, very nervous woman. I don't think she wanted to do this, I think she really knew what was going to happen and it's her worst nightmare has happened. I don't think she's going to be there too long, either. I think that the radical left -- and she's sort of radical left, too, by the way -- but I think the radical left is going to take over.\nI have to sit back and watch...\nI mean I'm watching and I have little nicknames for all of them.\nBut they're accurate. I mean they're very accurate. You look at Sleepy Joe. What's going on with him? He's having a hard time. You look at Bernie. I call him crazy Bernie. They're now sort of rigging the election against him again. I see what's going on. They're rigging it against him.\nWell, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. We have a tremendous relationship with China, which is a very positive thing. Getting along with China, getting along with Russia, getting along with these countries...\nOh yeah, no we're offering them tremendous help. We have the best in the world for that. We've done a tremendous job in many other instances also on that even recently. No, no, we've offered China help, but we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the Coronavirus. So we're gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.\nWell, it is. It's sort of a little bit of a microcosm of life. Ya know you have winners, you have champions, you have people that you expect to see that final play. You have great coaches like Belichick. You have people that you expect more out of, and often times they produce, but then you have people that you just don't expect they're gonna do it and often times they don't. It's a microcosm of life.\nThank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-fox-news-2"}
{"Title": "Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union", "Date": "2020-02-04", "Text": "The President.Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nMadam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens: Three years ago, we launched the great American comeback. Tonight, I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again. America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright.\nThe years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.\nIn just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back.\nI am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons, I say to the people of our great country and to the Members of Congress: The state of our Union is stronger than ever before.\nThe vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society, one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.\nFrom the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the U.S. economy, slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-American. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed very, very high.\nSince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than Government experts projected during the previous administration. The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. [Applause] True. If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success.\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an alltime low. African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.\nThe unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years. And last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added. The veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an alltime low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in U.S. history. A record number of young Americans are now employed.\nUnder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare. In 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 years of my administration, 3.5 million people—working-age people—have joined the workforce.\nSince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent, three times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast, and wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16-percent pay increase since my election. This is a blue-collar boom. Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.\nSince my election, U.S. stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our Nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record. It is something that every country in the world is looking up to. They admire. Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs.\nAll of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent and even more.\nJobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven't seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It's all working.\nOpportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, and his family. He was homeless. But then, Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony. Thank you, Tony.\nOur roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn't be done, but I got it done, and the people in this room got it done.\nThanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, America is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.\nLikewise, we are restoring our Nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never, ever be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built. Companies are not leaving; they are coming back to the U.S.A. The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is, and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is. One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA's adoption, our Nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so, and then absolutely nothing happened. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises: We did our job.\nSix days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying American auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level, but also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity. We will have that: fairness and reciprocity. And I say that, finally, because it's been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America's labor unions.\nI also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China's massive theft of America's jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the U.S.A.\nFor decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we've ever had with China, including with President Xi. They respect what we've done, because, quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, \"That's enough.\" Now we want to rebuild our country, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are rebuilding our country.\nAs we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That's why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba.\nWe are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.\nHere this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the Gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó. Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland. Thank you, Mr. President. Great honor. Thank you very much.\nPlease take this message back that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you very much.\nSocialism destroys nations. But always remember: Freedom unifies the soul.\nTo safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment, and it's all made right here in the U.S.A.\nWe are also getting our allies, finally, to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from the other NATO members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the United States Armed Forces. It's called the Space Force. Very important.\nIn the Gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman. And what he wants so badly—13 years old—Iain Lanphier. He's an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy, and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says: \"Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world.\" [Laughter]\nBut sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all. Charles McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen—the first Black fighter pilots—and he also happens to be Iain's great-grandfather. Incredible story.\nAfter more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our Nation salutes you. Thank you, sir.\nFrom the pilgrims to the Founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma, and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children's future.\nMembers of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people. The people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first.\nThe next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students, 18 States have created school choice in the form of Opportunity Scholarships. The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list.\nOne of those students is Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia. Janiyah. Janiyah's mom, Stephanie, is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future. But last year, that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania's Governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children. Janiyah and Stephanie are in the Gallery. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. Thank you very much.\nBut, Janiyah, I have some good news for you, because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announce tonight that an \"opportunity scholarship\" has become available, it's going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice.\nNow I call on Congress to give 1 million American children the same opportunity Janiyah has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunities Act, because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.\nEvery young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow. For this reason, our magnificent First Lady has launched the \"Be Best\" initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation: online, in school, and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America's children. Thank you very much. My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our Pledge to American Workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans.\nMy budget also contains an exciting vision for our Nation's high schools. Tonight I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America.\nTo expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\nA good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality health care system on Earth. Before I took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60-percent less expensive and better.\nI've also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will always protect your Medicare, and we will always protect your Social Security. Always.\nThe American patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an Executive order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than health care reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.\nBut as we work to improve Americans' health care, there are those who want to take away your health care, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely.\nAudience members.Boo!\nThe President.One hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our health care system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care.\nOver 130 legislators in this Chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our Nation by providing free taxpayer-funded health care to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors, and that our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. That is what is happening in California and other States. Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money.\nIf forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free health care to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free Government health care for illegal aliens.\nThis will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year, we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed.\nMy administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before. And I was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down. And working together, Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I've been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done quickly and properly. I'm calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk, and I will sign it into law immediately.\nAudience members.H.R. 3! H.R. 3! H.R. 3!\nThe President.With unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 percent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, Wisconsin is down 10 percent, and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.\nProtecting Americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese Government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\nWe have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health. And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade.\nAlmost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage-4 advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country.\nAnd, Rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our Nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nI will now ask the First Lady of the United States to present you with the honor. Please.\n[At this point, the First Lady presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to radio show host Rush H. Limbaugh III, who was seated beside her in the House Gallery.]\nAudience member.Thank you, Rush! [Applause]\nThe President.Rush and Kathryn, congratulations. Thank you, Kathryn.\nAs we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017, doctors at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter. Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life. Today, Ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother Robin in the Gallery. Ellie and Robin, we are glad to have you with us tonight.\nEllie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. And thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. It's an incredible thing. Thank you very much.\nOur goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I'm asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America's youngest patients. That is why I'm also calling upon Members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies. Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God.\nAs we support America's moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the Federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now I call on the Congress to pass the bipartisan Advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our Nation.\nForty million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. I've also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality childcare, enabling 17 States to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait-lists altogether. And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.\nTo protect the environment, days ago, I announced that the United States will join the 1 Trillion Trees initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world.\nWe must also rebuild America's infrastructure. I ask you to pass Senator John Barrasso's highway bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land. I'm also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including and especially in rural America.\nA better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our Nation's heroic ICE officers. Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.\nTragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens.\nAudience members.Boo!\nThe President.In sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed.\nJust 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York's sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE's detainer request, his victim would still be alive today.\nThe State of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole State to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants—a very terrible sanctuary—with catastrophic results. Here is just one tragic example. In December 2018, California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. But as required by California's Sanctuary Law, local authorities released him.\nDays later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work. He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims is—a terrible, terrible situation; died—51-year-old American named Rocky Jones.\nRocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers, who loved him more than anything else in the world. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand?\nAudience member.Jody!\nThe President.Jody, thank you. Jody our hearts weep for your loss, and we will not rest until you have justice. Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and States when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices.\nI ask Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not criminal aliens.\nIn the last 3 years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers. And I have signed nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and all around the globe. My administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the United States.\nBefore I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. My administration has ended catch-and-release. If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country.\nVery importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since May, dropping 8 straight months in a row. And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise, and the border crossings are down, and going down very rapidly.\nLast year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to Deputy Chief of Border Patrol, and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz, please stand. A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of Border Patrol and ICE. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nTo build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.\nWith every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom. Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell—thank you, Mitch—and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new Federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. And we have many in the pipeline. [Laughter]\nMy administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools. In America, we don't punish prayer. We don't tear down crosses. We don't ban symbols of faith. We don't muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion, we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the glory of God.\nJust as we believe in the First Amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am President, I will always protect your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America's manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the Moon will be American astronauts, using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.\nMy administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.\nLast week, I announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future.\nThree years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS—the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi—is dead.\nWe are joined this evening by Carl and Marsha Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. She once wrote: \"Some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love. I find God in suffering. I've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering.\" In 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla. She was just 26 years old.\nOn the night that U.S. Special Forces Operations ended al-Baghdadi's miserable life, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, received a call in the Situation Room. He was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name: \"Task Force 8–14.\" It was a reference to a special day: August 14, Kayla's birthday. Carl and Marsha, America's warriors never forgot Kayla, and neither will we. Thank you.\nEvery day, America's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart. One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: \"I will be with you again,\" he wrote to Gage. \"I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sandbox, watch you play sports, and see you have kids also. I love you, son. Take care of your mother. I am always with you. Daddy.\"\nOn Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is in the Gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well. To Kelli and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts forever. He is looking down on you now. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you both very much.\nThe terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris's life. Soleimani was the Iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of American servicemembers in Iraq. As the world's top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. He directed the December assault and went on to assault U.S. forces in Iraq. Was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard. And that's why, last month, at my direction, the U.S. military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever. Our message to the terrorists is clear: You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life.\nIn recent months, we have seen proud Iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons; stop spreading terror, death, and destruction; and start working for the good of its own people.\nBecause of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short-time recovery. It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let's see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.\nAs we defend American lives, we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East. In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are now underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies. These are warfighters that we have—the best in the world—and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home.\nWar places a heavy burden on our Nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and her two children, 6-year-old Elliana and 3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full-time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Amy's kids haven't seen their father's face in many months. Amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace, and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy.\nBut, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight, and we couldn't keep him waiting any longer.\nAudience members.U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\nThe President.Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much.\nAs the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. This is a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo—[applause]—the beautiful, beautiful Alamo.\nThe American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the Earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the Wild West; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers. And, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history, and we are making it greater than ever before.\nThis is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the New World, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of Almighty God.\nAmerica is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true.\nThis Nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American age, the American epic, the American adventure has only just begun.\nOur spirit is still young, the Sun is still rising, God's grace is still shining, and, my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-27"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in New Delhi, India", "Date": "2020-02-25", "Text": "Thank you very much. Please. So we had a couple of really great days in India. Prime Minister Modi is a terrific man. He's a terrific leader. And we have a lot of things going in terms of product being purchased by India.\nWe just had a meeting. A lot of the press was there. I thought it was a great meeting with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. They come from India. They're agreeing to invest billions and billions of dollars. You heard it for yourself. They're going to be investing billions of dollars in our country, so that was the purpose of the trip also.\nWe're all set for $3 billion worth of helicopters—the Apaches and various other types—in addition to other equipment; they're buying that. And they're buying a lot. They're going to be buying a lot, and they're also going to be buying a lot of our energy—all forms of our energy—because they need energy, and we have more than anybody. We're number one in the world now in energy. So that's going to be very exciting.\nBut I thought it was a great 2 days. It was a fantastic 2 days. I'm going to be not at all controversial, because I don't want to blow the 2 days, plus 2 days of travel, on one answer—one little answer. [Laughter] Little answer, like John [John Roberts, Fox News] will ask me one little simple question, and you'll blow it out, and that will be the end of the trip. They won't even talk about the trip. So I'll be very, very conservative of my answers, if you don't mind. [Laughter]\nBut we did—we had a great—we had a great time. We had a—great meetings. And we're going for a state dinner, and then after that, we get back onto the plane, and we go back home. It's going to be about 19 hours. But we look forward to it. Get in tomorrow.\nBut this was a—this is a tremendous country. It's 1.4 billion, probably, at least. The most people. And it's a tremendous market, and they really like us, and I think they like us more now than they've ever liked us, frankly. We have a terrific—a really great relationship between the Prime Minister and myself. So we're going to be doing a lot of things.\nI think it was really, really worth it. You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it, and the people that have it are—in all cases, I have not heard anything other. Maybe there's something new, because for 2 days, I haven't been seeing too much of that news, of very much news, because it's been very all-encompassing. We have—we've accomplished a lot here. We had a lot of meetings, as you know.\nBut the people are getting better. They're all getting better. We brought in some Americans from a ship, because it was really the right thing to do, and they're in quarantine. And we think they'll be in very good shape very, very soon.\nWe discussed a lot of different elements. We actually discussed the coronavirus. And at this moment, India doesn't have much of a problem, they feel. We certainly—it wasn't expressed that they did, which is great. And I think that whole situation will start working out. A lot of talent, a lot of brainpower is being put behind it. Two and a half billion dollars we're putting in.\nI see that Chuck Schumer criticized it. He thought it should be more. And if I gave more, he'd say it should be less. [Laughter] It's automatic, you know, with these characters. They're not—they're just not good for our country. If I gave more, he'd say, \"It should be less.\" But that's what they do. In the meantime, that's all they can do. They're not getting anything done. We have so many things we could get done. We could so easily do prescription drugs. You know, last year was the first year in 51 years where prescription drug prices went down. But we could drive them down really well if we had the Democrat votes. We need some additional votes. We would really drive them down, as you know.\nSo what—with that, I think what we'll do is take some questions, and we'll go to a nice state dinner, and then we go home.\nYes, John, go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, it's very obvious. I mean, I always thought that—frankly, that Justice Ginsburg should do it, because she went wild during the campaign when I was running. I don't know who she was for. Perhaps she was for Hillary Clinton, if you can believe it. But she said some things that were obviously very inappropriate. She later, sort of, apologized. I wouldn't say it was an apology, but she sort of apologized.\nAnd then, Justice Sotomayor said what she said yesterday; you know very well what she said yesterday. It was a big story. And I just don't know how they cannot recuse themselves for anything having to do with Trump or Trump-related. The right thing to do is that.\nNow, a Supreme Court Justice is a different standard, but at the same time, I think it's a higher standard, in a certain sense. So they'll have to decide what to do. But her statement was so inappropriate when you're a Justice of the Supreme Court. And it's almost what she's trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote. I just thought it was so inappropriate. Such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court Justice to——\nWell, you know what the statement was, John.\nNo, I don't think that was it. But I think what she did say is, she's trying to shame—the way I look at it: She's trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way. And that's so inappropriate.\nSo let's see what happens. We have things—whether or not they recuse themselves both. I mean, look, Justice Ginsburg, during my campaign—you know, I protested at the time. She apologized in a very minor form. And what Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was, really, highly inappropriate, and everybody agrees to that. Virtually everybody. I've seen—I've seen papers on it. People cannot believe that she said it.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\n2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Senator Bernard Sanders/Russia's Reported Interference in the 2020 Presidential ElectionQ.Thank you, Mr. President. The intelligence community believes that Russia is trying to meddle in the 2020 election. Do you agree with their assessment? And what is your message to Vladimir Putin about potentially interfering regardless of the candidate they support?\nWell, you know, what I'm reading—and again, I'm over here for the last number of days—but they went to see Bernie, and they told Bernie about something having to do with they want Bernie to win. They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that. And it was sort of a strange thing that they went to Bernie.\nAnd now I find out, if I believe what I read in some of your documents, in some of your papers, that it's a highly—it was highly exaggerated. And frankly, I think it's disgraceful. And I think it was leaks from the Intelligence Committee, the House version. And I think that they leaked it. I think probably Schiff leaked it, but some people within that. Schiff leaked it, in my opinion. And he shouldn't be leaking things like that. That's a terrible thing to do.\nBut basically, they would like to see—Bernie is probably winning, and it looks like he's winning. And he's got a head of steam, and they maybe don't want him, for obvious reasons. So they don't want him, so they put out a thing that Russia is backing him. This is what they do. I've gone through it for a long time. I get it. I get the game better than anybody. And that's the way it is.\nA terrible thing to say. And they didn't say it about me. I will say this: Somebody leaked it in intelligence, but nobody ever told me that. We have Ambassador O'Brien in the audience someplace, and he can tell you that this was never discussed with us.\nSo I think it's terrible. They ought to stop the leaking from the Intelligence Committee. And if they don't stop it, I can't imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what's happening.\nYes, please.\nGo ahead, ma'am.\nYes.\nWell, I think India would like to see it happen. I spoke with Prime Minister Modi today, and I think they would very much like to see them—see it happen.\nAnd we're pretty close. We'll see what's going on. We've got 2 days now under our belt without violence or, I guess, a minimum of violence. And we'll see what happens. But people want to see it.\nAnd it's very interesting, that one is. Everybody is happy about it. Even people that are normally against me, like 99.9 percent of the time—[laughter]—because we've been there for 19 years, and everybody would like to see it happen. I was actually surprised. I thought the Schumers of the world would say whatever the opposite is, you know, because that's all they can do. Cryin' Chuck. But people are really—they're really happy to see that we're trying very hard. You know, we're bringing it down to 86—8,600. And from there, we'll make a decision as to what the final outcome would be.\nBut there's been tremendous praise for the fact that we're doing something. You know, other administrations have tried to do something. In particular, the previous administration, for a long time, they were never able to get anything done. And we're really serving not as a military force as we are a police force. And we're not a police force. They have to police their own country. We're not a police force. It's like law enforcement. And that's the way it is.\nSo we'd like to, after 19—I can tell you, after 19 years, we'd like to bring our young people back home. Bring them—that's where they want to be. And we'll always have intelligence there; we'll have other things there. But we'd like to bring them—for the most part, we'd like to bring them back home. We want to watch the area. The area is a hotbed of problems.\nAnd when we bring them home, we'll let them know that if something happens, we will hit them so hard. And we could win that easily if I wanted to kill millions of people. I don't want to kill millions of people—innocent people. We could win that very easily. We don't have to act as a police force. We could act as a military force to win, not a military force to just take care of things in that very, very difficult part of the world. It's a very difficult part. It's a very dangerous part of the world.\nSo let's see what happens. So far, so good. So far. But I'm very impressed with the kind of kudos we're getting.\nYes, please.\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts/Burden-Sharing in the Middle East\nGood. Good.\nWell, I don't think anybody has done more than I have, if you look. Because I came in, and if you check your maps and look at Iraq and Syria, it was all over. In fact, they had it painted a certain color. I won't tell you what color, because it doesn't matter. Somebody will say it was a Republican color, so I don't want to get people confused. But it was; it happened to be red. [Laughter] And it was basically trying to show where ISIS was in those areas. And it was out of control.\nAnd I gave the orders, and we have a hundred percent of the caliphate. We have tens of thousands of people in prisons now. They're being guarded by the Kurds and others. Europe should take a lot of them back. So far, they haven't agreed to do that. They should do that because we did them a big favor. We captured them. But I did that.\nWe killed al-Baghdadi a few months ago. And Soleimani was—is gone. He's no longer putting roadside bombs all over the place. Somebody else may be, but he was the father—the king—of the roadside bomb. All of those young people that you see with missing legs and—missing legs and arms. I've seen every combination. The legs are gone. You go over to Walter Reed—I have to say, the doctors at Walter Reed are incredible, what they're able to do. Incredible.\nBut that's what his thing was. He thought that was a beautiful weapon: roadside bombs. It's a coward's bomb. And all of these young people that have been so badly hurt. And we did a big favor.\nIn addition to that, as you know, Hamza bin Laden is now gone. And he was looking to do damage. And he's gone. And Al Qaida, last week, you saw what happened there.\nSo nobody has done more than what I've done. And—but at the same time, Russia should do it. Iran should do it. Iraq should do it. Syria should do it. You know, we're in a different part of the world. We're doing it. Everybody says, \"You're the only ones that can do it.\" Well, at some point, these other countries—I mean, Iran should do it. Iran hates ISIS. And they should do it.\nAnd we've done a great job. We've taken our soldiers essentially out of Syria, except for little hotspots that we figured, you know, we'll do, that develop. But we've taken the oil. And the soldiers that we have there are the ones guarding the oil. We have the oil. So that's all we have there.\nAnd now we have—and if you look, we are down to a small force in Iraq. And we're down to a small force, very shortly—but right now, even, we have a small force in Afghanistan. And so we're moving out and moving around. But the only soldiers we have in terms of Syria, the predominant number of soldiers, are the ones guarding the oil.\nYes.\nYes. No, I agree. But you also have other countries that can do this. You know, the United States is 8,000 miles away. And they're all saying, \"Could you do it?\" Yes, we could do it. We've been doing it for a long time. But I've been doing it much better than anyone else has done it. I mean what we've done in the last couple of years has been incredible.\nWe have 100 percent of the caliphate. Remember, we had 99 percent. I'd say, \"Good, we're leaving.\" And I was hit with—people couldn't believe it. They said, \"Do 100.\" So we did 100. I did 100 with some great generals that knew exactly what they were doing. They were unbelievable.\nWe took a hundred percent of the caliphate. And we have thousands of prisoners right now locked up—and these are ISIS fighters—and killed thousands, not that I want to do that. I don't want to do that, but that's what we had to do. And when I came in, ISIS was all over the place. It was totally out of control.\nSo I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out, by the way? I'm trying to figure that out.\nHe was a person I didn't like, never liked. I don't know too much about the case because, as you know, I've been over here. Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven't been able to really see too much of it.\nBut I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit, not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like.\nI will say, the people that liked him were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats.\nAnd I guess my question is: Will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats. And you know, it's too bad, but that's the way it worked out.\nYes, Peter [Peter Alexander, NBC News].\nWell, again, I don't know the actual results. I haven't seen too much because I've been in India, as you know.\nBut I think—I think that from the standpoint of women, I think it was a great thing. It was a—it was a great victory and sends a very strong message—a very, very strong message, Peter.\nNo. No.\nThere's a big difference, in case you don't know, between Ebola and coronavirus. A big, big difference. It's like day and night. And I felt that we should bring them back. They're Americans. We should bring them back.\nWith Ebola, it was—it's very explosive. It's very terrible. We're making tremendous strides on Ebola with the things that we're doing, as you know. People are living——\n——let me answer the question.\nBut there's a tremendous—there's a vast difference than in bringing—especially in around '14. Was that '14 or '12? And at that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically—people would disintegrate. And we're still working on Ebola. We're doing——\n——we're doing the vaccine. Excuse.\nYes. We're doing a vaccine. We're doing a lot of things having to do with Ebola. We're not forgetting about Ebola. That's a horrible thing.\nBut we have that now very much under control, other than certain parts of the Congo where they're having war, and we can't get in. So we're still working on that.\nBut as far as the—as far as what we're doing with the new virus, I think that—I think that we're doing a great job. I felt that—and the decision was made in Japan—let these Americans come back, and we'll see where they are. But they were immediately put into quarantine. There's no problem with it whatsoever. They were all in quarantine.\nAnd, as you know, we approved—I approved $2½ billion for just that purpose and also for working on getting a vaccine.\nYes.\nI know, but the level of death with Ebola—you know, at the time, it was a virtual hundred percent—[inaudible].Q.But none of the Americans who came here?\nYou don't—there's a very good chance you're not going to die. It's just the—it's very much the opposite. You're talking about 1 or 2 percent, whereas in the other case, it was a virtual hundred percent.\nNow they have it; they have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we're very close to a vaccine.\nYes, please, go ahead. Go ahead, Peter.\nOh, all right. We'll—we'll—you'll get——\nGood. Thank you.\nYes, we're talking about the H–1Bs, and we are—look, the relationship we have—this is not from me, this is from almost everybody that saw it: They say in the history of India, which has a long history and a brilliant history in so many different ways, there's never been a reception given to somebody like was given—and I would like to say for the United States of America. But nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got.\nWe have been—we gave—it was 125,000, I think, seats they had yesterday. They were full. You had thousands and thousands of people outside. Prime Minister Modi was telling me thousands of people outside.\nThat's not uncommon for me, to be honest with you. But when I look at 125,000 seats—and that was an incredible scene yesterday. In addition, all of those people lined up from the airport to the event, it was an incredible thing. Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\nThe Ambassador just told me that he's been in India for a long time. He's never seen—in fact, both Ambassadors, our Ambassador and the Ambassador from India, said, in 40 years, he's never seen anything like it, what took place yesterday and, you know, earlier than that. But yesterday—they've never seen anything like it.\nSo it was a great compliment. It was a great compliment to our country. I'm the leader of the country, but it was a great compliment to our country. But Prime Minister Modi said today they've never, ever had any event like that. In fact, they said usually when somebody comes in, they have to look for people to fill up the areas. They said we had—there was something very special.\nLook, it's a massive country in terms of its population. And people just wanted to see. They wanted to pay their respect to the United States, and so I appreciate it. I was a recipient, in a sense, but I was just—I was just really representing the country.\nYes, Peter [Peter Baker, New York Times]. Go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nIntelligence Community Whistleblowers/Transcripts of the President's Telephone Conversations With President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of UkraineQ.Mr. President, your newly installed Personnel Director has begun talking with agencies about finding people in the Government that are not loyal to you and perhaps moving them on. How large a list do you imagined this will be? Is this a big problem in your mind? What—how do you—could you describe for us the scale of the problem as you see it?\nYes. Yes, I don't think it's a big problem. I don't think it's very many people. I think we had a whistleblower who was a fake. Because if you look at the whistleblower, as an example—if you look at his report, and then you compare that to the transcripts, it bore no relationship. So that was a very sad situation and a lot of time—a lot of time wasted.\nAlthough, as you will admit—in fact, you wrote very nicely, and I appreciate it—the poll numbers have gone up very much. But that's not appropriate to have—to benefit by something like that.\nThen, there was supposed to be a second whistleblower. As soon as I released the transcripts, the second whistleblower was gone. Nobody ever—what happened to the second whistleblower? I'll ask you, where is he? Remember the second was—he or she—the second whistleblower was going to happen. It was just a matter of moments. And then I released the real call—the transcripts, which are now 100-percent accurate, even according to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.\nSo no, we want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country, because that was a disgraceful situation.\nGood.\nRight.\nWe talked a lot about Pakistan. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan—very good. We talked about it today at length, actually, and—Prime Minister Modi. And it's no question it's a problem, but it's a problem they have—they're working on it.\nIndia is—you know, it's a brave nation too. There's no pullback from India. And we just hope—and I said I'll help. I'll do whatever I have to do, if I can do that, because my relationship with both gentlemen is so good.\nBut there has been difficulty in Pakistan, and we're seeing what we can do about it. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I would do.\nThey're working on Kashmir. Kashmir has been a thorn in a lot of people's sides for a long time. And there are two sides to every story, but they've been working on that very hard.\nWe discussed it at great length: terrorism. And I think we have some very good ideas. He's very, very strongly against terrorism. I'll tell you, Prime Minister Modi is a very—he's a very religious man, as you know, he's a very calm man, but he's actually a very, very strong person. Very tough, actually, when—I've seen him in action. And he's got that foremost on his mind, terrorism. He'll take care of it. Please.\nGo ahead. You. You. Right here. That's fine. Right there.\nYes.\nSo we talked about many things—many, many things. We talked about Iran. We talked about Iraq. We talked about—you know, we were together for 2 days. I'm going to be with Prime Minister Modi tonight for a state dinner at 7 o'clock. It starts at 7, I believe.\nAnd we talked about exactly all of the things that you're talking about. We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders. And I said, we have to stop that. We have to stop it, at least as it pertains to the United States. And I think we're understanding each other.\nWith China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent on $250 billion.\nBut in the meantime, we're working with China very much on the virus. We feel that's something. And I have to tell—I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is—he is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he's going to do well.\nNow you see it's going to South Korea, it's going to Italy, and it's going to other places. But I spoke to all of them. They're all working very, very hard on it.\nThe United States, because of an early decision I made—I made a decision. I believe it was the first time it's ever been done: We closed the country to certain areas, as you know. And I was criticized for that decision. Now they're saying it was a good decision.\nI think it was a good decision, because we have very few people. And you can add to it a few people that we took in because they're Americans. I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in between countries, where people weren't going to take them, and they're Americans. But they're fully quarantined. They call it \"fully quarantined.\" So you know, we did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country—these were wonderful people. It wasn't their fault.\nSo—but we're down to—we're really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now. But we've had a very strict line on the people that were taken—the areas from which we take. And I did it very early. It's never done before, and I did it early. So I think it was a good decision as it turned out. Yes, please.\nOkay, first of all, I want no help from any country. And I haven't been given help from any country.\nAnd if you see what CNN, your wonderful network, said—[laughter]—I guess they apologized, in a way, for—didn't they apologize for the fact that they said certain things that weren't true? Tell me, what was their apology yesterday? What did they say?\nYour record is—let me tell you about your record. Your record is so bad you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\n——in the history of broadcasting. [Laughter]\nAs far as Maguire is concerned, he's a terrific guy, but you know, on March 11, his time ended anyway. So his time came up. So we would have had to—by statute, we would have had to change him anyway. So the time was—[inaudible].\nI think—yes. Yes. In fact, we're talking to five different people right now. I think all people that you know, all people that you respect. And I'll make a decision probably over the next week to 2 weeks. We have some very good people.\nBut Joe Maguire is a very excellent guy. He's a very good man. And his time was March 11. I believe it was March 11 where he would have had to leave.\nNo. Not at all. Not at all. He was pushed out because, frankly—he wasn't pushed out. He would have had to get out. On March 11, he would have had to leave.\nBut we're going to be making a decision on DNI very shortly.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Please. Yes.Q.Mr. President——\nWell, that's not nice. Let her do it.\nYes. Let her do it.\nI know, but you ripped the mike out of her hand. You can't do that. [Laughter]\nBoy, that wasn't very nice. He's worse than you.\nIndia-U.S. Trade/China-U.S. Trade\nYes. We know. We know problems.\nYes. Sure. We know the problems. I know the problems. Previous administrations had no clue. They didn't know the problems. I know the problems. We're being charged large amounts of tariffs and—can't do that. You can't do that.\nAnd so they understand that that's where I am. And if they want to deal with us, and—and they will, they're going to, just like China. Everybody said, \"You'll never make a deal with China.\" I made a deal with China. It's a great deal. They're going to buy $250 billion worth of product. And that's only a piece of the deal. It's a large piece. It's probably 40 to 50 percent, but it's a—it's an incredible deal.\nIn addition to that, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars' worth of tariffs that we can now use for phase two, because they want to get rid of the 25 percent. So we have the 25 percent; they want to get rid of it.\nWell, with India—India is, I think, the highest—again, I said it before—but the highest tariff. When you deal with India, Harley Davidson has to pay tremendous tariffs when they send motorcycles in here. When India sends motorcycles into the U.S., there is virtually no tariff. For the most part, there is absolutely no tariff. So I just said that's unfair. And we're working it out. We're working it out.\nGo ahead.\nI think we'll win that one easily. We're working on that. Yes. We're working on that, John.\nNo, we're talking. We have—we have great discussions.\nLook, it's a—I can't lose this. I can't lose it. You know why? I'll never lose it. It's too easy—because I want reciprocal. It has to be reciprocal. And the money you're talking about is major. But the United States has to be treated fairly, and India understands that. The relationship is outstanding, but India understands that.\nWe've had a tremendous deficit for many, many years with India, with everybody. You know, with, frankly, so many different countries. We've had a massive, massive deficit. But a large deficit—$30 billion with India. It's now down to $24 billion because of what we've been doing. But still, that's too high. We shouldn't have a $24 billion deficit. With other countries, we have more than that.\nJapan, we're doing now—$40 billion is coming in. A lot of—a lot of very good deals are being made, and they'll be kicking in toward the end of the year. I would say if the deal happens with India, it will be toward the end of the year. And if it doesn't happen, we'll do something else that will be very satisfactory. It will be very good.\nGo ahead. Who else?\nNo. I didn't—no, excuse me, I didn't say——\nWait, wait, wait. I didn't say that. I didn't say anything about that. I just said Kashmir, obviously, there's a big problem between Pakistan and India. And I think they're going to work out their problem. But I will say, they've been doing it for a long time. [Inaudible]—problem for a long time.\nI don't want to discuss that. I want to leave that to India, and hopefully, they're going to make the right decision for the people. That's really up to India.\nGo ahead.The President's Visit to India/India-U.S. Relations\nWell first of all, I'd describe it as incredible, because when I looked at the various things—like today, when we went—you probably saw where we were. And when you look at all of the things that we've seen today, when we look at yesterday, the Taj Mahal and other things. In addition to working in between and even during, where, you know, we worked very long and hard with representatives from India and most particularly with the Prime Minister.\nI just think it's an incredible country. It's got unbelievable energy. You see that when you come in from the plane. When you see from—I think I can say, virtually, from the plane to whatever venue we were going to, it was wall-to-wall people. They've never seen anything like it.\nSomebody said it was the greatest greeting ever given to any head of state from any country. Now, India has more people than any other country, a little bit more than China. A little bit—tiny bit.\nI think the diplomacy is a diplomacy of great friendship and respect. And I think it's going to all work out very well. I really do.\nI admire your country tremendously. I respect your Prime Minister tremendously. And I think it's really a diplomacy of friendship, and I think it's going to work out very well. Okay? Okay?\nGo ahead, please. Please. Go ahead. Right next to Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters].\nSo I haven't really been given a full briefing on that. We're going to look at it. We will look at it. It's something that I don't like to see. I don't think it's fair, because we give very good access. Maybe some people would say we give too good. I don't think—I don't believe in that. I think we give very good access, so I don't think it's fair. But we'll have a decision made on that relatively soon. Okay? Thank you. Good question.\nPlease, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, you'll be seeing something on that in the not-too-distant future. Yes.\nThere could be very serious sanctions.Q.Against the Indian companies continuing to buy from Venezuela?\nWhat's happening in Venezuela is so, so sad. People are starving. Here's a case where a country was wealthy 15 years ago and very wealthy 20 years ago. Very, very wealthy. The wealthiest in all of Latin, South America. The wealthiest and—by far. Not even a contest.\nAnd when you look today, they don't have water, they don't have basic food, they have no medicine. It's incredible what's happened in Venezuela. No, we're watching Venezuela very closely. We don't like it. We don't like it. Not at all. Okay?\nYou're going to see in a little while. You're asking a question right in the middle of us doing something. [Laughter]\nGo ahead, please.\nReligious Freedom in India/Restrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S.\nWell, we did discuss that. And we discussed that and specifically Muslims. And we also discussed Christians. And we——\nI had a—I had a very powerful answer from the Prime Minister. We talked about religious liberty for a long period of time, in front of a lot of people. And I had a very, very powerful answer.\nAnd, as far as Muslims are concerned, as he told me, I guess they have 200 million Muslims in India. And a fairly short while ago, they had 14 million. And he said that they're working very closely with the Muslim community.\nYes. Yes.\nYes. I won the travel ban, as you probably know. A lot of people said I lost it. No, I won the travel ban, and we use the travel ban where we think there's—not based on religion, but where we think there's going to be trouble, where we're looking at certain countries. As you know, we added a few countries onto it.\nBut we won the travel ban, and we won it in the Supreme Court. So the travel ban is not a thing against Muslims, it's a thing against areas where we don't want people coming into our country that are going to cause problems, cause harm, cause death, hurt our people. And I feel very strongly about that.\nThank you.\nIndia-U.S. Relations/India's Economic Potential/Educational Exchanges With U.S.\nWell, I think that India is going to be a tremendous player over the next, you know—it's now, right?—but over the next period of 50 years and 100 years. Look, you're talking about the largest population in the world. You're talking about a tremendous country in terms of its heritage, its potential wealth, frankly.\nRight now they have—they have incredible potential. Economically, they have great potential. Their schooling system is getting better all the time. They're doing a fantastic job with—in certain sectors with respect to education. We see it. In the United States, we see it. We have a lot of Indian students coming to our schools. They're great students, and they've done fantastically well at our schools.\nBut we have, you know, thousands and thousands of people coming from India, coming to our colleges or particular schools, but our colleges in particular.\nNo, India has got a phenomenal future. I mean, you—you can rarely think of a place that has a better future than India and highly respected, especially with leadership like Prime Minister, right? Modi.\nYes. Go ahead. Pick one. Go ahead.\nSo I'm very satisfied because they're investing tremendous amounts of money. I met Mr. Patel a little while ago. He's the largest steel person in the world by far. I don't think there's even a contest. And he's going to be building a billion-dollar plant in Alabama.\nWe had the press—I left them in there. Always a risky thing to do. But if you—if you see the—let's say we ask—you know, answered 15 questions, and they were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now, in terms of their investment. They have done a fantastic job.\nThese are some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I'm not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they've done is incredible. But Mr. Patel, who's the biggest steel—I think biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual. But I think he's the biggest steel company by a lot. He's investing billions of dollars in the United States, and he's only doing it because of what I've done to bring back the steel industry. The steel industry was dead. Absolutely dead in the United States. And now it's a vibrant industry. It's incredible, and we need it. Again, we need it for defense. It's not just like certain industries that you don't need. We need it for defense.\nBut he was glowing. And one of the reasons he's spending a billion dollars in Alabama, and more money in other places in the United States, is because we brought it back. So we're very proud of that.\nSo I think what we'll do is we're going to see some of you on the plane on the way back. It's been an honor to be here. It's an incredible place with incredible leadership and an unbelievable future.\nAnd I just want to thank you all. And I'll see you back in the States. And I think some of you are on the plane, and we can talk a little bit on the plane too. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-new-delhi-india-3"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-02-26", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much.\nBefore I begin, I'd like to extend my deepest condolences to the victims and families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Earlier today a wicked murderer opened fire at a Molson Coors Brewing Company plant, taking the lives of five people. A number of people were wounded, some badly wounded.\nOur hearts break for them and their loved ones. We send our condolences. We'll be with them. And it's a terrible thing. A terrible thing. So our hearts go out to the people of Wisconsin and to the families. Thank you very much.\nI have just received another briefing from a great group of talented people on the virus that is going around to various parts of the world. We have, through some very good early decisions—decisions that were actually ridiculed at the beginning—we closed up our borders to flights coming in from certain areas, areas that were hit by the coronavirus and hit pretty hard. And we did it very early. A lot of people thought we shouldn't have done it that early, and we did, and it turned out to be a very good thing.\nAnd the number-one priority from our standpoint is the health and safety of the American people. And that's the way I viewed it when I made that decision. Because of all we've done, the risk to the American people remains very low. We have the greatest experts in the world—really, in the world, right here—people that are called upon by other countries when things like this happen.\nWe're ready to adapt, and we're ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads. As most of you know, the level that we've had in our country is very low, and those people are getting better, or we think that in almost all cases they're better, or getting. We have a total of 15. We took in some from Japan—you heard about that—because they're American citizens, and they're in quarantine. And they're getting better too.\nBut we felt we had an obligation to do that. It could have been as many as 42. And we found that we were—it was just an obligation we felt that we had. We could have left them, and that would have been very bad—very bad, I think—American people. And they're recovering.\nOf the 15 people—the \"original 15,\" as I call them—8 of them have returned to their homes, to stay in their homes until fully recovered, 1 is in the hospital, and 5 have fully recovered. And one is, we think, in pretty good shape, and it's in between hospital and going home. So we have a total of—but we have a total of 15 people, and they're in a process of recovering, with some already having fully recovered.\nWe started out by looking at certain things. And we've been working with the Hill very, very carefully, very strongly. And I think we have very good bipartisan spirit for money. We were asking for $2½ billion, and we think that's a lot, but the Democrats, and, I guess, Senator Schumer wants us to have much more than that. And normally, in life, I'd say: \"We'll take it. We'll take it.\" If they want to give more, we'll do more. We're going to spend whatever is appropriate. Hopefully, we're not going to have to spend so much, because we really think we've done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum. And again, we've had tremendous success—tremendous success—beyond what people would have thought.\nNow, at the same time, you do have some outbreaks in some countries. Italy and various countries are having some difficulty. China, you know about it, where it started. I spoke with President Xi. We had a great talk. He's working very hard, I have to say. He's working very, very hard. And if you can count on the reports coming out of China, that spread has gone down quite a bit. The infection seems to have gone down over the last 2 days. As opposed to getting larger, it's actually gotten smaller. In one instance where we think we can be—it's somewhat reliable, it seems to have gotten quite a bit smaller.\nWith respect to the money that's being negotiated, they can do whatever they want. I mean, again, we'll do the 2½. We're requesting 2½. Some Republicans would like us to get 4, and some Democrats would like us to get 8½. And we'll be satisfied whatever—whatever it is.\nWe're bringing in a specialist—a very highly regarded specialist—tomorrow, who works, actually, at the State Department. Very, very tremendously talented in doing this.\nI want you to understand something that shocked me when I saw it that—and I spoke with Dr. Fauci on this, and I was really amazed, and I think most people are amazed to hear it: The flu, in our country, kills from 25,000 people to 69,000 people a year. That was shocking to me.\nAnd, so far, if you look at what we have with the 15 people and they're recovering, one is pretty sick, but hopefully, will recover, but the others are in great shape. But think of that: 25,000 to 69,000. Over the last 10 years, we've lost 360,000. These are people that have died from the flu—from what we call the flu. \"Hey, did you get your flu shot?\" And that's something.\nNow, what we've done is, we've stopped non-U.S. citizens from coming into America from China. That was done very early on. We're screening people, and we have been, at a very high level—screening people coming into the country from infected areas.\nWe have in quarantine those infected and those at risk. We have a lot of great quarantine facilities. We're rapidly developing a vaccine, and they can speak to you—the professionals can speak to you about that. The vaccine is coming along well. And in speaking to the doctors, we think this is something that we can develop fairly rapidly, a vaccine for the future, and coordinate with the support of our partners. We have great relationships with all of the countries that we're talking about. Some—it's fairly large, a number of countries. Some it's one person, and many countries have no problem whatsoever. And we'll see what happens.\nBut we're very, very ready for this, for anything, whether it's going to be a breakout of larger proportions or whether or not we're—you know, we're at that very low level, and we want to keep it that way.\nSo we're at the low level. As they get better, we take them off the list, so that we're going to be pretty soon at only five people. And we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time. So we've had very good luck.\nThe Johns Hopkins, I guess—is a highly respected, great place—they did a study, comprehensive: \"The Countries Best and Worst Prepared for an Epidemic.\" And the United States is now—we're rated number one. We're rated number one for being prepared. This is a list of different countries.\n[At this point, the President displayed a piece of paper with a chart on it.]\nI don't want to get in your way, especially since you do such a good job. This is a list of the different countries. The United States is rated number-one most prepared. United Kingdom, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, Thailand, Sweden, Denmark, South Korea, Finland. These—this is a list of the best rated countries in the world by Johns Hopkins.\nWe're doing something else that's important to me, because he's been terrific in many ways, but he's also very good on health care. And we really followed him very closely—a lot of States do—when Mike was Governor—Mike Pence—of Indiana. They've established great health care. They have a great system there. It's a system that a lot of the other States have really looked to and changed their systems. They wanted to base it on the Indiana system. It's very good. And I think—and he's, really, very expert at the field.\nAnd what I've done is I'm going to be announcing, exactly right now, that I'm going to be putting our Vice President, Mike Pence, in charge. And Mike will be working with the professionals, doctors, and everybody else that's working. The team is brilliant. I spent a lot of time with the team over the last couple of weeks, but they're totally brilliant, and we're doing really well. And Mike is going to be in charge, and Mike will report back to me. But he's got a certain talent for this.\nAnd I'm going to ask Mike Pence to say a few words. Please. Thank you. Mike.\nDoctor, please.\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci.I just want to give you a very quick update on the——\nOkay. Thank you. Go ahead, please. Go ahead.\nIt's a great country. A long trip.\nIt's true.\nThey will.\nYes, we won't talk too much about that, other than I just got back. Long flight. It's a long flight. He's a great gentleman, a great leader. It's an incredible country. We were treated very, very well, and we really enjoyed it.\nA lot of tremendous progress was made in terms of relationship. Our relationship with India is extraordinary right now. And we're going to be doing a lot of business with India. They're sending billions and billions of dollars now to the United States.\nBut we'd rather talk about this right now.\nWell, I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens, we're totally prepared. We have the best people in the world. You see that from the study. We have the best prepared people, the best people in the world.\nCongress is willing to give us much more than we're even asking for. That's nice for a change. [Laughter] But we are totally ready, willing, and able. It's a term that we use. It's \"ready, willing, and able.\" And we have—it's going to be very well under control.\nNow, it may get bigger, it may get a little bigger. It may not get bigger at all. We'll see what happens. But regardless of what happens, we are totally prepared.\nWell, just so you understand, you know, I'm the President of the United States. I'm not the President of other countries. Other countries—some on the list that are very respected in what they do in terms of what we're talking about.\nBut I really want to be responsible for this country, if it means placing very strong—a very strong situation on the border so people can't come into our country from a country that is infected. That's—we're doing that, and we've already done it with numerous countries.\nBut we have to focus on this country. I don't think it's right to impose ourself on others. But if others aren't taking care or we think they're doing it incorrectly—you know, we're dealing with World Health, and we have terrific people. And CDC does go around and help other countries give them recommendations as what to do. But they're working on their countries and we're working on our countries. And so far, from our standpoint, it's really worked out very well.\nAt a right time, we may do that. Right now it's not the right time. But at a right time—and we are checking people as they come through, specifically for the problem, the problem that we're dealing with. So we're checking a lot of people if they're coming from—South Korea has been hit pretty hard; Italy has been hit pretty hard. China is obvious—what's happened in China.\nBut again, the numbers seem to be leveling off and going down in China, which is very good news. So we'll see what happens.\nWhite House Coronavirus Task Force/White House Messaging on Coronavirus/U.S. Cases of Coronavirus\nWell, Mike is not a czar. He's Vice President. He's in the administration. But I'm having everybody report to Mike. Mike has been very good, very adept. Anybody that knows anything about health care, they look at the Indiana model, and it's been a very great success. It's been a tremendous model in terms of health care. And this is really an offshoot of that.\nSo this isn't a czar. I don't view Mike as a czar. Mike is part of the administration. But I'm having them report to Mike. Mike will report to me.\nThey'll also be reporting, in some cases, to both. I'll be going to meetings quite a bit depending on what they want to do and what message we want to get out. But we've done, really, an extraordinary job. When you look at a country this size, with so many people pouring in—we're the number one in the world for people coming into a country, by far. And we have a total of 15 cases, many of which, or most—within a day, I will tell you most of whom are fully recovered. I think that's, really, a pretty impressive mark.\nNow, we did take in 40 people that were Americans, and they're also recovering. But we brought them in, so I call that—I have a different group. But we felt we had an obligation to American citizens outside of the country that were trying to get back in. We thought it was very important.\nYes.\nWell, I really think the stock market—of something I know a lot about—I think it took a hit maybe for two reasons. I think they look at the people that you watched debating last night, and they say, if there's even a possibility that can happen, I think it really takes a hit because of that. And it certainly took a hit because of this, and I understand that also, because of supply chains and various other things and people coming in.\nBut I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong. The consumer is the strongest it's ever been. Our consumers are incredible. They're incredible. That's why we're doing well, and other countries have not, even before the virus. We're doing great. Other countries have not been doing great. Our consumer is very, very strong and very powerful economically.\nYes, please.\nWe do have plans of a much—on a much larger scale, should we need that. We're working with States, we're working with virtually every State. And we do have plans on a larger scale if we need it. We don't think we're going to need it, but you know, you always have to be prepared.\nAnd, again, Congress is talking to us about funding, and we're getting far more than what we asked for. And I guess, the best thing to do is take it. We'll take it.\nWe'll we're going to see, but we'll take care of States, because States are working very hard. We have hospitals in states that make rooms available, and they—they're building quarantine areas—areas where you can keep people safely. We're working really well with States. It's a very big part of it.\nSo you know, my attitude: If Congress wants to give us the money so easy—it wasn't very easy for the wall, but we got that one done. If they want to give us the money, we'll take the money. We'll just do a good job with it.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, we can get a lot of it. In fact, we've ordered a lot of it just in case we need it. We may not need it; you understand that. But in case—we're looking at worst-case scenario. We're going to be set very quickly.\nBut we—I don't think we're going to ever be anywhere near that. I really don't believe that we're going to be anywhere near that. Our borders are very controlled. Our flights in from certain areas that we're talking about are very controlled. I don't think we'll ever be anywhere near that.\nPlease, go ahead.\nYes.\nSure.\nWell, hopefully, they're going to be able to do that. We think—we hope—that it's going to be in good shape by that time. But you know, they're going to have to remain a little bit flexible. Yes, I would say travel-related companies, certainly right now, that would be—they would be hurt. At the same time, this ends. This is going to end. Hopefully, it will be sooner rather than later. And I think the business that they lost will be picked up at a later date.\nBut you know, right now I think they're not going to be—probably not going to be going to China; they're not going to be going to certain countries where the problem is far greater than it is in the United States.\nWhat it's going to do is keep people home, and they're going to travel to places that we have. We have the greatest—it's the greatest tourism country in the world. So instead of leaving our country, leaving our shores, they'll stay here.\nAnd again, when you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.\nWell I think—yes, sure. Sure. I think Speaker Pelosi is incompetent. She lost the Congress once. I think she's going to lose it again. She lifted my poll numbers up 10 points. I never thought that I would see that so quickly and so easily.\nI'm leading everybody. We're doing great. I don't want to do it that way. It's almost unfair if you think about it. But I think she's incompetent, and I think she's not thinking about the country. And instead of making a statement like that, where I've been beating her routinely at everything—instead of making a statement like that, she should be saying we have to work together, because we have a big problem, potentially. And maybe it's going to be a very little problem. I hope that it's going to be a very little problem. But we have to work together.\nInstead, she wants to do that—same thing with Cryin' Chuck Schumer. He goes out, and he says: \"The President only asked for $2½ billion. He should have 8½.\" This is the first time I've ever been told that we should take more. Usually, it's we have to take less.\nAnd we should be working together. He shouldn't be making statements like that, because it's so bad for the country. And Nancy Pelosi—I mean, she should go back to her district and clean it up, because it's the number one—if you look at percentage down, that was one of the finest in the world, and now you look at what's happening.\nAnd I'm just saying, we should all be working together. She's trying to create a panic, and there's no reason to panic, because we have done so good. These professionals behind me and over here and over there and back here, and in some conference rooms—I just left a group of 45 people that are the most talented people in the world. Parts of the world are asking us, in a very nice way, can they partake and help them.\nSo Nancy Pelosi shouldn't—and she knows it's not true. She knows it—all they're trying to do is get a political advantage. This isn't about political advantage. We're all trying to do the right thing. They shouldn't be saying: \"This is terrible. President Trump isn't asking for enough money.\" How stupid a thing to say. If they want to give us more money, that's okay; we'll take more money. Some Republicans think we should have more money too. That's okay. We'll take more money. But they shouldn't demean the people that are on the stage, who are the finest in the world. They're not demeaning me. They're demeaning the greatest health care professionals in the world and people that do exactly what we're talking about.\nYes.\nWell, when they get the opinion totally wrong, as the New York Times did—and frankly, they've got a lot wrong over the last number of years. So we'll see how that—let that work its way through the courts.\nNo, no. If you read it, you'll see it's beyond an opinion. That's not an opinion. That's something much more than an opinion. They did a bad thing. And there'll be more coming. There'll be more coming.\nI hope so, because Shinzo Abe is a very good friend of mine. I love the people of Japan. And I hope it's going to be in good shape.\nAs you know, you have a number of people in Japan who have been infected. I hear they're doing a very professional job, which doesn't surprise me at all, with Shinzo and with all of the people you have. I know Japan very well. I think they're going to handle it very well.\nIt's a little tight, you know. It's a little tight. They spent billions of dollars building one of the most beautiful venues I've ever seen, and your Prime Minister is very proud of it. I hope it's going to be fine. We hope it will.\nRight.\nI would think so, yes. I mean, I haven't spoken specifically about that with the various doctors, but I would think so, yes. I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don't think it's going to come to that, especially with the fact that we're going down, not up. We're going very substantially down, not up.\nBut yes, I think schools should be preparing and, you know, get ready just in case. The words are \"just in case.\" We don't think we're going to be there. We don't think we're going to be anywhere close. And again, if you look at some countries, they are coming down. It's starting to go in the other direction.\nThis will end. This will end. You look at flu season. I said, \"26,000 people\"? I've never heard of a number like that. Twenty-six thousand people going up to sixty-nine thousand people, Doctor, you told me before. Sixty-nine thousand people die every year—from 26 [26,000;White House correction.] to 69 [69,000;White House correction.]—every year from the flu. Now, think of that. It's incredible.\nSo far, the results of all of this that everybody is reading about—and part of the thing is, you want to keep it the way it is. You don't want to see panic, because there's no reason to be panicked about.\nBut when I mentioned the flu, I said—actually, I asked the various doctors. I said, \"Is this just like flu?\" Because people die from the flu. And this is very unusual. And it is a little bit different, but in some ways it's easier and in some ways it's a little bit tougher.\nBut we have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job.\nGo ahead.\nThat's right.\nI think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves. And they say, \"If we ever have a President like this\"—and there's always a possibility. It's an election. You know, who knows what happens, right? I think we're going to win. I think we're going to win by a lot.\nBut when they look at the statements made by the people standing behind those podiums, I think that has a huge effect, yes.\nOh, I think it did. I think it did. But I think you can add quite a bit of sell-off to what they're seeing. Because they're seeing the potential. You know, again, I think we're going to win. I feel very confident of it. We've done everything and much more than I said we were going to do.\nYou look at what we've done. What we've done is incredible, with the tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military, taking care of vets and getting them choice and accountability. All of the things we've done—protecting our Second Amendment. I mean, they view that—the Second Amendment, they're going to destroy the Second Amendment.\nWhen people look at that, they say, \"This is not good.\" So you add that in. I really believe that's a factor. But no, this is—what we're talking about is the virus. That's what we're talking about. But I do believe that's—I do believe—in terms of CNBC and in terms of Fox Business, I do believe that that's a factor. Yes. And I think after I win the election, I think the stock market is going to boom like it's never boomed before—just like it did, by the way, after I won the last election. The stock market, the day after, went up like a rocket ship.\nWhen we're at a point where we don't have a problem. You know, we're not going to loosen the travel restrictions. That's what saved us. Had I not made—Mike alluded to it—had I not made a decision very early on not to take people from a certain area, we wouldn't be talking this way. We'd be talking about many more people would have been infected.\nI took a lot of heat. I mean, some people called me racist because I made a decision so early. And we had never done that as a country before, let alone early. So it was a, you know, bold decision. It turned out to be a good decision. But I was criticized by the Democrats. They called me a racist because I made that decision, if you can believe that one.\nWe have to all work together. We can't say bad things and especially when we have the best team anywhere in the world. And we really gave it an early start. We gave it a very early start.\nTrue.\nNo, because we can get money, and we can increase staff. We know all the people. We know all the good people. It's a question I asked the doctors before. Some of the people we cut, they haven't been used for many, many years. And if we have a need, we can get them very quickly.\nAnd rather than spending the money—and I'm a business person—I don't like having thousands of people around when you don't need them. When we need them, we can get them back very quickly. For instance, we're bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this, you know, great Government that we have, and very specifically for this.\nWe can build up very, very quickly. And we've already done that. I mean, we really have built up. We have a great staff. And using Mike, I'm doing that because he's in the administration and he's very good at doing what he does, and doing as it relates to this.\nYes, go ahead.\nI picked him, but you're fine.\nWell, we're testing everybody that we need to test. And we're finding very little problem. Very little problem.\nNow, you treat this like a flu. We were—in fact, I might ask one of the doctors to come up and explain it. You want to wash your hands a lot. You want to stay—if you're not feeling well, if you feel you have a flu, stay inside, sort of quarantine yourself. Don't go outside.\nBut there are certain steps that you can take that won't even be necessary. You know, in many cases, when you catch this, it's very light; you don't even know there's a problem. Sometimes, they just get the sniffles; sometimes, they just get something where they're not feeling quite right. And sometimes, they feel really bad.\nBut that's a little bit like the flu. It's a little like the regular flu that we have flu shots for. And we'll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner.\nYes, go ahead.\nNo, we're going to have tremendously low unemployment. We're setting records on that one. In fact, the administration has the—as you know, the lowest average unemployment of any administration in history. Our numbers are very low, very good—3.5, 3.6. But you can't really see what this does in terms of GDP.\nIt could affect it, but that's irrelevant compared to what we're talking about. We want to make sure it's safe. Safety, number one.\nBut this would have, you know, an impact on GDP. But we're still very, very—we're doing great. But this will—just like—I'll tell you what has a big impact: Boeing has a big impact. How did that happen? A year ago, all of a sudden, that happened. I think that took away a half a point to a point, even. You know, it's a massive company. I think Boeing—we had the General Motors strike; that was a big impact on GDP.\nAnd of course, we're paying interest rates. I disagree with the head of the Fed. I'm not happy with what that is, because he's kept interest rates. President Obama didn't have near the numbers. And yet, if you look at what happened, he was paying zero. We're paying interest. Now, it's more conservative. And frankly, people that put their money away are now getting a return on their money as opposed to not getting anything.\nBut I think, you know, we're the greatest of them all. We should be paying the lowest interest rates. And when Germany and other countries are paying negative rates—meaning, they're literally getting paid when they put out money. I mean, they borrow money, and they get paid when it gets paid back. Who ever heard of this before? It's a first. But we don't do that.\nSo I totally disagree with our Fed. I think our Fed has made a terrible mistake, and it would have made a big difference, as good as we've done, even without the 2,000 points. And we started off at 16,000, and we'll be at 28,000 without. We were going to crack 30,000. We have had increases like nobody has seen before. But we're doing well. But we have to watch—we're doing well, anyway, in other words, even despite the 2,000 points. It sounds like a lot, and it's a lot. But it's nothing—it's very little compared to what we've gone up.\nBut we'll be watching it very closely. But we have been hurt by General Motors. We've been hurt by Boeing. And we've hurt by—we've been hurt, in my opinion, very badly, by our own Federal Reserve, who has also created a very strong dollar. That's something nice about a strong dollar, but it makes it much harder to do business outside of this country.\nYou don't mean my supporters. You mean my people that are not supporters?\nYes, I agree with that. I do.\nI think they are. I think—and I'd like it to stop. I think people know that when Chuck Schumer gets upset—I mean, he did the same thing with a couple of trade deals that are phenomenal deals now—everybody has acknowledged they're phenomenal deals—before he ever saw the deal. He didn't even know we were going to make a deal. They said, \"What do you think of the deal with China?\" \"I don't like it. I don't like it.\"\nHe talked about tariffs. I left the tariffs on: 25 percent on $250 billion. He said, \"He took the tariffs off.\" He didn't even know the deal. And he was out there knocking it, because that's a natural thing to say. But when you're talking about especially something like this, we have to be on the same team. This is too important. We have to be on the same team.\nNo, I don't think the CDC is at all. No, they've been—they've been working really well together.\n[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nNo, they really are. They're professional. I think they're beyond that. They want this to go away. They want to do it with as little disruption, and they don't want to lose life. I see the way they're working. This general—these people behind me and others that are in the other room, they're incredible people. No, I don't see that at all.\nThank you very much. I appreciate that. I don't know who said that, but I appreciate it.\nNo, I think you have to always—look, I do it a lot anyway, as you've probably heard. Wash your hands, stay clean. [Laughter] You don't have to necessarily grab every handrail unless you have to. You know, you do certain things that you do when you have the flu.\nI mean, view this the same as the flu. When somebody sneezes—I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they're sneezing. [Laughter] I had a man come up to me a week ago. I hadn't seen him in a long time, and I said, \"How you doing?\" He said, \"Fine, fine.\" And he hugs me, kiss. I said, \"Are you well?\" He says, \"No.\" [Laughter] He said, \"I have the worst fever and the worst flu.\" And he's hugging and kissing me. So I said, \"Excuse me.\" I went, and I started washing my hands. [Laughter] So you have to do that.\nYou know, this is—I really think, Doctor, you ought to treat this like you treat the flu, right? And, you know, it's going to be—it's going to be fine.\nWait. I want to have—I loved—that was so nice of you to say \"thank you very much.\"\nGo ahead. Give me a nice question then. Don't ruin it. Don't ruin it with a bad question. Go ahead.\nThey listened to a lot of what I had to say. And they——\nThey listened to a lot. Well, because this is a much different problem than Ebola. Ebola, you disintegrated, especially at the beginning. They've made a lot of progress now on Ebola. But with Ebola—we were talking about it before—you disintegrated. If you got Ebola, that was it.\nThis one is different. Much different. This is a flu. This is like a flu. And this is a much different situation than Ebola.\nBut—and we're working on Ebola right now, by the way. We're working on certain areas of the Congo. The Congo has Ebola and caused largely by the fact that they have war and people can't get there. We can now treat Ebola. In that—at that time, it was infectious, and you couldn't treat it. Nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had ever heard of anything like this. So it's a much different situation.Q.Mr. President, the rate of mortality——\nYes, go ahead.\nOh, sure.\nI don't think I have. They've said it could be worse, and I've said it could be worse too.\nNo, I don't think it's inevitable. I don't think it's inevitable. I think that we're doing a really good job in terms of maintaining borders and turning—in terms of letting people in, in terms of checking people.\nAnd also, that's one of the reasons I'm here today: getting the word out so people can—they'll know. They're going to know.\nNo, I don't think it's—I don't think it's inevitable. I think that there's a chance that it could get worse. There's a chance it could get fairly substantially worse. But nothing is inevitable.\nThat's right. Brazil.\nYes.\nYes, we've gotten very strong on people coming in from Brazil. Now, it only has one case. It's a big country, but it only has one case. But still, it's a case.\nWe deal with Brazil very well. The President is a very good friend of mine. In fact, he ran on exactly—it's called \"Make Brazil Great Again.\" That's what he ran on. We get along very well. I know you're so thrilled to hear that. [Laughter] We get along very, very well, and we're working with Brazil. But we have much worse instances than Brazil. You know, you have Italy and you have other countries where they have much more than one person. They have one person right now. As of now—as of just a little while ago—one person in Brazil. But Italy is, you know, a deeper problem.\nAnd we're checking people coming in very, very strongly from those. And at some point, we may cut that off. You know, at some point, depending on what happens, we may cut certain additional countries off, like we've had to do with China. And we hope we can open it up to China as soon as possible.\nAnd we hope the numbers we've been getting—we hope the numbers that we've been getting are true on China, where it really has leveled off and started to go down, because eventually, sometime, that's going to happen.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nBecause—and I think Secretary Azar is doing a fantastic job, but he also has many other things. I mean, we're working on many, many things together. If you look at his schedule of what he's doing, including drug prices and—I think it's perhaps the most complicated job that we have in Government. And I want him to be able to focus on that.\nAnd Mike is really good at it. They're going to work together. They're going to work very closely together. And they're both in the administration. I see them all the time, so it really works. This isn't a czar. This isn't going out and getting somebody that's never been in the administration. I have two people that are very talented. And it's something I feel good about.\nI don't want to spare the horses. I have very talented people. I want to use them on this, because I want it to stay low or as low as possible.\nXi. President Xi.\nTook me awhile to figure that one out. [Laughter]\nWell, I can tell you this: I speak to him; I had a talk with him recently. And he is working so hard on this problem. He is working so hard. And they're very tough and very smart. And it's a significant group of very talented people that are working. And they're calling up Dr. Fauci. They're calling up our people. We're dealing with them. We're giving them certain advice. We actually have—through World Health, we have them over there also. And we have a lot of our people making up that group that went over there.\nNo, he's working very hard. It would be very easy for me to say, you know—it doesn't matter what I say, really. I can tell you, he is working—I had a long talk with him the other night. He is working really, really hard. He wants it to go away from China and go away fast, and he wants to get back to business as usual. So——\nCorrect.\nWell, we think. We think. We don't know exactly what it is.\nAnd the flu is higher than that. The flu is much higher than that.\nYes.\nIt may. It may.\nNo.\nNo, because we're ready for it. It is what it is. We're ready for it. We're really prepared. We have—as I said, we've had—we have the greatest people in the world. We're very ready for it. We hope it doesn't spread. There's a chance that it won't spread too, and there's a chance that it will, and then it's a question of at what level.\nSo far, we've done a great job. When you have 15 people, with this whole world coming into the United States, and the 15 people are either better or close to being better, that's pretty good.\nAll right, we'll do one more. Go ahead.\nIf you tell me that's happening, we will definitely investigate. We don't want that.\nAll right, one more. Go ahead. Go ahead.\nGo ahead. No. Yes. Go ahead.\nChina-U.S. Relations\nYes.\nWe're working with China. We just did the biggest trade deal in history. We did two of them. Between USMCA and the China deal, it's the biggest in history.\nThe relationship with China is a very good one. And I can tell you that, again, President Xi is working really hard. He wants this problem solved. As hard as you can work.\nThank you all. Thank you all. I'm going to leave you behind, and you can answer a few more questions. So you can ask them a few, okay?\nYes.\nYes, we'll do it. If you like it, we'll do it.\nWe'll do it. We'll do it more often.\nWish him good luck. In who?\nAbsolutely.\nOh, no, I have great confidence in him. Great confidence.Secretary Azar.I think—if I could just clarify, I think you're not getting the point here of this. I'm still Chairman of the Task Force. Mick Mulvaney has been serving, actually, an invaluable role for me as Acting Chief of Staff, helping to coordinate across the Government with my colleagues and the whole-of-Government approach.\nHaving the Vice President gives me the biggest stick one could have in the government on this whole-of-Government approach. So——\nHe's not. He's not being.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1266"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-02-29", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody.\nReconciliation Efforts in Afghanistan/U.S. Military Operations in Afghanistan/Negotiations With Taliban Leaders\nBefore we begin, I'd like to congratulate all those incredible people that have worked for so long on our endless war in Afghanistan, 19 years, going on 20 years.\nAnd there hasn't been a moment like this. We've had very successful negotiations. We think they'll be successful in the end. The other side is tired of war. Everybody is tired of war. That's been a particularly long and gruesome one. And I want to congratulate President Ghani and the people of Afghanistan.\nI want to remember all of the people—all of the great, great men and women—that have lost their lives in the war, and to their parents and wives and husbands and families, brothers and sisters: These are great, great people. Many lives, over such a long period of time, have been lost.\nI want to thank our wounded warriors, people that are still bearing pain and all of the problems that they've had to go through. And they're incredible people. Incredible spirit. I'd go to Walter Reed and see them so often. And the spirit they had—they wanted to go back. Despite their wounds, they always said, \"I want to go back.\" Wounded warriors, they're incredible people.\nI guess, most of all, I want to thank all of the people in the United States for having spent so much, in terms of blood, in terms of treasure and treasury—the money that has been spent, the lives that have been lost.\nAnd we just signed an agreement that puts us in a position to get it done, bring us down to in the vicinity of 8,000 troops. The United Nations was informed of everything. And NATO has been great. Secretary Stoltenberg has been fantastic. I want to thank the United Nations for the help they gave. And I also want to thank and congratulate Secretary Stoltenberg of NATO. Twenty-nine countries involved and all approving, all very happy with what's going on.\nI want to also thank and congratulate Secretary of State Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.\nAnd I'll be meeting personally with Taliban leaders in the not-too-distant future. And we'll be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they're going to be doing: They will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going.\nWe've had tremendous success in Afghanistan in the killing of terrorists, but it's time, after all these years, to go and to bring our people back home. We want to bring our people back home.\nAnd, again, it's been a long journey in Afghanistan in particular. It's been a very long journey. It's been a hard journey for everybody. We're, very largely, a law enforcement group. And that's not what our soldiers are all about. They're fighters. They're the greatest fighters in the world.\nAs you know, we've destroyed, in Syria and Iraq, 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate. One hundred percent. We have thousands of prisoners. We've killed ISIS fighters by the thousands—and, likewise, in Afghanistan. But now it's time for somebody else to do that work, and that will be the Taliban, and it could be surrounding countries. There are many countries that surround Afghanistan that can help. We're 8,000 miles away.\nSo we'll be bringing it down to 8,000, to approximately 8,600—in that vicinity—and then we'll make our final decision some point in the fairly near future. But this was a very spirited agreement. There was a lot of talk. There was a lot of everything. They've been trying to get this for many years. And just, it's time.\nSo I just want to thank everybody. I want to congratulate everybody. I really believe the Taliban wants to do something to show that we're not all wasting time. If bad things happen, we'll go back. I let the people know: We'll go back, and we'll go back so fast, and we'll go back with a force like nobody has ever seen. And I don't think that will be necessary. I hope it's not necessary.\nAnd so I just wanted to bring that up, before we begin, on a topic that has become very, very important to everybody.\nFirst of all, the amount of work that these professionals behind me and many other professionals in many rooms behind us who are watching right now—we don't have the room here to bring them all in—but they have been working around the clock, so hard, on the coronavirus. It's a tough one, but a lot of progress has been made.\nI want to provide an update to our people, to our citizens—to the world, frankly—on our action to address the coronavirus and those that have been hurt badly by it. At this moment, we have 22 patients in the United States currently that have coronavirus. Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late fifties. Four others are very ill. Thankfully, 15 are either recovered fully, or they're well on their way to recovery. And in all cases, they've been let go, and they're home.\nAdditional cases in the United States are likely, but healthy individuals should be able to fully recover. And we think that will be a statement that we can make with great surety now that we've gotten familiar with this problem. They should be able to recover should they contract the virus. So, healthy people, if you're healthy, you will probably go through a process, and you'll be fine.\nSince the early stages of the foreign outbreak, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in modern history to confront the spread of this disease. We moved very early. That was one of the decisions we made that really turned out to be a lifesaver, in a sense. A big lifesaver.\nOn January 31, I imposed travel restrictions on foreign nations who had—and anybody that had been to China or people coming out of China. And I want to say that China seems to be making tremendous progress. Their numbers are way down. And if you read, Tim Cook of Apple said that they are now in full operation again in China. Their numbers are way down.\nExperts now agree that the decision to move so quickly, despite a lot of opposition on that decision, was a wise one. It greatly slowed the spread of the virus to the United States, and it really gave us time to do some of the critical moves that we've done. And it allowed these great professionals to get together and figure it all out. And we think they've done that.\nWe've taken the most aggressive actions to confront the coronavirus. They are the most aggressive taken by any country. And we're the number-one travel destination anywhere in the world, yet we have far fewer cases of the disease than even countries with much less travel or a much smaller population. As an important part of our efforts, on Monday, I'll be meeting with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, actually. They'll be coming to the White House, and we're talking about a vaccine and developing, very quickly—and they've already started working on it—developing, very rapidly, a vaccine for the virus, to combat the virus. And we're having very good initial feedback. But the—these companies will be coming to the White House on Monday.\nTremendous amounts of supplies are already on hand. We have 43 million masks, which is far more than anyone would have assumed we could have had so quickly, and a lot more are coming.\nToday the White House Coronavirus Task Force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, they met for 2½ hours. I spent a lot of that time with them also, and we came up with some ideas, recommendations, and frankly, some pretty strict edicts that we're going to be going by. And Mike is going to be discussing that.\nBut we are really having a group of people that is so talented and they're working around the clock. And for that reason, I really would wish that we could really—that we could report exactly what's happened: how well we're doing under quite adverse circumstances.\nBut we're doing really well. Very, very professionally handled. Our country is prepared for any circumstance. We hope it's not going to be a major circumstance; it will be a smaller circumstance. But whatever the circumstance is, we're prepared.\nAnd I'd like to just ask and caution that the media—we would respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite a panic, because there's no reason to panic at all.\nThis is something that is being handled professionally. I also want to thank, by the way, Governors and representatives of our various States—in some cases, some more than others—because they've really been working very hard in areas where we've seen indication of the virus. But I want to thank the Governors and all of the representatives from all of our States. The rooms they've made available, the speed with which they've worked, has really been incredible.\nSo, again, thank you to everybody. I'm going to ask Mike Pence now to discuss a little bit about travel. And we have some restrictions on some travel from other countries that are having a hard time. And I want to thank everybody.\nAnd we'll take some questions as soon as we're finished. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nNo, no, no. \"Hoax\" referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody, because we've done such a good job. The hoax is on them, not—I'm not talking about what's happening here; I'm talking what they're doing. That's the hoax. That's just a continuation of the hoax, whether it's the impeachment hoax or the \"Russia, Russia, Russia\" hoax. This is what I'm talking about. Certainly not referring to this. How could anybody refer to this? This is very serious stuff.\nBut the way they refer to it—because these people have done such an incredible job, and I don't like it when they are criticizing these people. And that's the hoax. That's what I'm talking about.\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci/White House Messaging on Coronavirus Prevention Efforts\nBecause he has had that ability to do virtually whatever he's wanted to do. And in fact——\nHe was never muzzled.\nI think I can speak—you can speak. Why don't you speak to that?\nA very dishonest question, but that's okay.\nIt is dishonest.\nSteve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], go ahead.\nYes.\nWe are looking also at southern border. In fact, some of the folks are here right now. Ken is here someplace.\nAnd yes, we are thinking about southern border. We have received a lot of power on the southern border over the last couple of years from the courts. But we are looking at that very strongly.\nWell, I hope they don't change their routine. But maybe, Anthony, I'll let you—I'll let you answer that. Or Bob? Do you want to answer that? Please.\nGo ahead.\nWell, we care very much for the troops. We're in constant touch with the troops. We've been speaking to the general, as you probably know. Thirty-two thousand troops in South Korea. And that's all working out fine.\nAnd we're in touch—we were in touch with the authorities in South Korea too.\nYes.\nCoronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S./Foreign Travel Restrictions to the U.S.\nOkay, so, again, the \"hoax\" was used with respect to Democrats and what they were saying. It was a hoax, what they were saying. And that was very clear, if you'd read the words. And I think you know that too.\nAs far as what responsibility: My great responsibility—I think the biggest decision we made was going very early. And that was a decision made against a lot of people that thought we shouldn't do that. That's why we're at 22 instead of a much higher number. It would have been a much higher number. That was a big decision. It was a hard decision because it had never been done before anyway. I mean, not even early or late. It had never been made, a decision like that. So that was big.\nAnd my next thing is really getting the best people. We have the best people in the world. They're standing behind me. These people are so talented. I've seen them in action now for a number of weeks, actually, but for—in particular, for the last 4 or 5e days. And I want to thank Mike Pence and everybody for the job they're doing. We have a great team. We have great people. And this too will end.\nGo ahead. Please. Go.\nWell, I think so. I mean, we lead a life. I've—I get around. I was in South——\nI did.\nI was in South Carolina last night. We had a tremendous rally. I've been around. I think we're going to be in very good shape.\nYou know, you're talking about 22 people right now in this whole, very vast country. So I think we'll be in very good shape.\nYes. Please.\nRight.\nWell, he's a terrific man. He's been fantastic at everything he's done. He's highly respected. He wanted to wait until after the IG report came in, as you saw originally. I don't think he was officially or formally nominated. His name was thrown out. But he wanted to wait until after the IG report. The IG report has now come, and we've learned a lot of very bad things from the IG report, as you know very well.\nAnd I think he'll go through a process, and it will go fairly quickly. He's a very respected man, somebody that I've gotten that like; somebody who really has—he's someone who's really distinguished himself and, I think, over the last year and a half, 2 years, in particular. So we're very happy with that.\nAs far as the Taliban is concerned, everybody wanted this to happen. The Taliban wanted it to happen. President Ghani was very much involved in this, as you know. And he's now dealing with the Taliban.\nBut we're talking about 19 years we've been there. Nineteen years. And other Presidents have tried to do this. The Taliban has given a pledge—and a very strong pledge—and we'll see how that all works out. We hope it's going to work out very well. I think they have big incentives to do it, but they have to take care of the terrorists and kill the terrorists. We'll be working in a different kind of a fashion toward that end.\nBut the job we've done has been fantastic—a fantastic one in terms of terrorists and terrorism, and it's time for our people to start coming home.\nSome measures. We've been in very close contact with China, including myself with President Xi. He very much wanted this to happen. He wanted this to get out and finished and be done. He worked—he's been working very, very hard, I can tell you that. And they're making a lot of progress in China.\nYou probably saw Starbucks are now opened again. You probably saw that—as I mentioned, Tim just came out, and he said Apple is back to normal in terms of production in their facilities in China. They've made a lot of progress.\nWell, we have a great relationship, as you know, with Mexico. We have 27,000 soldiers—their soldiers—on our border doing a fantastic job. Our numbers are way down of people coming into our country illegally.\nWe have ports of entry that we are keeping open. And we're not talking about it; we're thinking about all borders. We have to think about that border. But right now that is not a border as it pertains to what we're talking about here. This is not a border that seems to be much of a problem right now. We hope we won't have to do that.\nYes, please go ahead.\nNo, no. You weren't—please.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Coronavirus Containment Efforts\nWell, I think our relationship with China is very good. We just did a big trade deal. We're starting on another trade deal with China, a very big one. And we've been working very closely. They've been talking to our people, we've been talking to their people, having to do with the virus.\nNo, our relationship with China is very good. Maybe it's closer because of what's happened here, because it was——\nYou know, in a certain way, this can bring the world closer, if you want to know. It can really do that.\nGo ahead.\nAfghanistan/Reconciliation Efforts/U.S. Involvement in the Middle East\nYes.\nYes.\nWe'll look at that. Look, nobody should be criticizing this deal after 19 years. He had his chance; he didn't do it. He was very much in favor of going in. We should have never gone in in the first place, when they went into——\n——when they went into Iraq.\nListen. Listen. When they went into Iraq, when they went into the Middle East in such a fashion, I was very much against it. Shouldn't have gone in. He thought we should have. That's been proven wrong.\nI'm surprised that anybody would be against something where we try and end a 19-year war. We're 8,000 miles away from our home. We've done a great job, in the sense that we've killed a lot of terrorists, we've put them out of commission. Who knows what they would have done if we didn't do that. But it's time for us to come home.\nNow, the Taliban, working with other nations perhaps—because you're surrounded by other very strong nations. And whether it's Pakistan or Iran or lots of other places, including Russia, they can all work on this. We've been doing it for nations that are surrounding Afghanistan. Now it's time for us to start coming home.\nAnd I think it's a very good situation. President Ghani is working on it very hard. We'll see how that works out. But the United States has done great services for people all over the world that, frankly, I don't think they've been given the, really—the kind of respect that they should be given for what we've done. What we have done for the world is incredible. And usually, we don't even get a \"thank you.\"\nIn Afghanistan, we did something. And I will tell you, for the most part—I noticed he was negative, but he should have tried to do something better. He was here for a year; he could have done something better. I was all ears, and he wasn't able to do that.\nThe deal has a chance to be extremely good. But what it does do is we start bringing our people back home.\nGo ahead.\nFederal Reserve System/National Economy/China-U.S. Relations\nGood. It's about time.\nNo, I think the Fed has a very important role and especially psychological. I mean, if you look at the—the Fed has a massive impact. Lots of it is psychological, and lots of it is fact.\nThis is something I think they should have done even beyond this and before this, because other countries—that are not as nearly as prime. We're the greatest in the world. It's our currency. Everything—we have everything. We should have the lowest interest rates. We don't have the lowest interest rates. Our Fed rate is higher.\nYou look at Germany. You look at Japan. You look at other countries. They have—many of them have negative rates. And we are not put in that position because of our Fed. And now we have this problem. You saw where Germany is lowering and also infusing a lot of money into their economy, a tremendous amount. I haven't heard our Fed say they should do this.\nOur Fed should start being a leader, not a follower. Our Fed has been a follower. We need a Fed that's going to be a leader. We should have at least the same rates and ideally lower rates than other countries. We shouldn't be paying more, but we're forced to pay more in interest. And we are the most prime.\nThink of it: biggest economy in the world, by far. China would have overtaken us in this year; they were expected to for 5 years—2019, they were going to overtake us. They're not even close, and they won't be close as long as somebody smart is right here, they won't be close. But I will say this: The relationship with them is good, but as far as the Fed is concerned, our Fed should be a leader. Our Fed has not been a leader at all.\nFrankly, we should have—we should have—we could refinance our debt at even lower rates. The rates are very low, but we should be refinancing debt at even lower rates. Our Fed is making us pay more than we should, and that's ridiculous.\nRight.\nI think this process will go very quickly.\nI think Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative—this process is going to go very quickly.\nAnd you know, that was—excuse me?\nYes. We can do that. You want to do that?\nOkay. Would you like to say something? All right. Okay.\nBy the way, the meeting with the pharmaceutical companies was actually set up before, over drug pricing, because we want prices to go way down. But it turns out to be a very convenient meeting as it pertains to the vaccine.\nTalk about both.\nWell, let me just respond quickly, and then I'm going to have Mike say something about that, because I've heard very good explanations, actually.\nWhen it came to health care, Indiana has been a leader, an absolute leader. And it was really started with others, but by Mike Pence, and he's done a phenomenal job on health care. One of the best, if not the best, in the country.\nAnd with that, I'll let Mike respond specifically, if you want to.\nIt was a great answer, and he's doing a great job.\nGo ahead. He's doing a great job. Great answer. Thank you.\nTurkey-U.S. Trade\nWhen was that? When?\nOkay.\nWe're speaking to President Erdogan a lot, and we are talking to him about exactly what you're referring to.\nThe market will all come back. The markets are very strong. The consumer is unbelievably strong. The companies are very strong. We have one problem. We have to get this problem brought into focus, and it is right now. I think our professionals are doing a great job. I'm not thinking—I'm not thinking in terms——\nWell, it's certainly—it's certainly not a good situation when you lose travel. That's a big part of market. But for a period of time, we're going to have to do whatever is necessary. Safety, health, number one. We—the markets will take care of themselves. The companies—companies are very powerful. Our consumer has never been in a better position than they are right now.\nLarry Kudlow was telling me before that the numbers—I said: \"Don't even bring it up. What difference?\" But that the numbers are very strong. He's got numbers from Friday, very strong. You see the numbers.\nBut our focus—our focus is on exactly this; it's not on that. That will take care of itself.\nGo ahead, please.\nCoronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S.\nYes.\nI think it's always good to be prepared. I think it's always good. But we are superprepared, when you hear 43 thousand—43 million masks, as an example.\nAll right, we'll do one more. Go ahead, the gentleman—go ahead.\nMultilateral Arms Control Negotiations/U.S. Nuclear Arsenal\nRight.\nThey all want to discuss arms control, and that's a wise thing. We're spending now over $20 billion on nuclear and on the superspeed missiles and many other things.\nAnd they have come to me, and they all want to now discuss arms control, and that includes China, and that includes Russia. And I think it's very smart of them to want to do it, and I think it's very smart of us to want to do it. And we will be discussing that in New York.\nGo ahead. One final question. Go ahead.\nNo, no. Please.\nLike, today. Okay? Today. They'll start immediately.\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be doing this quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of all of the facts.\nAnd again, I want to thank the professionals. They are great professionals. I've gotten to really know them and see them under very interesting and tough and trying conditions. We have the finest in the world.\nI will say this: Other countries call us and they ask, would it be possible for them to speak to Anthony and Bob and the people that you're talking to on a daily basis now. So we're going to be very transparent. We'll be meeting you probably tomorrow or the next day. We'll keep you abreast. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1267"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-03-13", "Text": "Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Thank you.\nA beautiful day in the Rose Garden. Appreciate everybody being here. Today I'd like to provide an update to the American people on several decisive new actions we're taking in our very vigilant effort to combat and ultimately defeat the coronavirus.\nThe—we've been working very hard on this. We've made tremendous progress. When you compare what we've done to other areas of the world, it's pretty incredible. A lot of that had to do with the early designation and the closing of the borders.\nAnd, as you know, Europe was just designated as the hotspot right now, and we closed that border a while ago. So that was lucky or through talent or through luck. Call it whatever you want. But through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus.\nI also announced Wednesday night, following the advice of our medical professionals who are doing a tremendous job—and we appreciate it very much—that we're suspending the entry of foreign nationals who have been to Europe in the last 14 days from entering the United States.\nCitizens, permanent residents, and our families—and even the families returning from Europe, will be subject to extra screening as well self-isolation for a period of 14 days.\nAs the World Health Organization confirmed today, many of the things that—what we said were 100-percent correct, including our designation, before them, of Europe. Like our earlier, very aggressive actions with China, this measure will save countless lives. I appreciate a number of the folks behind me. A lot—a number of the people behind me said that that saved a lot of lives, that early designation.\nBut it is only the beginning of what we're really doing, and now we're in a different phase.\nWe had some very old and obsolete rules that we had to live with. It worked under certain circumstances, but not under mass circumstances. They were there for a long time; they were in place for a long time. And we're breaking them down now. And they're very usable for certain instances, but not for this.\nTo unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50 billion of very importantly—very important and a large amount of money for States and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.\nIn furtherance of the order, I'm urging every State to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You're going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world. They're standing right behind me and to the side of me.\nI'm also asking every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also various engaged. I just spoke with Governor Cuomo; we had a very good conversation. And we're working very strongly with many States, including New York.\nThe emergency orders I am issuing today will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately waive provisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospital—all hospitals—and health care providers maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients.\nThis includes the following critical authorities: the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that's happened in the not-so-distant past. I tell you, what they've done with telehealth is incredible. It gives remote doctors' visits and hospital check-ins; the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services and States with the greatest need. Number two.\nThe ability to waive requirements that critical-access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours; the ability to waive the requirements of a 3-day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home. Big thing; the authority to waive rules that hinder hospitals' ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. They can do as they want. They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don't have any problem getting it done.\nThe authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital itself, ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established. We'll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they're entitled to. No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever.\nTen days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on a solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests. Other countries have called us and worked with us, and they're doing similar things or will be doing similar things.\nAs a result of that action, today we're announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly, and conveniently. But we don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn't be doing it. And we don't want everyone running out and taking. Only if you have certain symptoms.\nUsing Federal emergency authorities, the FDA approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We'll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night.\nI want to thank Roche—great company—for their incredible work. I'd also like to thank Thermo Fisher. The FDA's goal is to hopefully authorize their application within 24 hours—it will go very quickly; it's going very quickly—which will bring, additionally, 1.4 million tests on board next week and 5 million within a month. I doubt we'll need anywhere near that.\nAt the same time, we've been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive- through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car.\nI want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location.\nWe have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover the—this country in large part. So the world, by the way—we're not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country. Stores in virtually every location.\nGoogle has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They've made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this.\nAgain, we don't want everybody taking this test; it's totally unnecessary. And this will pass.\nThis will pass through, and we're going to be even stronger for it. We've learned a lot. A tremendous amount has been learned.\nI want to thank Deborah Birx, and I want to ask her maybe to come up and say a few words as to what's happening. Dr. Birx is a highly respected person. I've gotten to know her very well over the last 6 days. And what we've done is rebuild something that was very old, very old- fashioned, somewhat obsolete, certainly obsolete when it comes to the kind of numbers that we're talking about.\nThank you very much, Deborah. Great.\nI'd like to maybe have Tony—do you want to come up? You've become a—I think everybody out here knows you pretty well. But Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours. And you've seen a lot happen, but this has been—it's been a great experience, and working with you has been terrific.\nTony, please.\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci.Thank you very much, Mr. President. This is an example of—another example of what I've been referring to in my discussions with many of you in the audience as a proactive, leaning-forward, aggressive, trying to stay ahead of the curve.\nAnd what you're seeing now with this order is that we're going to be able to remove the constraints so that people at the State, the local level, the individual physician all the way up through the Federal Government will have as many constraints as possible removed for them to do everything they possibly can so that we can implement the things that we've been talking about—the containment, the mitigation—so that, as I've said many times, that curve that I referred to that goes up, we don't want to have that curve. We want to suppress it down to that small mound.\nAnd I think what we've done today is something that is going to be a very important element in having us be successful in doing that.\nWe still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we'll take care of that. And ultimately, as the President said, this will end. But what's going on here today is going to help it to end sooner than it would have.\nThank you.\nThank you very much, Tony.\nIf I could, some of these folks we know; they're celebrities in their own right. They're the biggest businesspeople, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world. And one of them is Doug McMillon from Walmart. And I'd like to have Doug, if you would, say a few words, wherever you may be.\nGood, Doug, please.\nThank you very much, Doug. Appreciate it very much.\nI'll just stay right over here. And, Richard, if you could come up, please. Richard, please.\nThank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Brian Cornell, Target. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Please.\nThank you very much. Great job.\nIs Tom here? Tom Polen. Tom? Tom Polen. Please.\nBD Chief Executive Officer and President Tom Polen.Thank you, Mr. President. As CEO of Becton Dickinson, we're one of the leading providers of medical devices as well as collection products for testing of coronavirus. We're ramping up our manufacturing capacity to ensure that the right collection devices and testing equipment are ready to address this issue. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThank you very much, Tom. Great job you've done.\nStephen Rusckowski, Quest Diagnostics. Please. Great job. Thank you very much.\nQuest Diagnostics Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President Stephen H. Rusckowski.Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. So, as mentioned, we were called, with the leadership of the Vice President, last week to come together as an industry. And we took advantage of that opportunity to work with the FDA, to work with the Center for Disease Control. And we are up and running with tests in a number of our facilities.\nAs the President mentioned, we now have capabilities from Roche diagnostics that we will bring into our facilities this weekend. And I know myself and also my colleague at LabCorp will be doing the same, so the capacity available to the American public to support this action with consumers will be considerably increased in the next few weeks.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThank you very much. I appreciate it.\nAnd Matt Sause, please, of Roche. Matt? Thank you, Matt.\nRoche Diagnostics President and Chief Executive Officer for North America Matthew Sause.Thank you, Mr. President. So, from Roche, we want to thank the FDA for their rapid approval of our coronavirus test. We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible, because it's critical for us to make that available to help patients in need, and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future, which will bring hundreds of thousands of tests available to patients in need in the United States. So thank you.\nAnd you can do it. You can do it. Great company. David Pierre of Signify—Signify Health. Please. Thanks, David.\nThank you very much. And we'll be changing a lot of the rules, regulations for future, should this happen in the future, which we hope it never does. But it will, I guess— somewhere out there. There's been some bad ones over the years, and I guess that will continue to an extent, but we hope it never happens. But we're going to be changing a lot of the old rules and specifications and regulations.\nAdam Schechter, who has really been of tremendous help. LabCorp. Please. Adam.\nLabCorp President and Chief Executive Officer Adam H. Schechter.Thank you, Mr. President. At LabCorp, we're working every second of every day to increase the number of tests that we can run. We're working with academic medical centers, with our colleagues at Quest, with other hospital and other laboratories to ensure that we do everything we can to increase the testing as we move forward.\nAnd I can tell you we understand how important the testing is, and we are committed to doing everything possible.\nThank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thomas Moriarty, CVS. We all know CVS. Thank you.\nCVS Executive Vice President, Chief Policy and External Affairs Officer, and General Counsel Thomas M. Moriarty.Thank you, sir.\nThank you, Thomas.\nThank you very much. Thank you, Thomas. Thanks. Great job.\nAnd Bruce Greenstein, LHC Group. Tremendously talented people. Thank you very much.\nLHC Group Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer Bruce D. Greenstein.Mr. President, thank you for the honor of being here. And the home health industry has been treating patients and seniors in the safety and comfort of their own home for decades. We're very proud to be part of the equation for testing in their own home. For Americans that can't get to a test site or live in rural areas far away from a retail establishment, we're here to help and to partner with our hospitals and physicians, as well as the people we have here today that will be doing testing around the country. Thank you.\nThank you very much. Fantastic.\n[Mr. Greenstein offered the President an elbow bump.]Mr. Greenstein.Oh, we'll practice that.\nOkay, I like that. [Laughter] That's good.\nTo help our students and their families, I've waived interest on all student loans held by Federal Government agencies, and that will be until further notice. That's a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed.\nBased on the price of oil, I've also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the U.S. Strategic Reserve. We're going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry and making us even further toward that wonderful goal—which we've achieved, which nobody thought was possible—of energy independence. It puts us in a position that's very strong, and we're buying it at the right price. And that's something that would have not even been possible a week ago. The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we're going to fill it up. This is a good time to fill it up.\nI'd like to ask Mike Pence to say a few words, please. VP.\nThank you, Mike. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much, Seema.\nAs I said in my address to the Nation the other night, all Americans have a role to play in defeating this virus. Our most effective weapon right now is to limit the damage to our people and our country and slow the spread of the virus itself. The choice we make, the precautions we put into place are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread and shortening the duration of the pandemic, which is what it is.\nThe CDC has published guidelines on the coronavirus.gov to enable—it's coronavirus.gov, and it's very heavily used right now, I will say—to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families, and their communities, while the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low. We've learned a lot about this over the last 2 weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions and those who are most at risk. They have not done very well. Older Americans who are—especially, if they have a health problem, they have not done well.\nWe must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and transmission of the disease.\nIt's incredible what's—sports—what's happening with the sporting world, where so many of the great sports that we've gotten so used to at this time of the year, they're not going to be meeting. And they've done a great service actually. But that would be another way that it could be—problems could be caused.\nBut this is why I outlined on Wednesday night my administration's—the fact that we've issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places, but in particular, nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to.\nWe need to be consistent in adopting measures to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same, whether it's spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar no matter where you go. No matter where you go. You have some hotspots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible, and they're being very seriously affected.\nKey among these efforts are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adopted by many companies, universities, and schools. And we want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we've issued by CDC and these commonsense measures. A lot of it is common sense.\nFor the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gatherings, postpone assemblies, social functions, and sporting events; stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren't canceled; limit in-person meetings; increase scheduled cleanings; and cancel work-sponsored travel—among numerous other steps that can be taken.\nAmericans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth, and in the coming weeks, we will all have to make changes and sacrifices, but these short-term sacrifices will produce long- term gain. And again, I've said we're learning a lot for the future and future problems like this, or worse. Or worse. It could get worse. The next 8 weeks are critical. We can learn—and we will turn a corner on this virus.\nSome of the doctors say it will wash through, it will flow through. In—interesting terms and very accurate. I think you're going to find in a number of weeks it's going to be a very accurate term. In times of hardship, the true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people, and we will get through this all together. We will just get through it. So much progress has already been made.\nAnd frankly, the numbers—because of steps that have been taken—are at a level that a lot of people are surprised, especially when you compare them with other places with far smaller populations.\nThe spirit and the will of our Nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America is tested, America rises to the occasion.\nAnd to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority, resource, and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people.\nSo we're with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis. As you know, we are rated number one in the world.\nWe're also helping other nations—many other nations; we're helping them a lot. And they're doing okay, in some cases. In some cases, they're not doing well at all. But we're working with a lot of groups of people and a lot of other nations.\nWith faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed. We will prevail.\nWe will be very, very successful. And we'll learn for the future.\nThank you all very much. If you have any questions, we can take some. Go ahead, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Please.\nAnd if you'd like to ask some of the folks up here, it would be fine. Please.\nWell, we just don't think they're giving enough. We don't think the Democrats are giving enough. We're negotiating. We thought we had something, but all of a sudden, they didn't agree to certain things that they agreed to. So we could have something, but we don't think they're giving enough. They're not doing what's right for the country.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes.\nYes, well, that's true. And we are looking at many different things, as you know. You know some of them—they've been written about very widely. But we're going to be releasing a paper in about 2 hours stating quite a few other steps, very important ones.\nPlease, go ahead.\nNo, we have no symptoms whatsoever. And we have—we had a great meeting with the President of Brazil, Bolsonaro. Great guy. Very—a very tremendous—he's done—he's doing a fantastic job for Brazil.\nAnd, as you know, he tested negative—meaning, nothing wrong—this morning. And we got that word too. Because we did have dinner with him; we were sitting next to each other for a long period of time.\nNo, we got—we have. We're talking about it, country to country, but we did discuss if he had a problem. It was reported that he may have it, and he doesn't, fortunately.\nYes, no, I don't take responsibility at all, because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time. It wasn't meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we're talking about. And what we've done is redesigned it very quickly with the help of the people behind me. And we're now in very, very strong shape.\nI think we'll be announcing, as I said, Sunday night, and this will start very quickly. And we'll have the ability to do in the millions over a very, very quick period of time. So no.\nAnd what we have done—and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future, in case something like this happens again. But it was a—and that's not the fault of anybody. And frankly, the old system worked very well for smaller numbers—much smaller numbers—but not for these kind of numbers.\nTony, maybe you'd like to say something?\nTony, please.\nAnd interestingly, if you go back—please—if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn't do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn't do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late.\nWhat we've done—and one of the reasons I think people are respecting what we've done: We've done it very early. We've gotten it very early. And we've also kept a lot of people out.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Please.\n——did with the swine flu. It was a disaster.\nNext, please. Next, please.\nThey had a very big failure with swine flu. A very big failure.\nRestrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S.\nYes.\nWell, that was recommended to me by a group of professionals, and we are looking at it based on the new numbers that are coming out. And we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will, you could say, ban—or whatever—it is during this period of time.\nBut yes, their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours, so we may be adding that, and we may be adding a couple of others. And we may, frankly, start thinking about taking some off.\nGo ahead.\nIt's true.\nI think it has been helpful. We've been working very much with China. I've spoken, as you know, with President Xi. They went through hell, and their numbers are starting to look very good. They're really looking very good. We're very happy about that. We are sharing data, yes. In fact, we're sharing quite a bit of data, including the fact that some of our pharmaceutical companies are working over there right now with large groups of people.\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nYes, I did.\nSo we didn't discuss the border. We've had a very good relationship. Just about finished with the USMCA, as you know. He called—actually, he called me to tell me that. I think that was the primary reason for the call.\nAt the time, his wife had not been diagnosed. And she's a lovely lady, wonderful lady, great lady. And since then, I've heard—read—that the result was that she has it. And I was a little surprised. I think he was surprised also. We did discuss it prior to. She's going to be fine, but he thought that she would not, most likely, have the virus. Unfortunately, she does.\nBut we didn't discuss the border yesterday, no. Go ahead, please.\nIf you have any questions for these great geniuses up here, you should—even a business question related to what we're talking about.\nCoronavirus Testing and Screening/National Economy/Coronavirus Prevention Efforts in the U.S.\nWell, I don't know that I had exposure, but I don't have any of the symptoms.\nAnd we do have a White House doctor and, I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. And I asked them that same question, and they said, \"You don't have any symptoms whatsoever.\" And we don't want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant.\nAs far as the cruise line business, we're with them all the way. It's a great business. It's a great U.S. business, frankly. And I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business, obviously, was hit very hard.\nWe had a tremendous success out in Oakland where we moved it. Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K. We worked with Canada. They took their people back. And Canada has approximately 600 people; U.K., likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom.\nAnd we have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really—you don't hear about it anymore. It worked out really well.\nMike, you may even want to say something about that because that was really done properly.\nGo ahead, please.\nAnd I might add that we're in the process—and, in some cases, have already done it—ordered a large number of respirators, just in case. We hope we don't need them, but we've ordered a large number.\nRight.\nWell, some are making progress; some are not, as you know. But some are making progress. And as they make progress, as they get down to the number that we all think is right—that they know is right, we know is right—we'll be opening it up. And some are really moving along rapidly. We hope to be able to open things up as quickly as possible.\nGo ahead, please. Go ahead.\nThat was good. [Laughter]\nRight. Better.\nBetter. Not 100 percent, but 90 percent.\nGo ahead.\nOkay. OAN, please. OAN.\nChina-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China\nNo, we have our deal with China. They're going to be buying $250 billion worth of goods and $50 billion from our farmers. And that's a great deal for our country; it's about time somebody did that. And frankly, phase two, we'll start negotiating.\nI did read one article, but I don't think that article was representative, certainly not of my conversations with President Xi. And they know where it came from. We all know where it came from.\nYes.\nWell, I just think it's a nasty question, because what we've done is—and Tony has said numerous times that we've saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. And when you say \"me,\" I didn't do it. We have a group of people I could——\nI could ask perhaps—my administration—but I could perhaps ask Tony about that, because I don't know anything about it. I mean, you say—you say we did that. I don't know anything about it.\nWe're spending—I don't know. It's the——\nIt's the—it's the administration. Perhaps they do that. You know, people let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. You know, things like that happen.\nOkay. Please go ahead.\nWe're doing a great job. Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and the—these great, incredible doctors and business people—the best in the world. And I can say that. Whether it's retailers or labs, or anything you want to say, these are the best of the world. We're doing a great job.\nWe have 40 people right now. Forty. Compare that with other countries that have many, many times that amount. And one of the reasons we have 40 and others have—and, again, that number is going up, just so you understand. And a number of cases, which are very small, relatively speaking—it's going up. But we've done a great job because we acted quickly. We acted early. And there's nothing we could have done that was better than closing our borders to highly infected areas.\nPlease, go ahead.\nYes, sure.\nI hope not long, but it's there now and it gives tremendous powers for things that we need. Tremendous power, actually. And the Stafford Act and various other things that we're involved with and have studied and memorized in so many different ways and forms, it gives the kind of power that we need to get rid of this virus.\nAnd we're going to do it very quickly. And I hope we won't need it very long, but whatever it takes.\nYes.\nSure.\nItaly is having a very—yes—we're in touch with Italy and, you know, it's a— it's a country that we love. We have tremendous—millions and millions of people, originally— origins from Italy. And we're working with them. They're in a very—they're in, probably, relatively speaking, the toughest position of all.\nWe're in touch with everybody. We're in touch with—when I say \"everybody,\" we're in touch with many of the countries that you know about, that you're writing about. And they're calling us asking for advice. They're asking for the advice of the people behind me.\nItaly has got a tough situation, but they're really—they have really clamped down, and I think they're going to see some very good results. It's tough. What they did—they really took their medicine, but they're going to see some much better results.\nYes, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].\nWell, I'll tell you, first of all, I'm not coming back from someplace.\nWe—and there was somebody that they say has it. I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures, and it lasts for, literally, seconds. I don't know the gentleman that we're talking about. I have no idea who he is. I haven't seen the picture. I said, \"There's a picture of somebody,\" but I take sometimes hundreds of pictures a day. And that night I was taking hundreds of pictures. So I just don't know.\nNow I did sit with the President for probably 2 hours, but he has tested negative. So that's good.\nPlease, go ahead.\nGo ahead, please.\nI would say, if you stay home, it's not bad. It's not bad. Now, there are certain parts of the country that are—essentially, you have no—have zero problem. Washington has been very tough—in particular, a nursing home. And, but Washington—the State of Washington has been very tough. It's been a big percentage of—when you talk about the 40 deaths, that's been has been a big percentage of the deaths, as you know very well. And they all came from a very certain area, unfortunately.\nPlease, go ahead.\nGo ahead. Okay.\nYes.\nRestrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S.\nWell, in light of the results, as we discussed before—in light of the results, we're going to be looking at it. And I know the Task Force is looking at it very strongly—Vice\nPresident, everybody. I mean, it was looking good, but they've—the results have been building up pretty rapidly. So we'll be taking another look at that. Yes, absolutely.\nGo ahead, please.\nI think they have to listen to their doctors, and I think they shouldn't be jumping to get the test unless it's necessary. But I think they have to listen to their doctors. And I mean, I don't know the—I haven't seen the picture. Somebody said there's a picture with somebody taking a picture with me, but I haven't seen it. But I can tell you——\nWell, I didn't say I wasn't going to be tested.\nMost likely, yes. Most likely.\nNot for that reason, but because I think I will do it any way. Fairly soon.\nWe're working on that. We're working out a schedule.\nYou go ahead, please.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nWell, that's been true for a while. But I'll let Mike—why don't you answer that, Mike, please?\nI think you have to remember though: We're working very closely with States, and there you have a smaller form and more targeted form of government going in and doing it—like, in New York, where the relationship is very good; like Gavin Newsom, where he made some very complimentary because—that's California—he made some really complimentary comments the other day about how we're working together. We worked on the ship together, but we worked on a lot of other things together, having to do with this.\nAnd we're—well, really, the relationship that we have—I can't think of a bad relationship. We're helping them. We're funding them, in some cases, depending on what it is you're talking about. And we're all working together very closely. So we've done, really, I think a tremendous job of teamwork with the different States.\nAll right. One or two more. And if you have questions for these folks—does anybody have a question for the folks up here? Who has a question up here? You have? Okay, go ahead. If you have a question, go ahead.\nOkay. I thought—I knew you would.\nI was waiting for that. Go ahead.\nAsk them first, please.\nWell, I didn't suggest that it could happen, but I can tell you it's an industry that was very badly impacted by what's going on with the virus. And it's a great industry. It's a very important industry, and we will be helping them. And we will be helping the airline industry, if we have to—assuming we have to.\nSo far, people haven't been asking. But if they should be asking, we'll—we want to make sure our airlines are very strong. And then, one day—and one day, all of a sudden, it wasn't looking so good.\nInterestingly, we were just talking—I was talking to Doug, and the numbers they're doing from the retailing standpoint—I guess, because of this, your business is like the opposite. All of you have done—you've been selling a lot of stuff. Do you want to answer the question, as to the hand sanitizers?\nPlease.\nAlex, please.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II.Well, just general preparedness. You know, you want to wash your hands. You want to keep distance from people. And if you're around someone sick, keep away from them. This is basic, basic public health.\nNo, these guys are selling a lot of toilet paper. I don't know, there seems—[laughter]—Tony, do you need to give some guidance that toilet paper is not an effective protection against getting the coronavirus? [Laughter] They're selling out. But the—soap and water. Hot water, soap, 20 seconds. That's how you do it.\nOkay. One more. Go ahead. Go ahead. No. Over here. Behind you. Behind you.\nThat's true. Thank you.\nNational Economy/The President's Recent Travel to India/China-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Vaccine Development\nWell, on small businesses, the Small Business Administration is now stacked with money to help them, and we're going to make the money readily available if they need it— small businesses.\nWe had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days, and he's a great friend of mine.\nAnd he's a friend of his people, because he was greeted incredibly warmly, as was I, in that stadium; that was an incredible event. And I loved being with him, so just say hello to him. But we—we talked about everything. We talked about far more than just borders.\nAnd as far as President Xi—likewise, he's a friend of mine. I believe that we are dealing in good faith. And we just worked to, as you know, and as I just said—we just worked an incredible deal. A big deal. One of the biggest deals ever made of any kind. Big even by the standards of some of the people here—the deal with China. But I think that they want to get to the bottom of things also.\nWe're working—our drug companies, our pharmaceutical companies are working very closely with China and with India, as you know, and with—all over the world. And they're all over the world. These are magnificent companies that are very, very knowledgeable.\nAnd it's—we're very lucky to have them, because I think you're going to come up with— whether it's therapeutic or whether it's just help—helping getting better. And then, ultimately, a vaccine, which takes a little bit longer because of the test periods and a couple of other reasons. You're going to have it very quickly because of the great knowledge. And they'll have it very quickly. They've made a tremendous amount of progress.\nThank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1239"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-04-14", "Text": "Thank you very much. Please. Very importantly, I'd like to begin by saying that we've just reached agreement—the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines—to participate in a payroll support program. This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy, and protect taxpayers. Our airlines are now in good shape, and they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them.\nThe United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness, we can see the rays of light. We see that tunnel. And at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We're starting to see it.\nMore than ever before, we've held our rate, the numbers, the—everything we've done. We've been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it. You look at what's happening in other countries—Spain, Italy, United Kingdom—we're working with them. We're trying to help them, especially with ventilators. They've been calling a lot. They need ventilators so badly.\nFifteen percent of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases. Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, \"Wow, that looks bad.\" But they don't have the problem.\nI salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing—even you people. It's so different looking out there when I look at you. Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives.\nAnd today I'm instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. Everybody knows what's going on there.\nAmerican taxpayers provide between $400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO. In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year and even less. As the organization's leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability.\nOne of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died.\nHad other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved. Instead, look at the rest of the world. Look at parts of Europe. Other nations and regions, who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. Many countries said, \"We're going to listen to the WHO,\" and they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe. Nobody can believe.\nThe decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO's attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures. Travel bans work for the same reason that quarantines work. Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission. Border control is fundamental to virus control.\nSince its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world and, most importantly, to help prevent global health crises. With the outbreak of the COVID–19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America's generosity has been put to the best use possible.\nThe reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain that and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it's not, to independently to tell the world the truth about what is happening.\nThe WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable. It's time, after all of these decades. The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese Government's official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019, which should have spurred the WHO to investigate and investigate immediately.\nThrough the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary. The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency caused valuable time, tremendous amounts of time. More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts in to examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done. The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples, to this date, has deprived the scientific community of essential data.\nNew data that emerges across the world on a daily basis points to the unreliability of the initial reports. And the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality.\nThe silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors and on new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID–19 in the country of origin is deeply concerning, especially when we put up, by far, the largest amount of money. Not even close.\nHad the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China's lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source, with very little death—very little death—and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage.\nInstead, the WHO willingly took China's assurances to face value, and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese Government, even praising China for its so- called transparency. I don't think so. The WHO pushed China's misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans. They told us, when we put on our travel ban—a very strong travel ban—there was no need to do it. \"Don't do it.\" They actually fought us. The WHO's reliance on China's disclosures likely caused a 20-fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that.\nThe WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many. America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions. If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals. We'll have no choice but to do that.\nOur countries are now experiencing—you look all over the world—tremendous death and economic devastation because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so. It would have been so easy to be truthful. And so much death has been caused by their mistakes.\nWe will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms. For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others. All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups, medically, politically, and every other way.\nAnd we'll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners: what do we do with all of that money that goes to WHO. And maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won't. But we'll be able to see.\nAs you know, in other countries hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators. But due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our health care workers, and the resilience of our health care system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator—with all of the talk you've heard, where some States wanted 40,000 ventilators. I said, \"That doesn't work,\" 40,000. And they ended up with 7- or 8,000, and they had no problem. Forty thousand ventilators for one State. It was ridiculous.\nThe scariest day of my life was about a month ago when, after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators; that we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators. This is the system we inherited. I had Governors requesting unreasonable sums that the Federal Government just didn't have.\nAnd you look at the States. The States didn't have—the States were not prepared. I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn't get one would die. And that's what we were told: They would die. I saw another country's doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn't. And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis. Those that didn't get ventilators were said to be in a position only of one alternative, and that was death. Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn't get them ventilators and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately? I instructed my team to move Heaven and Earth to make sure that this didn't happen.\nWe started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had. And I got daily updates on the supply we had from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates. We had a great group of people working on it.\nI instructed my team to use the Defense Production Act. And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully—more powerfully than anybody would know. In fact, so powerfully that, for the most part, we didn't have to officially take it out—it was a hammer; it was a very powerful hammer—in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible.\nLast year, America manufactured, from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators. And this year, the number will be over 150,000 ventilators. It could be as high as 200,000, far more than we'll ever need. So we'll be able to stockpile. We'll be able to talk to States about stockpiling.\nThese are high-quality ventilators. We had a choice: We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high-quality. We've done a high-quality ventilator.\nSo we should have anywhere from 150- to 200,000 ventilators. In addition to that, we have 10,000 ventilators right now in the Federal stockpile ready to move should we need them—we might not—should we need them in New York or New Jersey or in Louisiana or in Illinois or any other State that may need them if we have a surge.\nI'd like to ask Adam Boehler to come up and just say a few words. He's done a fantastic job, a young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation. And I'd just like to have— have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words.\nAdam, please. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Fantastic job.\nI'd shake his hand, but I'm not allowed to. Times have changed, haven't they?\nThank you very much. You did a fantastic job. We're very proud of you—you and your whole team. Thank you.\nToday we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available ventilators. This afternoon I met with the leaders—the top people—of many of America's big, powerful, beautiful, and you know, very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today. We had a great meeting, learned a lot. And they've been going through a lot and they've been doing a fantastic job, as everybody here will attest.\nI'm pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve so that we're going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we're able to help our States with at a later date if there's ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again. It was 1917, 1918. That's a long time ago. We hope it never happens again.\nAnd I'd like to ask Rick Pollack, CEO of American Hospital Association; Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare—that's the largest in the United States; Warner Thomas, CEO of Ochsner Health. And if I could, Mihal—you—are you here from Cleveland Clinic? Somebody? Good.\nThank you. Come on up, folks. Please.\nThank you. Say a few words please.\nAmerican Hospital Association Chief Executive Officer and President Richard J. Pollack.Thank you very much, Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve program. This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need.\n[Mr. Pollack continued his remarks, concluding as follows.]\nWe appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients. We'll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further. Your team has provided us with important leadership, and we look forward to working with you in making this a success.\nThank you, Mr. President.\nThank you very much.\nHCA Management Services, L.P., Chief Executive Officer Samuel N. Hazen.Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team. I stand here before you, in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country.\nOne of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID–19 battle was to find partnerships: partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and Federal. And we're proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership, and I think it's going to do great good for the community.\nSo thank you very much.\nGreat job. Thank you.\nOchsner Health Chief Executive Officer and President Warren L. Thomas.Thank you, Mr. President. It's great to have Ochsner Health be part of this program. We certainly have been a recipient, and the State of Louisiana has been a recipient, of help getting ventilators to our State and to Ochsner Health.\nWe're currently taking care of about 60 percent of the COVID patients in New Orleans, and we did see a spike over the past few weeks. But we're starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction.\nI also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health a couple weeks ago. We were running short on surgical gowns, and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us and other hospitals around the New Orleans area.\nSo we're excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, and we are proud to be part of that and help other communities around the country. Thank you.\nThank you very much.\nCleveland Clinic Chief Executive Officer and President Tomislav Mihaljevic.Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation here. On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a COVID pandemic.\nIn our home State of Ohio, with an early institution of social distancing, our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out the capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days. Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with COVID infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System.\nWe're also very grateful for the support from our State government, as well from our Federal Government. This is a battle where we're all in together. We coordinate our efforts, share our resources, and work together as one. I'm firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together. Thank you very much for having us.\nThank you very much. Great job.\nThank you all. Great job.\nThat was a terrific meeting. And thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is, compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain. Think of that—34.7, we have—and 6.6 the U.K. There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other health care facilities that are not in use at this moment. They didn't need them. We got a lot of them out, and they didn't need them. And that's a good thing that they didn't need them.\nBut a lot of good brainpower was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions. I want to thank our Vice President for the Task Force. And I want to thank all members of your Task Force on having done an incredible job. You really have done an incredible job. Thank you, Mike, very much.\nThrough this new partnership with the hospitals, unused ventilators will voluntarily lend them. Where they have unused ventilators, they will voluntarily lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need.\nWithin the last several days, more than 20 of our Nation's largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them. And I've been told that if they need more, there are more there. We're going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which is—which started, but will really start about less than a month.\nWe're going to be helping other countries, and they need it very badly. They have no chance without these ventilators. They have to have ventilators.\nAs we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients. It's the first one. These tests can be self-administered by patients in health care settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment. Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily.\nSo by using saliva—that's a first—they'll be able to do things, in terms of speed and ease, that we haven't been able to do before. So a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time. And that's innovation. I call it \"innovation under pressure.\" There's a big difference. \"Innovation under pressure.\" Right? Cleveland Clinic knows all about that.\nAs we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker. There's tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration's efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it's going to roar once it gets open. I think it's going to go up tremendously.\nYou see what's happening with the stock market already, because a lot of the very smart financial people—the great minds—they're looking at the stock, and they're saying, \"Wow.\" Because they really—what they're really seeing is how we're doing. If we weren't doing well, the market wouldn't be at a level that it is today. They have a lot of confidence that we're doing the right thing and that our country is going to be open soon and our country is going to be booming.\nWe've had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going. So I thank them for wanting to contribute. And we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders, seeking their input on how we can return to what was, until very recently, the greatest economy anywhere in the world and, I can say, the greatest economy in the history of the world. There's never been an economy like we had.\nJust a little bit more than a month ago, we set every record you could set: more people working than we've ever had working before—almost 160 million; the best unemployment numbers we've ever had; and the best employment numbers we've ever had. Everybody was doing well. Stock market at a record—142 days it hit a record. And I think we're going to top those records, okay? And I think we're going to top them soon, once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen.\nThe plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized, and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody. I will be speaking to all 50 Governors very shortly.\nAnd I will then be authorizing each individual Governor, of each individual State, to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their State at a time and in a manner as most appropriate.\nThe day will be very close because certain States, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other States. It's going to be very, very close, maybe even before the date of May 1. So that will be for some States. Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape. And we think we're going to be able to get them open fairly quickly, and then others will follow.\nThe Federal Government will be watching them very closely, and we'll be there to help.\nWe'll be there to help in many different ways, as we've been—where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody has ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Nobody can even believe.\nOther foreign countries—even powerful countries—can't believe what we were able to do with ventilators. Big, powerful countries. Big producing countries can't believe what we were able to do. We will hold the Governors accountable. But again, we're going to be working with them to make sure it works really well.\nNow, we have a list of people that I'll be speaking to over the next very short period of time—in many cases, tomorrow. We're going to have elected officials, and we'll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours. But we have a list of different industries that I'll be discussing by—meeting by telephone, because we don't want people traveling right now: the American Farm Bureau Federation—Zippy Duvall; Cisco Systems, Tyson Foods, Perdue Farms, Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Corteva, Tractor Supply Company, Seaboard Corporation, Grimmway Farms, Mountaire Farms, and others in the agricultural business.\nIn banking, it's: Bank of America—Brian Moynihan has been great; JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon; Goldman Sachs; Citigroup; Wells Fargo; U.S. Bancorp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman; Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bancorp—all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas.\nAnd if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible. And I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers. I hope they're able to get that done very quickly because it's been an incredible success, and many are already spending that money, and the money has been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time. It was only a week ago. But a lot of money has been distributed already. It's going to keep our small businesses open.\nThe construction labor workforce: International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey. These are a lot of friends of mine. The Laborers' International Union of North America, Terry O'Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel; Fluor; National Association of Homebuilders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AF of L–CIO; G.H. Palmer. So these are some of the unions, pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line.\nIn defense, we have: Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman. These are all the top of each company—CEOs, chairmans, presidents. Raytheon, General Dynamics. Energy—we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend. It finished with tremendous credit going to Russia and Saudi Arabia. And it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day are cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that's been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50 percent of the business. It's been an amazing achievement. Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made. Maybe the biggest oil deal ever made, they're saying. I didn't know that.\nBut we were involved in getting that done, and it was very important. We're going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry—Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy States. It's great. So we're very happy about it. I want to thank everybody. We had the—it's called OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC.\nAnd I also want to thank the President of Mexico because he was terrific. He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done. I want to thank him very much.\nOn the energy front, we had: Exxon Mobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan, Hess Corporation, Pearl Group, and a few others. Big ones. Great ones.\nFinancial services, we have: Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson & Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliott Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; MasterCard; Visa; Chubb; Sequoia; Stephens, Warren Stephens—great; Charles Schwab, Chuck Schwab, who will be here by phone.\nFood and beverage: National Restaurant Association; McDonald's; Darden Restaurants; Coca-Cola; Pepsi Cola; Chick-fil-A; Subway; Bloomin' Brands; Yum! Brands; Papa John's; Wendy's; Waffle House; Starbucks; Wolfgang Puck; Thomas Keller; Jean-Georges, my friend Jean-Georges; and Daniele. You know them.\nFrom the transportation world: FedEx, Fred Smith; Allegiant; United Airlines, Oscar Munoz; UPS, David Abney; J.B. Hunt; YRC Worldwide; Crowley Maritime—incredible, big, powerful shippers and transportation companies.\nIn telecommunications, we have: the legendary John Malone of Liberty Media; Verizon; T- Mobile; Charter Communications; and Brian Roberts of Comcast. Thank you all very much.\nHealth care: New York Presbyterian, Jerry Speyer—a friend of mine; HCA Healthcare, Sam Hazen. Thank you, Sam. Just met with Sam. Ascension Health, CommonSpirit Health, Community Health Systems, Trinity Health, Cardinal Health, McKesson, 3M. Thank you, Mike Roman, for helping us with face masks. It worked out well for everybody. Procter and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific— they've been helping us incredibly with testing. Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche—and Roche has been fantastic on testing, the job they've done. I have to call them out.\nThey have really—they have stepped up like very few. Anthem; United Health Group; Aetna; Cigna; and Humana—all the big ones.\nThe tech companies—we have the right ones: Apple, we have Tim Cook; Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar; Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz; Salesforce, Marc Benioff; SAP—SAP, Jen Morgan; Microsoft, Satya—great job he's done. Thank you, Satya. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg; IBM; Intel; Qualcomm; Cisco; Advanced Micro Devices; Broadcom. Incredible companies. Companies that no other country will catch, if they're smart. They have to be smart.\nBut I've dealt with a lot of different countries, and I will say that no—the respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies—there's nobody even close to our tech companies. They can't catch them. So they try and buy them, but we sort of put an end to a lot of that.\nIn sports—we want to get our sports back, so importantly. These will be some separate calls.\nSome will be together, by the way—lists—and some will be separate. But we have to get our sports back. I'm tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old. But I haven't actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter, and then I get back to work.\nThe NBA, Adam Silver; the Major League Baseball—we miss our baseball—well, this is baseball season right here. Rob Manfred, thank you very much. NFL—Roger Goodell. Thank you, Roger. UFC, Dana White. Great Dana White. PGA, Jay Monahan; LPGA, Michael Whan; USDA, Patrick Galbraith. Major League Soccer, Don Garber; WWE, the great Vince McMahon; NASCAR, Lesa Kennedy. Thank you, Lesa. NHL, Gary Bettman; from the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft; Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones; Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban.\nAnd some of the thought leaders that we're going to have—and there's some others that we are having; we're just waiting to hear. But everybody's saying yes, I must say. John Allison; Heritage Foundation, Kay Coles James—great person. Hoover Institute, Condoleezza Rice— another great person. Art Laffer; Steve Moore; Steve Forbes; Larry Lindsey; Catherine Reynolds; Scott Gottlieb—just spoke with Scott; Jim DeMint—and Jim has been a terrific friend; Bill Hagerty; and Ray Washburne.\nAnd religious leaders will be coming on Friday. We'll be speaking to—and we're going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders. We have incredible people, and they want to—they want to be a part. And we'll be talking about churches, and we'll be talking about opening. And we'll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me. We're going to find out how we're doing in that regard.\nSo those are the names that we have on our list. They're the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. And they're going to give us some ideas. But we're all set, as I said. The Governors are going to be opening up their States. They're going to declare when— they're going to know when. Some can open very, very shortly, if not almost immediately. We'll give a date. But the date is going to be in the very near future.\nSo we'll get it open. Individual Sates will—and the Governors will be held accountable. If they need things, we'll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing. We want them—because they're equipped to do testing. We've created incredible tests, and we've done more testing than anybody has ever done in the world right now. And we had a broken system, and now we have a great system. We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, \"We want to get some of those tests.\"\nI want to thank Abbott, because Abbott came up with the first simpler tests. The first one was rough. If you were—I think it was more of an operation than a test. [Laughter] The first one was—for anybody that took it, it was not easy. But now we have a very simple test with Abbott. Now we have saliva; we have lots of other things that are happening. But we have millions of tests.\nThe Governors are responsible. They have to take charge. They have to do a great job. And we're going to suggest that they check people, through tests or otherwise, coming into their States, and they run their States very strong. Eventually, we won't have to do that. Eventually, this will be gone. But for a while, we're going to do it. So they're going to take charge—at their borders, they're going to take charge of people coming in. And maybe, to an extent, depending on what they work out with their nearby State, it may be also people leaving. And they'll be able to do that very shortly.\nWe'll be announcing a date, but it will be very short. And frankly, it will be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed—the end of April. So we think that some of the Governors will be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that. We'll speak to them. But we're all set and we're counting on the Governors to do a great job.\nOthers are going to have to take a longer period of time until they're in a position to say, \"We're ready to go.\" And that's okay. We understand that. Some of the Governors have a very tough situation. But in almost all cases, it's all starting to come down. We're very proud of the job everybody has done.\nAnd if you look at the numbers—so the minimum, as you—as portrayed—Deborah is here.\nYes.\nWell, we're going to be dealing with countries, and we're going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world. We spend $500 million a year. We have for many years—more, far more, than anybody else, including China.\nAnd I mean, look, I read off a long list of problems that we have. And we've had problems with them for years. It doesn't matter—we're looking at a term of 60 to 90 days. We're doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak. But this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago. And when you look at the mistakes that were made—all of the mistakes that were made—it's just something we have to look at.\nAnd it is very China-centric. I told that to President Xi. I said, \"The World Health Organization is very China-centric.\" Meaning, whatever it is, China was always right. You can't do that. You can't do that. Not right. And we spend—and again, it's not a question of money. But when we're spending $500 million and China is spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million—$42 million, in a case. It's—again, not money, but it's not right.\nSo we'll see. This is an evaluation period. But in the meantime, we're putting a hold on all funds going to World Health. We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it. And that's another way of doing it, but we have not been treated properly.\nYes, please.\nYes.\nOn probably Thursday.\nAll right.\nI don't want to say that. They'll listen. They'll be fine. I think we're going to have a good relationship. They need the Federal Government not only for funding—and I'm not saying take it away—but they need it for advice. They'll need, maybe, equipment that we have. We have a tremendous stockpile that we're in the process of completing. We're in a very good position.\nAgain, the cupboard was bare when I got here. Nobody ever thought a thing—in all fairness to previous administrations, nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen, but it did happen.\nNo, the Governors will be very, very respectful of the Presidency. Again, this isn't me; this is the Presidency. The Presidency has such a great importance, in terms of what we're doing. And you can talk about Constitution, you can talk about federalism, you can talk about whatever you want, but the best way—I'm talking now from a managerial standpoint—is to let individual Governors run individual States and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them.\nYes, John [John Roberts, Fox News].\nWell, I don't know—look, I don't know.\nHey, John, I don't know what he said.\nNobody knows.\nThe individual Governors have testing. The individual Governors—we have many forms of testing, and new testing is being developed.\nOur country has to get open, and it will get open, and it will get open safely and, hopefully, quickly, some areas quicker than other areas. But there is tremendous testing and the Governors will use whatever testing is necessary. And if they're not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn't open. But they'll use whatever is testing—whatever testing is necessary.\nGo ahead. Please.\nWell, we're doing an investigation. I don't know the gentleman, but I know there have been problems. And it's been very unfair to the United States, just like the World Trade Organization has been very, very unfair, and now they're coming into line. When they consider China a developing nation, and because China is a developing nation, they take massive advantage of the United States? Why didn't other Presidents stop this? I've been talking about it from the day I got in, and we're looking at that very, very strongly. World Trade—W—so I have a problem with World Health and World Trade, both of them. I'm not sure which is worse, if you want to know the truth, but we'll figure it out. Okay?\nGo ahead, please.\nChina-U.S. Trade Agreement\nWell, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country. We're going to be watching very much to see. Now, it got a little bit waylaid by the virus.\nBut look, I'd love to have a good relationship with China. But if you look—and we made a phenomenal deal. China has paid—because of me, China has paid us tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time. Billions of—some of that money has been spent to farmers, where they were targeted by China. We cannot let that happen. We can't let that happen.\nSo we ended up signing a very good trade deal. Now, I want to see if China lives up to it. I know President Xi; I think he will live up to it. If he doesn't live up to it, that will be okay too, because we have very, very good alternatives.\nGo ahead.\nYes. Yes. Yes.\nExcuse me. Excuse me. I know—I know your question. You ready?\nThe Governors—the Governors are supposed to do testing. It's up to the Governors.\nGo ahead please.\nGo ahead please.\nQuiet.\nQuiet.\nQuiet.\nThe Governors are doing the testing. It's now not up—and it hasn't been up— to the Federal Government.\nGo ahead.\nI told them when they put this guy here, it's nothing but trouble. He's a showboat.\n——and you can have it out with the rest of these people.\nIf you keep talking, I'm going to leave, and you can have it out with them.\nJust a loudmouth. Go ahead.\nNo.\nNo.\nI'm not at all. No.\nThe Governors are going to be running their individual States. Some of them will say, \"No, I can't open now.\" And some of them may last longer than we even would think. Others will say, \"I can.\"\nYou can go—I don't want to mention States, but there are numerous States that are in great shape right now. They're viewing the rest of the country like we don't even believe this is happening. We have a lot of those States. They're set to open, practically, now. I mean, they would be open now. We're going to let them open sooner than the date. We're going to pick a date. We're going to get a date that's good. But it's going to be very, very soon, sooner than the end of the month.\nBut there are many States out there that are looking at this, and they're reviewing it, and they're saying, \"We shouldn't be even included in this.\" You know, there are some that want to open up almost now.\nNow, if we disagree with it, we're not going to let them open. We're not going to let them open. If some Governor said—you know, has a lot of problems, a lot of cases, a lot of death, and they want to open early, we're not going to let it happen. So we're there to watch. We're there to help. But we're also there to be critics.\nAnd on testing—very important—we've always wanted the States to do the testing. We're now providing great testing, but the State has to provide the great testing. The State has to provide the ventilators, but they didn't do that. So we ended up going into the ventilator business, essentially, and we made tens of thousands of ventilators and we solved a big problem for the States. But we want them to do the testing, and we are there to help.\nYes, please.\nChina-U.S. Trade/World Health Organization/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S.\nOne question. Just one.\nOne question. Go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nI'm always respectful of China.\nI'm respectful of other countries. Why wouldn't I be respectful of China? In the meantime, China has paid us nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration.\nThey paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we've done. And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases. Let's see if they do that. And they're also paying us 25 percent on $250 billion in tariffs. So we're taking in—wait a minute. We're taking in billions of dollars for China—from China. They never paid us 10 cents. That's a great thing.\nNow, if they don't produce, or if we find out bad things, we're not going to be happy. But right now—and we're doing that. That's what we're doing.\nLook, we have an investigation underway. We're paying almost $500 million. We have an investigation underway on the World Health Organization. We will find out exactly what went on. And we may be satisfied that it can be remedied, and we may be satisfied that it's so bad that it can't be remedied. And if it can't, we're going to go a different route.\nI don't talk about China's transparency.\nWell, you know, if I'm so good to China, how come I was the only person— the only leader of a country—that closed our borders tightly against China?\nAnd by the way, when I closed our border, that was long ahead of what anybody—you can ask anybody that was in the room. Twenty-one people. I was the one person that wanted to do it. Deborah can tell you that better than anybody. I was the one person that wanted to do it. You know why? Because I don't believe everything I hear, and I closed. And if we didn't close our border early, very early, long before the kind of dates you're talking about— we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more death.\nPlease. That's enough. Thank you.\nYes. That's being worked on very strongly.\nI would say within 2 weeks. And it's being worked on. Deborah, we're working on that very strongly.\nOkay, CDC is working, but we're getting reports on that. Yes, please, go ahead.\nNo, in the back. Yes.\nWe may not—but we may not.\nYou know, some countries have and some countries haven't. I'm watching other countries. I'm studying other countries as they open. I mean, I don't want to go into names because, for some, it would be a little bit embarrassing. But I'm studying other countries as we go along.\nSo, on that, we have looked at every country that's opened, some successfully, some okay. No total disaster, but some okay. And some have to go back to the hotspot and fix the hotspot. We think we're going to do it very successfully.\nAgain, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces. It's a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful States with capable Governors. They know when it's time to open.\nAnd we don't want to put pressure on anybody. I'm not going to put any pressure on any governor to open. I'm not going to say to Governor Cuomo, \"You've got to open within 7 days.\" I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York. I'm not putting any pressure on the Governors. Some of them don't need pressure or not pressure. I mean, they're ready to go.\nAnd that's a good thing.\nSo we'll open it up in beautiful, little pieces as it comes along. Please, go ahead. Behind you.\nYes, I mean, I've declared myself as king. You know, I heard he said that. But I didn't see the remarks. But he understands how we helped him.\nHe needed help. We gave him 2,900 hospital beds; he didn't use them. We gave him a ship; he didn't use them. And I'm not saying—but I'm saying that's good, because you know what? That means he didn't need them. But we said it was too much, but we wanted to err—we said, \"Err on the side of caution,\" as I said. We said, \"Look, we don't think you need it, but if you do, we're going to have them built.\"\nAnd the Army Corps of Engineers did a fantastic job. And the U.S. Navy did a fantastic job, when we moved a ship that was not meant for COVID, and we had it redesigned for COVID. But they still didn't have very many people going in.\nNo, we are—we'll get along just fine. He understands. We'll get along just fine. Please.\nTalk up, please. Louder.\nWell, that's going to be up to the Governors. The Governors are going to want to make sure everything is safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a, maybe, weekly basis; you don't have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They can do temperature gauges. They can do a lot of different things.\nAnd you know, we're only talking about for a period of time. You know, eventually, we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames, eventually. You know, we're not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were.\nI want people to understand that. We're not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to sit. Look at the—look at this, the way this looks. I don't even like the way it looks, although I have a lot fewer reporters; that's okay with me.\nBut look at the way this looks. I've never seen anything—John, I've never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people—we don't want this. I don't want this. I don't want this.\nEventually, we're going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats, because they can't make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to. I don't know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will.\nI said to some of the hospital people today, \"So will people be shaking hands again?\" And I must say, I was a little surprised most of them said, \"Probably,\" because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big hand shaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, \"I think I better start shaking people's hands.\"\nGo ahead, John.\nWell, we're trying to get it done. The problem is the Democrats want to put all sorts of things. Last time, they put Kennedy Center, and I hated putting Kennedy Center. And I've great respect for Kennedy Center, but I hated putting it in the bill because it's just not appropriate. Right?\nAnd—but they wanted it in for whatever reason. They had their own political reason. And, John, I said, \"Watch the way that blows up.\" And it blew up. I think it blew up in their face. We want to take care of our workers. We'll worry about other things and other pet projects of Democrats—and also Republicans—later.\nBut it's been a tremendously successful program. I think you see it. The banks have stepped up. Hundreds of thousands of loan applications approved. Money is going out. It's been a tremendous program. Really, it's been—and obviously, it was at a point where we're almost—you know, we're almost—the money will be expired, and we could use a refill for the workers. We want to be able to make sure that small businesses stay open, John. And I think that'll happen.\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nNo, I didn't say all of them by May 1, but there are 20 States—actually, I was given a number. Twenty-nine States are in very, very good shape. I don't want to say whether or not the Governor spoke with me about that, but we've had a very good relationship—Gavin Newsom. And—a very, very good relationship.\nYes, in the back. Go ahead, please.\nOne question.\nWho cares? If he can't be here, that's too bad, you know. Right?\nWell, I think our farmers are incredible. They're producing levels of food, like, just unbelievable. Our transportation—that's one of the reasons I have the transportation people on the line tomorrow for the delivery of the food. No, we're doing phenomenally with the food.\nAnd I will say, the stores Kroger and Walmart, which has a lot of the food and many of the stores, they seem to be in very good shape, but I haven't heard that at all. We're going to be very strong on food supply.\nOkay, how about one more question? Go ahead, please.\nYes.\nWell, I'm not easing up. First of all, we'll have guidelines, even for the States that open. And they'll be guidelines. But we will not have any problem with that.\nYour question is a very interesting question, but the States that are opening are not States which will have a problem with that. Plus, they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished.\nNo, the reason they don't have is—is partially, and some of that will stay in effect. Much of it will stay in effect for a period of time. But the reason, also, is that they're different kinds of States. They have lots of room. They have fewer people and they have lots of room, and that's one of the primary reasons.\nI want to thank you all very much. So a lot of positive things are happening. We're going to have some very strong recommendations for the Governors. We're going to work with the Governors. The Governors are going to do a good job. And if they don't do a good job, we're going to come down on them very hard. We'll have no other choice.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1240"}
{"Title": "Interview with David Muir of ABC News' \"World News Tonight\"", "Date": "2020-05-06", "Text": "It's too bad, actually. Too bad.\nThank you very much.\nThank you, David.\nYes.\nWell, I think actually the decision to close the country was the biggest decision I've ever had to make, and I've said that very loud and clear. I mean, we had the greatest economy in history, in the history of the world, not only our economy, it was our greatest economy. Best employment numbers, best numbers in every single way. And they said, sir, we have to close the country.\nI said, What are you talking about? Close the country? Because nobody's ever heard of such a thing. And we saved millions of lives by doing it and by putting the ban on China very early, it was a big thing.\nBut the biggest decision I've ever had to make is closing the country, and certainly this is now also a big decision but the people want to go back to work. We have to get our country back and we're going to have an economy in the not too distant future that will be equal to and I hope even greater In a short period of time.\nSure.\nIt's possible there will be some because you won't be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is, but at the same time, we're going to practice social distancing, we're going to be washing hands, we're going to be doing a lot of the things that we've learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back. You know, people are dying the other way too. When you look at what's happened with drugs. It goes up, when you look at suicides, I mean take a look at what's going on. People are losing their jobs. We have to bring it back and that's what we're doing.\nAgain, we're going to do it safely. And not in all cases but most of the governors are working very much with us on this. We've had a very good relationship pretty much with all the governors because we've produced like nobody's ever produced before. What we've done with ventilators, and by the way testing which has been a tremendous success, even though we don't get the proper treatment on it but you take a look at what we've done with supplies and gloves. Millions and millions of gloves. I think they have 1 billion pair. Nobody's ever done -- this is the biggest mobilization since World War Two and it's -- it's been incredible.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nNo, they don't. They have to test if they want. You know, some people are strong believers in testing. I just got this just literally as I was getting off the plane. This just came out. This Is us, testing, this is testing. This is Germany that everybody has been saying has done such a good job and they have and I've told that to Angela, but she tells me the same thing. She said \"How did you ever do this?\" South Korea is here. Look at this, one is India. Take a look at these numbers.\nThis is the United States. We've done more testing than any other country, by far, and again -- just came out. I don't even know who the people are that did it -- just came out. It's also, very importantly, we have the best testing. We have the best testing.\nThey should have no problem.\nThey should have no problem. And as good as this is, we're even getting better. We came up -- don't forget, the cupboard was bare. The other administration -- the last administration left us nothing. We didn't have ventilators,we didn't have medical equipment, we didn't have testing. The tests were broken. You saw that. We had broken tests. They left us nothing. And we've taken it and we have built an incredible stockpile -- a stockpile like we've never had before.\nYeah.\nWell, I'll be honest. I have a lot of things going on. We had a lot of people that refused to allow the country to be successful. They wasted a lot of time on Russia, Russia, Russia. That turned out to be a total hoax. Then they did Ukraine, Ukraine and that was a total hoax, then they impeached the president of the United States for absolutely no reason, and we even had 197-to-nothing vote by the Republicans.\nAnd essentially, the same thing by the -- by the, if you take a look at the Senate and the House, I mean it was the same thing. Look, what they've done and now they continue to do it. Remember this: when you see these numbers and testing, you're probably even surprised because I watch Chuckie Schumer get on television, and they have sound bites.\nNo matter what you do, it's never good enough. But you don't hear about ventilators anymore. That was a big problem. You don't hear about testing much anymore but the other night I saw him go on a show of a very unfunny comedian, and he looks at the camera, says, \"testing testing.\" They will complain, no matter how good we did. If we took these numbers -- 7 million. This is 7 million tests.\nAnd if I doubled or tripled it, they'd still say -- because it's a sound bite. Because they want to try and win an election, which hopefully they won't win because they're going to double everybody -- the taxes are going to double. All the problems that are going to have, and you're going to be back into a bad economy. We had the greatest economy ever, and we're going to do it again.\nSure.\nNo, I don't know -- I'd have to see his full statement. But look we've gotten along very well. Don't forget Governor Cuomo last week said the President and the federal government had done -- have done a phenomenal job. He said that.\nA phenomenal job.\nI can only tell you what he said last week. I mean, David, I can only tell you what he said last week. I mean, it wasn't -- two years ago. He said the President and the federal government have done a phenomenal job. That was the word he used and he's right.\nWe built him 2,900 beds. We moved the ship in. Now, they didn't use it too much, which I'm frankly happy about because they didn't need it because we were right about the numbers. We were actually right about the numbers, but we took the Javits Convention Center and made it into a major hospital in a period of four days. So he's been you know he's been actually very nice, I think.\nWell what they can do is they can look in little areas. For instance, in New York, we had a place in Westchester County that I know very well, which was where we started. That's where it all sort of like -- was what you first heard about, New York, and they did a good job. They circled it, they made sure, and it really went down, it was actually quite a good job.\nA couple of things. First of all, these models have been so wrong from day one. Both on the low side and the upside. They've been so wrong, they've been so out of whack. And they keep making new models, new models and they're wrong. Those models that you're mentioning are talking about without mitigation. Well we're mitigating and we've learned to mitigate, but we can be in place, work in place and also mitigate. Number two, if we did 100,000 and it's horrible, there shouldn't be one, you've heard me say 100 times, we shouldn't have lost anybody.\nThis was something that could have been stopped in China, and they should have stopped it. But if we lose one life it's too many. But the fact is, the low end, it was 100 to 120,000 to over 200 and 250,000. If we're at 100,000, if we didn't do what we did, we could have lost 2 million people. We could have lost two and a half and 3 million people, but we did something that was courageous, very expensive, but it was the right thing to do.\nYou know, there's a hospital in Queens right near where I grew up, and a very, very -- Elmhurst -- a very, very sad situation. I saw one day 11 body bags of dead people. Multiply that by 20 if we did it a different way. You know, you talk about herd. We did it a different way, multiply that number times almost minimum -- minimum 20.\nWe've done it right, but now we have to get back to work. We have to do it. And just one thing, if I could. I think the American people have to consider themselves now -- and I am considering them to be warriors. We are warriors. We are fighting a war against an invisible enemy. We are warriors, and we have to go back to work and that's what they want to do.\nThey have. They have.\nRight.\nYeah.\nWell, the upper number was, as you know, 2.2 million people. And then there are some, some models or charts that showed higher than that. But 2.2 million people. I always felt 60, 65, 70 -- as, as horrible as that is. I mean, you're talking about filling up Yankee Stadium with death. So I thought it was horrible, but it's probably going to be somewhat higher than that.\nIn the meantime, what we can say is this: other countries aren't producing the correct numbers.\nAnd when you look at mortality rates, we're doing better than almost all countries on mortality rate. We're doing a better job. When you look at the job our hospitals have done, they've done fantastically well. Look, this is a very unpleasant situation. This is a situation -- who would have ever thought a thing like this could happen? Frankly, I've read about and heard about, in 1917, The Great Flu. They call that the Flu, right? The Spanish flu, and it might have killed 100 million people.\nProbably stopped the First World War ‘cause all the soldiers were getting sick. I mean, it, you know, was probably a cause of stopping the -- a World War. But that was our worst. This is a different one. Not as lethal, individually, but more contagious. The level of contagion -- the level of its being contagious has never seen before. Nobody's ever seen anything like this before. The people of this country have done a great job. But now I'm looking at them, and I think they're looking at themselves, as being warriors.\nWe're warriors. We're fighting something that should have never happened but it's an invisible enemy, and it's tough and it's smart. So --\n-- will it happen to other people? Yes, it could happen to me and it could happen to you. And I'm prepared for that. But look, we're out and we're distancing. We're far away, and a lot of things are happening. We've changed. But I look forward to the day when we can sit next to each other, when you can interview me from a normal -- where I'm not shouting to reach you, where you're not shouting to reach me, and that will happen again.\nI said the other day, when Alabama has a football game against LSU, I don't want 20,000 people in the stands with seven empty seats in between everybody. I want 110,000 people like they got. And they get even more than that -- that's what I want.\nWe're gonna get back to our normal life.\nI hope it's gonna be soon.\nSomebody said to me, like, everybody's longing for the rallies. We all have a lot of fun at my rallies. And --\nI hope we can do that soon. I mean, I hope we can do that. I can't have a rally with, you know, 7 seats in between everybody. And I hope we can do that soon. The rallies are the least of it, but you know, people are asking me all the time. Just last night, I got three calls -- \"When are we gonna do a rally?\" I said, \"Just relax. Take it easy.\" But we're gonna do -- I hope before the election.\nI mean, you know, for -- for our people, for this country, we need sporting events. We need stadiums. We don't need stadiums one-third full. third. A -- a owner, in a call actually, told me -- he said, \"Well, we expect to have half crowds by a certain --. \" I said, \"Do you expect ever to have full crowds?\" \"Well, I didn't think about it.\" I said, \"You better start thinking about it because I want these arenas full.\" You know, the virus will pass.\nThere'll be more death, that the virus will pass, with or without a vaccine. And I think we're doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it's going to pass, and we're going to be back to normal. But it's been a rough process. There is no question about it.\nYeah. You can never be convinced -- when you're saying, \"am I convinced?\" -- I could say this: we're doing really great. Oxford, Johnson and Johnson -- these companies, and I get reports every single day, they're doing really great. Am I convinced? I can't be convinced of anything. But I think that we have a really good shot of having something very, very substantial. Look at Gilead with Remdesivir [Trump pronounces as Rem-dem-severe] which just came out.\nAnd that -- that is a big impact. You know, I've been watching a lot of people where their lives were saved. There's a lot of great things happening.\nI like therapeutics even more because it solves a current problem. The vaccines are great, but you know the vaccines take longer because of the testing and because of what they have to do. The therapeutics -- we're making tremendous progress on therapeutics.\nWell, that is what it is. And you know, it's very interesting. Even the Democrats aren't blaming me for that. We had to close it up and we saved millions of lives and we did the right thing. Now we're getting back to work. The third quarter, I think, is going to be -- I call it a transition quarter. A lot of people -- you see it. I'll tell you what. I got on the plane today, there was such spirit. People are starting to feel -- we land in Arizona, I leave from DC, I get calls from everybody, all over the country. I just spoke to the governor of Florida. Florida is really active.\nI mean, a lot of these states are really getting back into gear. There's a spirit out there right now that's pretty incredible. But even the Democrats, they're not hitting me with \"Oh gee, it's your fault\" from that standpoint. Nobody's blaming me. What I want to do is, we have a transition period coming. I think the fourth quarter will be very good. And I think next year is going to be one of the best years we've ever had, economically. There is a pent up demand that's incredible. The oils going back up.\nWe're going to start saving some energy jobs. I really think next year is going to be one of the best years we've ever had.\nWatch it happen.\nWell, we've done a lot for that. We've done our small business, as you know, our PPP, paycheck, if you want to call it that, where small businesses are given billions of dollars, so that they can take care of their employees. We've done a lot of other -- look, we've done $2 trillion. And it's actually close to three if you really add it up but $2 trillion has been approved, and we'll probably do more. It's a stimulus. It's to keep people employed, to keep small businesses open.\nWe just saved the airlines. We just put up 25 billion and 25 billion we're saving the airlines. They are paying a price for it, but we're saving the airlines. The airlines were doing the best business they've ever done, Daivd, the best. And then one day, boom, they have no business left. I mean it's gone. So we just saved the airlines. A big thing is Boeing just went out to the market, you saw that. They didn't need us to save them. They went out, they floated a bond issue for $25 billion at a very decent rate. That means the markets are working. It's a beautiful thing.\nLook, I think that you're gonna have a very, very terrific transition third quarter. I see it happening. The spirit I see now. People are calling. It's an incredible spirit that's going on, and I'm a person that believes in spirit because you need spirit for success.\nSo we've funded the unemployment, as you know, and the problem is and I didn't want to do -- I wanted it to go directly to people -- the Democrats wanted it to go through the system. The system is based on, in many states, not -- here I think was very good in Arizona, but many states have 45 year old computers, and they can't handle it and I said that's what's going to happen. The money's coming but they have to see the state. The state, some of the states are not adjusted for this kind of money. They have old equipment. They have old worn out equipment. You know, you have really well managed states in this country, and you have some that aren't so well managed, but they have the money.\nThey have to get the money out. Again, I would have rather sent the money directly. They wanted it to go through the unemployment, through the system and exactly what I said. I told you, I told you a lot of people exactly what I said has happened in some cases, where the equipment can't handle the money. But it's going to get out. That's the state's problem.\nBut we'll take over that problem if they don't get the money out soon.\nIt's a very good question and it's a very difficult situation, and I have a media that's extremely hostile. And they have been from before I got elected, you know that, that's why it was called a miracle because I had a hostile media, which republicans do but I had more than any other -- you know, I even had a you know group of Republicans that have lost to me so badly they formed committees. They're a dying breed, but I've had tremendous lack of support from Democrats. They should -- we should all be in this together.\nI thought the one thing this is different at -- and what I really thought much different. I thought the Democrats -- because this is a crisis. I thought the Democrats would come together and work with us. They really don't. I see Schumer, you know, the guy is a loser from New York. Schumer's up there the other day. He doesn't know anything about testing, and he's on a show, and he's going testing, testing, testing. He didn't see charts like this, he doesn't see that. He probably knows. I'm sure he knows, but it's a soundbite. It's a political soundbite.\nThey don't use the ventilators anymore now they use the testing but now we've solved testing better than any country in the world. And they should be saying, Great job, not use it as a sound bite when they know it's not true. It's not good. So the one thing I'm most disappointed with, I never expected much from the media and I have to say this, you are included in this group. I know some great journalists, you've been very fair to me.\nI know some great journalists, but I know the vast majority. I've seen things that are so bad and so corrupt and so dishonest. It's a shame, especially when it comes to something like this, because our country needs spirit. And they should be given them the facts as to the positive. They can report the positive, there is positive also. There's horrible death that should have never happened. It should have never have been let out of China. It should have been stopped. It could have been stopped right there, when I talk about putting out the fires. They should have stopped it.\nThey didn't. They didn't know how. They probably made a big mistake. Maybe it was in confidence, maybe it was they made a mistake. Whatever it was, it wasn't good. It was very unfortunate. And you got to understand, I had just made a tremendous trade deal months before with China, where they're paying us billions and billions of dollars a month. And I made that, but to me, this supersede trade deals.\nSo let me, let me -- So I -- You would say, worse than that I said one person, one time. And it's true. There was a time when we had one person in this country. We knew about it. We worked on it. But we have one person, it mushroomed, thee 15 people, mushroomed. Other people were coming in, also from Europe. Don't forget --\nBut don't forget, in January -- Okay, let's talk about cases. You know why we're at a million cases? Because we have more testing than anybody else. If we tested as much as these countries down here, okay, who don't do very much testing at all. Look at Japan: very little testing. They're at the bottom of the rung.\nLook at South Korea, it gets so much publicity. The president of South Korea is a friend of mine. President moon. He called up, he said \"what you're doing with testing is amazing.\" If I tested this number of people instead of this number of people, I'd have far fewer -- if I -- see this line? It goes all the way up over 7 million tests. If I tested down here at 1 million tests, I would have a lot fewer cases too.\nThe know -- the news knows it. They said the other day -- In other words, the better I do with testing, the more I get beat up by saying, \"but you have more cases.\" I have more cases because I --\nNo, no. But look at look at your question,\nLook, let me, let me tell you this. I closed the border. If you want to use that term. I banned people from coming into China. There were approximately 40,000 Americans. If you were in my position, you you would -- you would let them come in. You could ask Ron Desantis, great governor of Florida. Those people went through quarantine, they went through tests, went through everything, but they were American citizens. I had to let them come back in.\nBut I came in, and what I did is, I said, against many people, including Anthony Fauci, who I like very much, including Deborah, who I like very much, the doctors, and many other people. They said \"Don't ban China, it's gonna blow over.\" And they said this at the end of February, you know, they were saying this at the end of February. In January, at the end of January, I banned people from China coming into the United States except for American citizens coming back, which you have to let them back but we let them back very carefully. Nobody ever did that before. Do you know it's the first time it's ever been done. And I had a room of 20 people, approximately in the Oval Office.\nI was the only one that wanted to do it. And we had professionals, we had doctors, David, I was the only one that wanted to do it. And if I didn't do that Dr. Fauci said this, we would have lost thousands and thousands, tens of thousands more lives, but I banned China which is the primary source from coming in. Then, not too long after that, I banned Europe because we saw what was going over--what was happening in Europe.\nIt's, it's, I think we did a phenomenal job. Nancy Pelosi was out there at the end of February, talking about let's go dancing in Chinatown in San Francisco, because she wanted to prove that there was no problem. But there was a problem. Schumer was talking in March, about there's no problem. I banned people from coming in, in January.\nNow, at the same time, I want to be optimistic. I don't want to be Mr. Gloom and Doom. It's a very bad subject. I'm not looking to tell the American people when nobody really knows what's happening yet, Oh, this is going to be so tragic. I want to be -- aside from everything else, and I'm going to use a term, and some people love it. and some people hate it, but I love it. I want to be a cheerleader for our country. I don't want to be Mr. Doom and Gloom. So, here I am in January banning, at the same time, I want to be optimistic, but they have a thing -- for instance they do false ads.\nThey said I called it a hoax. No, I called the Democrats a hoax because of what they were saying because when I did the ban they're out there saying -- they call me a racist because I did the ban. They called me xenophobic. Sleepy Joe Biden. He said he's xenophobic. He doesn't know what the word means. He's xenophobic. That's a terrible thing to call somebody. Then four or five weeks later, he sent out a statement that he agreed with what I did, but nobody picked up the statement. Look, we have handled a very bad situation very well.\nWe started off with very few medical supplies. By the way, in the military. We started off with a depleted military with no ammunition. My first week in the office I was told we have no ammunition. Now we have the greatest military we've ever built. $1.5 trillion, you know because you reported on it. Same thing with medical. The shelves were bare, the cupboards were bare. We built unbelievable ventilate -- the ventilators now are being built by the thousands. You know we're doing with ventilators now? We're helping Italy, France, Spain, Nigeria, various countries all over the world.\nThey're calling us for ventilators, and we have so many now that we're able to give them or do whatever deal we make, but I would say it's a great -- it's a great thing to help people in distress. They can't make ventilators. You know, it's a very complicated process. It's a big machine, and a complex machine. We're giving these ventilators to people and countries all over the world. We've got more than we can use. Governor Cuomo said he needed 40,000 ventilators. I said you don't need that much, Dr. Birx said you don't need that much.\nWe gave him the amount that he needed which was about 4,000 and he actually gave some recently to Massachusetts where they needed a --We have so many ventilators now. And it was a bad word for -- Two months ago nobody thought a thing like this could happen. And it's companies like Honeywell and General Motors and General Electric and a lot of our greatest companies. 3M really came through in the end. 3M with the face masks and other things they've done. We have mobilized -- this is the greatest mobilization since World War Two.\nAnd I'll tell you what, I don't need the credit. I should get credit, but I don't need the credit. Who should get the credit is FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, and all of the millions of people that worked to get this done. You know, when we sailed the ship in, the comfort, we have the comfort and the mercy. The Mercy is in California, and they were very -- the governor there has been very gracious about it and other things too. But when we had the comfort come into New York harbor, we had a lot of doctors, they weren't expecting this. They were not set up for COVID-19.\nThey were set up for regular things like car accidents and appendix and a lot of other things. We converted the ship over. When they didn't use it that much because frankly the numbers fortunately never hit a point where we needed it that much, those doctors and the doctors from the Javits Center went all over New York and parts of New Jersey, and they worked with other professionals. And the other professionals have told me to a T. Governor Cuomo told me, Mayor De Blasio told me.\nYour great governor of New Jersey who's done a -- Phil has done a fantastic job, told me, he said these people were so professional it was un -- they'd walk into a room and everybody stood up. These are the medical professionals from the military. They walked into a room and everybody stood up and he said they gave them spirit when they saw these people walk in and these are dangerous rooms. These are warriors. And just to finish.\nI watch and I see people walking into hospitals, and people from buildings, many, many different locations singing, and in some cases you have people from Lincoln Center and from, you know, great musicians playing the horns and instruments. And I watch police and firemen applauding as they walk in, but I see things that I've never quite seen before I would imagine, other than actual warfare.\nYoung men and women and some older and some doctors rushing through doors into a very dangerous building, a hospital, putting on outfits as the doors are opening and trying to get everything set. They're not outside taking their time. I'll tell you what, it's a beautiful thing to watch, David. I've never seen anything like it.\nThey are warriors.\nBut you know what, the people of our country are warriors too. And that's what I'm saying, they have to think of themselves as warriors. We can't sit in a house for the next three years. We can't do it.\nRight.\nI want to say: \"I love you.\" I want to say that we're doing everything we can. I also want to say that we're trying to project people over 60 years old. We're trying so hard and -- everything I've said today -- I'd like to preface it by saying, if you're 60 years old and especially if you're 60 or even less than that and you've had a heart condition or you've had diabetes or a problem of any kind -- it seeks out problems. This is a vicious -- it seeks out weakness, in terms of medical --\nIf somebody has any form of a heart problem or diabetes -- anything -- it seeks it out. It's a vicious ,vicious virus. But I want to just say to the people that have lost family and have lost loved ones, and the people that have just suffered so badly, and just made it -- and just made it -- that we love you. We're with you. We're working with you. We're supplying vast amounts of money, like never before. We want that money to get to the people. and we want ‘em to get better.\nAnd we want them -- you can never really come close to replacing, when you've lost some -- no matter how well we do next year, I think our economy is going to be raging. It's going to be so good. No matter how well, those people can never ever replace somebody they love. But we're going to have something that they're going to be very proud of. And to the people that have lost someone, there's nobody -- I don't sleep at night thinking about it. There's nobody that's taken it harder than me. But at the same time I have to get this enemy defeated. And that's what we're doing, David. That's what we're doing.\nWell, I am and I'm not. You know, it's a very, it's a very interesting thought. You know I've built the greatest economy and then it was turned off for good reason. We saved millions of lives by doing it. I think people are going to remember that. I think they're going to remember that I rebuilt the military, I think they're going to remember that I gave them the biggest tax cuts in history. I gave them the greatest regulation cuts by far in history. I've given them the best job numbers in history. I've rebuilt our military to a level it's never been built, I mean, look, I got for the veterans, I got Choice. They've been trying to get Choice for 50 years.\nMeaning a veteran is sick and can't get to a doctor, you go outside and we pay the bill. Nobody has ever done these things, and I've saved their second amendment. You wouldn't have a second amendment right now if it wasn't for me. And one other thing, I've always heard judges are the most important thing that a president can do. I set a record on judges. 252 judges. It's unthinkable. Every judge is so important.\n252 judges, two Supreme Court justices. Nobody's ever done things like this. So, I hope it's not solely on what I've done here because this is a very, this is like rubber. It's very very amorphous. But you know what, I think in a certain way, and I hope I can say this to you in a couple of months. I think in a certain way maybe our best work has been on what we've done with COVID-19, but, but we haven't gotten-- We haven't been treated properly.\nNot me, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, the medical people, the police, the nurses, -- everybody, even the doctors, they haven't been treated properly. The job they've done is a miracle. We're low in morbidity, we're number one on testing, we're number one -- again -- on ventilators and everything. Not number one, we're number one -- there is no number two through ten. We're way ahead of every other country in the world, and very important -- it's so important.\nI think we're doing very well in vaccines, and we're doing very well therapeutically. I think we're gonna have some great answers and, hopefully by the next time we meet, we'll have some of those answers.\nThank you very much.\nAppreciate it.\nVery much.\nI'd love to shake your hand.\nThank you, thank you, David. Great job.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-david-muir-abc-news-world-news-tonight"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-05-11", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. We're here today to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States, the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world, by far. This afternoon I'll also announce new steps that we're taking to make tests even more widely available.\nTo battle a virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our Nation's disposal: public, private, military, economic, scientific, and industrial, all at your disposal. We launched the largest manufacturing ramp-up since the Second World War. There's been nothing like it since.\nAt the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities. In the span of just a few short months, we've developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it's not even close. This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America. And we're opening, and we're starting, and there's enthusiasm like I haven't seen in a long time.\nEvery American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill, and enterprise our Nation has brought to this challenge. In 3 months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States. Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day. Now we're doing approximately 300,000 tests per day—a 100-percent increase—and it will go up substantially from that number.\nThis week, the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted, nearly double the number of any other country. We're testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland, and many other countries—and in some cases, combined.\nOn Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen tests, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured. Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point-of-care test, estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks.\nTo further expand our Nation's testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration is—and that we've got this all approved; it's all done—is sending $1 billion to America's States, Territories, and Tribes. So this has all been approved. We've gotten it done, completed. The money is going out. This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on Earth by far.\nI said from the beginning that the Federal Government would back up the States and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that's exactly what's happened. This partnership has truly flourished. We have really had a very good relationship with the States and the Governors and other representatives within the States, a relationship like, I think I can honestly say, has not been seen in this country for many, many years.\nThe Governors and us are working together very closely not only on testing, but on ventilators, where we have a capacity that's, at this point, virtually unlimited. And we're sending ventilators—as you probably heard from other countries, we're sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they're in tremendous need. And I think building up a lot of good will, but much more importantly than that, we're saving a lot of lives. Most States are now doing a great job. My administration located 5,000 machines in 700 labs across all 50 States, and Governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources. The Federal Government is also supporting States with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one-on-one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly.\nIn recent weeks, we've held multiple conference calls with every State, as well as with DC and Puerto Rico. We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each State for the month of May, altogether totaling 12.9 million tests. Think of that: 12.9 million tests.\nToday I'm announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help States meet their targets and meet them rapidly. During the month of May, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swabs to States nationwide. We already have them; the delivery will be very quick. We're prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any State is on a pace to surpass its goal. And their goals are very high. We've set them very high; we've told them to set them very high.\nMy administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing. A complicated process, but we've made it simple. As a result of these actions, every single State will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in 4 months since the outbreak began.\nThis major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher. Some of these incredible companies produced and produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon. These are all different products that were literally just developed and—if you can imagine that. And these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world. And other countries are calling us, and we're trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing.\nMy administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities. Through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that's in addition to all of the other sites that we have working. Seventy percent of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities.\nThere will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days. These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community. My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy.\nIn addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90 million N95 masks, and these are of the highest quality—many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn't have at all at the beginning—126 million surgical masks—likewise, many are made here; 9 million face shields; 21 million surgical gowns; 993 million gloves; and 10,690 ventilators. We're building thousands of ventilators in numerous plants all across our country. It's incredible, actually.\nThis global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people. It should have never been allowed to happen. It should have been stopped at the source. We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one, and that goes worldwide too—many, many countries, 184 countries, at least.\nThanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved. And we have saved—and if you look at on a per-100,000 basis, we're at the best part of the pack, right on the bottom. Germany and us are leading the world. Germany and the United States are leading the world: lives saved per hundred thousand.\nIn every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment, and we have prevailed. Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs, and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory.\nDay after day, we're making tremendous strides. With the dedication of our doctors and nurses—these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors—with the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy, and we will transition into greatness. That's a phrase you're going to hear a lot, because that's what's going to happen.\nWe're going into the third quarter, and we're going to do well. In the fourth quarter, we're going to do very good. And next year, I think we're going to have one of the best years we've ever had, because there's a tremendous pent-up demand. It's a demand—and I'm feeling it. I've felt things a lot over my life, and I've made a lot of good calls. It's a demand like I don't think I've ever seen. There's a pent-up demand. There's a spirit of this country like few have seen. And I think you can say—and we've helped a lot of the countries a lot. Really, a lot. There's a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing.\nBut we're transitioning to greatness, and the greatness is going to be in the fourth quarter, but it's really going to be next year, and it's going to be a year like we've never had before. I really believe that. As good as we've done—and we've done great; we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world. You can talk China, you can talk any other country—we had the best economy anywhere in the world.\nAnd we were going for numbers, whether it was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers; employment, also, numbers—a little different—where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people. All of that—we had the greatest stock market numbers ever. I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time. A hundred and fifty-two days, we set records in the stock market. We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States. All of our equipment built—$1.5 trillion plus.\nOn the southern border, the wall is being built. It's being built rapidly. And now you don't hear the opponents talking too much about the border. They don't like to talk about it, because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things. One of the things we were right about—one of the many things was the border. We have a very powerful border. Now, we had one of the best weeks in the history of our border, between the United States and Mexico—our southern border. We have very few people coming in—very, very few. Almost record low numbers.\nAnd the wall is being built. It's up to 181 miles already. It's being built. It's being built rapidly. People don't talk about it anymore because it's very successful. In the area where the wall has built—that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by a very short period of time. Early next year, we should be up to 450 and, very shortly after that, over 500 miles to be completed.\nBut it's had a tremendous impact. But again, we've had the best numbers. The last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our southern border. And again, we're doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers.\nSo I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir—if you could, please come up and Brad, if you would—Brad Smith. And they're going to do a little explaining as to what we've done with regard to testing and how successful it's been. And then, we'll take some questions after that. Thank you very much.\nAssistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Health Brett P. Giroir.Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration. And thank you, Secretary Azar, for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I the opportunity to work on this project.\nI think it's clear that America does lead the world in testing. I'll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively. I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem to keep America safe. And clearly, as we've said multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality.\nSo let's start potentially with the next slide.\n[At this point, Assistant Secretary Giroir presented and discussed a series of slides detailing U.S. coronavirus testing capacity. He concluded his remarks as follows.]\nAnd combined with that, the Secretary's Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of State, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked to the services that they need, not only testing, but in care as well.\nAnd with that, I'd like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who's the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together.\nThank you very much, Brad. And maybe you'll both stay there. Could be some questions.\nI don't think the system broke down at all. One person tested positive, surprisingly, because, the previous day, tested negative. And three people that were in contact—relative contact, who I believe they've all tested totally negative, but they are going to, for a period of time, self-isolate. So that's not breaking down. It can happen. It's the hidden enemy. Remember that. It's the hidden enemy. And so things happen. But the three tested negative. The one who tested positive will be fine. They will be absolutely fine.\nYes, John.\nWell, I think, you know, we have a lot of people in the White House. And we had one. Basically, we had one person. So—and we had a lot of people that work here. This building is shocking, if you looked at the numbers. And it's also tremendous numbers of people coming in. Normally, you wouldn't do that. But because we're running a country, we want to keep our country running. So we have a lot of people coming in and out. Many of those people—most of those people are tested depending on what portion of the Oval Office area they're going in. Everybody coming into the President's office gets tested. And I've felt no vulnerability whatsoever, John.\nBut the two people, as I said, and three people, are—they have been tested, and it's negative, and be probably out of quarantine very quickly. Okay?\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].\nVery soon. I mean, really, very soon. It's an interesting question, because normally, you would have said that \"you are not tested,\" and you would have been, you know, knocking us for not getting tested. So, if we get tested, it's a problem. And if we don't get tested, it's a problem.\nBut I like the way your question was phrased better this way, because it is a positive. We are tested; we have great capability. You look at all of these machines here. They're incredible machines. They're the best anywhere in the world. No place in the world has this kind of equipment. Other countries are calling—sophisticated countries—and they're calling. Lots of countries. And we're trying to make as much as we can available to them, because there's nothing like what we've been able to do in a—literally a couple of months.\nWhat they've been able to do—the private sector, what they—how they got it done. This is a 5- to 15-minute test, as an example—the Abbott Laboratories test. These tests are highly sophisticated—very quick, very good. This is things that didn't even exist a short while ago.\nSo we do have a great testing capability at the White House. We're doing it. And I think, generally speaking—we had a call with the Governors the other day—generally speaking, without exception, they were all extremely happy with what's going on, with respect to their testing. Okay?\nResumption of Economic and Commercial Activity Q.But should people be told to go back to work until they have that assurance that they and their coworkers are able to get a test——\nYes.\nWe're leaving that up to the Governors, as you know. And if we see something wrong, we'll call them out, and we'll stop it. But we are leaving it up to the Governors. Some are being not aggressive enough, in my opinion, and some are being a little bit aggressive, but they're being very careful.\nAnd the people of the country, they've learned a lot over the last 2 months. They've learned about social distancing and washing your hands and other things that we've all learned and talked about. They've learned about—I see everybody—just about everybody has a face mask on. They've learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It's not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.\nBut our country has learned. Our country has been incredible. And you see the numbers; they're dropping very substantially. The numbers are dropping around our country very, very substantially.\nSo we leave that, Jon, up to the Governors, and I think they're making a lot of good decisions. We've had, as I said, a great relationship with Governors, Democrat and Republican. And I think, overall, they're making very good decisions.\nNobody in this group. All of the ones behind the rope. That's interesting. Please.\nNo, we've prevailed on testing, is what I'm referring to. That was with regard to testing. You never prevail when you have 90,000 people, 100,000 people; when you have 80,000 people, as of today; when you have this—the kind of death you're talking about, when you have potentially millions of people throughout the world that are dying. That's not prevailed——\nWhat I'm talking about is: We have a great testing capacity now. It's getting even better. There's nobody close to us in the world. And we certainly have done a great job on testing. And testing is a big—is a very big, important function. By the way, some people consider it more important than others, to be honest with you. But testing certainly is a very important function, and we have prevailed. We have the best equipment anywhere in the world.\nOkay, please. Yes. Please, go ahead.\nSo what else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I'm not happy with China. They should have stopped this at the source. They could have stopped it right at the source. So now you're telling me they're hacking? So I just say this, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters]: What else is new?\nWe're watching it very closely.China-U.S. Trade Agreement\nNo. Not at all. Not even a little bit. No, I'm not interested. We signed the deal. I had heard that too: They'd like to reopen the trade talk to make it a better deal for them.\nChina has been taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, for decades, because we had people at this position, right here where I'm standing, sitting right in that office—the Oval Office—that allowed that to happen.\nNo, I'm not interested in that. Let's see if they live up to the deal that they signed. Okay?\nPlease, go ahead.\nWell, we're talking about that with a lot of different people. I want to see a payroll tax cut. I want to see various things that we want. I want the workers to be taken care of.\nBut we are talking about that. We're negotiating with the Democrats. We'll see what happens. But as I said, it's a transition, and it's a—this is really going to be, in my opinion—we'll see, but I think it's going to be something that's going to be very special. It's a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we're going to do fantastically well.\nI view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. It could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you're going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think. And next year, you're going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before, and maybe even better, because there is that pent-up demand that is—you know, a lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they've had to hold back because of the virus.\nSo I think you're going to have, with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes—doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes. Like a certain party, namely the Democrats want to do. You'll mess it all up.\nYou know, we had the greatest in the world. I presided—this administration presided—over it. It got great for a reason. And we'll do it again, and we'll do it very quickly and very easily. I see that happening.\nYes, ma'am. Please.\nWell, if they're a certain distance from me or if they're a certain distance from each other, they do. In the case of me, I'm not close to anybody. I'd like to be close to these two gentlemen. They're hard-working, great men, but they just said, frankly, \"Let's keep it this way.\" So, obviously, in my case, I'm very far away from everyone. But if you look at all of those people over there, every one of them from what I see—these are White House staffers, they're White House representatives, they're White House executives, and everybody has a mask on.\nWe've had—just about everybody I've seen today has worn a mask.\nYes, I did. I did. I required it. Yes.\nWell, it's a true statement already. We have more testing than any country in the world by far. But I'll let Admiral go into a little bit of the future.\nPhil [Philip Rucker, Washington Post], go ahead.\nYes.\nAnd you know what? If we didn't get the tests, if we did no tests in the White House, you'd be up complaining, \"Why aren't you getting tests for the White House?\" See, we can't win, because if we didn't get the tests, you'd be up—I understand you very well, better than you understand yourself—and frankly, if we didn't get tests done, you'd be up complaining about the fact that we didn't have the tests done. Now that we're doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast—5 minutes, et cetera—and so accurate, you're complaining that we're getting too many tests. So you can't win.\nGo ahead, Phil.\nWell, when you say \"some,\" so we have a person and the person got—something happened right after a test was done. Three other people met that person, came into relative contact—very little contact—and they're self-quarantining. That is not exactly not controlling it. We—I think we've controlled it very well.\nWe have hundreds and hundreds of people a day pouring into the White House. It's a massive office complex, including the very large building right behind us that you know so well. So I think we're really doing a very good job in watching it. And I think it's very well contained actually.\nAnd part of the reason, it is because of all the tests we're able to give. But it was one person, and the other people were only people—they're quarantined. You understand this, Phil; they're quarantined for a specific reason. The reason is, they were in the general proximity of the one person. And the one person, I believe, will be fine in a very short period of time.\nWell, that, I'm going to have to ask that he will give you that information. Whatever he is proceeding and doing, he will give you that information. I'll make sure that they put out a notice.\nYes.\nYes, we're seeing that all over the world now with young children. A very, very tiny percentage, but it's still—it's the swelling and the skin rash. And we're looking at that very closely, John. It's a phenomenon that's just been brought to everyone's attention a couple of weeks ago.\nAdmiral, you may have something to say about that.\nWell, again it's a tiny percentage. But you're right, so we're looking into it very strongly. And the admiral, as he said, he's known about this for long before this happened. But it is a very, very small percentage. And people recover from that; the children recover from that. Right?\nWe're studying that very closely, and it's been on the radar for weeks actually, because we've seen this for quite a while. But it's been very rare, but we're looking at it very closely. It's very important to us.\nI think one of the things we're most proud of is—this just came out—deaths per 100,000 people, death—so deaths per 100,000 people: Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning, low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people, which, frankly, to me, that's perhaps the most important number there is.\nPlease, go in the back, please.\nWell, the Vice President, first of all, has been tested, and he's negative—and was tested yesterday, tested today, and he's negative. He's in very good shape. And I think that that's going to be fine.\nAs far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test. That's the problem with a question like that. We go through a whole announcement saying \"We're number one in the world by far,\" by a factor of two, and even three and four depending on where you're looking, and I get a question, \"When will everybody be able to get tested?\" If somebody wants to be tested right now, they'll be able to be tested.\nAs far as the incident, I think it's horrible, and it's certainly being looked at by many people. I'm speaking to many people about it. He looked—I saw the picture of him in his tuxedo; it was so beautiful. I mean, he looks like a wonderful, young guy. Would have been a wonderful—I mean, just a wonderful guy. I think it's a horrible thing. I think it's a horrible thing.\nNow, with that being said, as you know, they're studying the case very carefully. They're interviewing everybody involved, and we'll see what happens. To me, it's a very sad thing.\nI spoke to a number of people that are very much involved in it. I've been following that one very closely. It breaks your heart to watch it. It breaks your heart. And certainly, the video was a—it was a terrible-looking video to me.\nBut you have a lot of people looking at it, and hopefully, an answer is going to be arrived at very quickly. But it's something that is heartbreaking.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nWell, I saw the tape, and when they moved left, I don't believe—when they moved left, outside of the tape, nobody saw what was going on. Nobody saw it. It's an empty spot on the tape, I guess.\nNow, do they have additional tapes? I hope. But I will say that it's something that, based on what I saw, doesn't look good. Somebody that I have a lot of respect for is Senator Scott of South Carolina, you know who I'm talking about. He's a great gentleman. He's a great Senator. He's a great gentleman. Tim Scott. And I called him 2 days ago. I said: \"Tim, what do you think? Tell me. What do you think?\" He's very disturbed by it. He's very disturbed. And I'm very disturbed also.\nPlease, go ahead.\nNo, we just wanted to make sure that we had the proper machinery apparatus and everything else out there before people started wasting money. It's a method of saving money. We wanted to make sure we had even things like this. Plus, they have machines that are far more complex than this. They have massive machines at some of the laboratories that can do millions of tests. We wanted to make sure everything was in place. Okay?\nGo ahead.\nWell, I think that if you look at Pennsylvania, as an example; if you look at various other States—I won't get into them—the people want to go back. The numbers are getting to a point where they can, and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue States to get back into gear. And the people aren't going to stand for it; they want to get back.\nThey're not going to stand for it. They want our country opened. I want our country opened too. I want it opened safely, but I want it open.\nDon't forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route: Everything is closed up, you're in your house, you're not allowed to move. People are dying with that too. You look at drug addiction, you look at suicides, you look at some of the things that are taking place, people are dying that way too. You could make the case, it's in even greater numbers.\nSo it's a situation that some people—and I've noticed that some States could be moving more quickly. And also, at the same time, safety. Look, safety is paramount. But people are dying in the lockdown position too. And everybody understands that. They're just starting to find out. And look at what's going on with drugs, and look at what's happening with suicides.\nYes, please. Please, go ahead.\nWell, excuse me. There are 20,000—the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. I mean, the numbers are really coming down, and very substantially. And this weekend was one of the lowest we've had. This is—you know, the numbers are coming down very rapidly all throughout the country, by the way. There may be one exception. But all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly. I think you see that, Admiral.\nWell, the models haven't been exactly accurate. These are models done by a lot of think tanks, a lot of universities. If you look at some of the models, they have been way off. Few of the models have been accurate.\nBut as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people. And because we took—we mitigated—we did things that were very tough for our country to do, frankly. We had to turn off our whole magnificent economy. We had to turn down the whole country. We're at the lowest of all of the models.\nI mean, if you look at, I guess, one-hundred-and-twenty—100- to 120,000 people would be at the low side. And we're at—there's nothing low. Look, nothing low. One is too many people. And I say it all the time: One person to lose for this is too many people. It's a disgrace what happened.\nBut if you look at the models, we're at a low—at the lowest of those projections. But the models are not models done necessarily by the White House. They're models done by many people all over the world. And if you take the most respected of those people, many of those models are wrong. I mean, they've been wrong as far as the U.S. is concerned, because those numbers are nowhere near what was projected, potentially.\nFederal Coronavirus Response/Restrictions on Travel From China to the U.S.\nYou know what? I don't want to think about it, even. I know that we're doing everything we can. We're doing a good job. We acted very early. We acted extremely early in keeping China out of our country and banning people from China coming in, other than our citizens, which we obviously had to take. And they were quarantined or watched carefully. They were tested. They were watched very carefully.\nBut we had about 40,000 people coming in from China, from Asia, and we had to obviously take the people. Can you imagine if I said, \"You're a U.S. citizen, and we're not going to take you\"? That doesn't work.\nSo—but they were very carefully—I was with Ron DeSantis. He said they put—literally put the people that came in from China in quarantine for a substantial period of time.\nNo, that was a big decision. I think we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by acting very early. And when I did this—I think the admiral can say it—everybody was against my doing it. Everybody. Everybody was: the professionals, the doctors. I was pretty much by myself on that one. And it was a lucky thing we did it, because we saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWell, I would certainly consider that. I will mandate it if you'd like. I would—I think it's important to do, and I think, frankly, some of the Governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes. It was obvious right from the beginning. The State of Washington, where 26 or 28 people died very early on. And I would have said, \"nursing homes.\" And I did say \"nursing homes.\" That's what they should. Now, some of the States—many of the States are doing that, but I think all of the States should be. They have the capacity to do it. They should be doing nursing home. That is a real vulnerability.\nI'm only aware of people that saw them, were tested, the tests were negative, and they're quarantining anyway. So——\nPlease, go ahead.\nWell, first of all, the job he's done on Task Force, the job he's done, frankly, as the Vice President of the United States has been outstanding. And he's a warrior too, just like doctors and nurses. I mean, he is working so hard, and he meets—he's coming into contact with a lot of people. But again, he tested negative, so we have to understand that. But he comes into contact with a lot of people.\nIt's something probably, during this quarantine period, we'll probably talk about. I have not seen him since then. But I would say that he will—he and I will be talking about that. Yes, we could talk on the phone.\nPlease.\nOkay?\nGo ahead. Phil.\nYes.\nYou know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.\nJon, please.\nYes.\nYes.\nWell, I'm going to have the admiral—but I will say, just from listening and hearing, like you do—we all do—not everybody should get a test because they have to have certain things. And they're going to know when they're not feeling right. Those are the people that will be getting the test. But, Admiral, I'll let you take it from there, please.\nAnd the meatpacking plants now are doing very well. There's great testing around those plants. And we're finding out who had the problem. They're being quarantined. And the meatpacking is moving along very nicely.\nBut they were trouble spots. They were hot zones, definitely.\nIf people want to get tested, they get tested. We have the greatest capacity in the world. Not even close. If people want to get tested, they get tested. But, for the most part, they shouldn't want to get tested. There's no reason. They feel good. They don't have sniffles. They don't have sore throats. They don't have any problem. If they do feel there's something happening, they have the absolute—easy. In fact, Ron DeSantis of Florida, the Governor—doing a fantastic job in Florida—he said he's got a little bit of the opposite problem. He's got so much testing that people sit around and wait for people to come in, that they have far—a great overcapacity for testing. And there are numerous other States that have told me the same thing. That's, by the way, a good problem, not a bad problem. Okay?\nYes, go ahead, please.\nYes.\nWell, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me; ask China that question, okay? When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer.\nI'm telling you. I'm not saying it specifically to anybody. I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.\nOkay. Anybody else? Please, go ahead. In the back. Please.\nNext. Next, please.\n——the young lady in the back. Please.\n——ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1241"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Andrzej Duda of Poland", "Date": "2020-06-24", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, everyone. Please. Thank you. Beautiful day in the Rose Garden. And I want to thank everybody for being here with us. We all know what a wonderful country and a great country Poland is.\nAnd it's my honor to have a friend of mine here, President Duda of Poland, who has done an incredible job. And I do believe he has an election coming up, and I do believe he'll be very successful. So thank you very much and all of your representatives. Thank you very much for being here.\nThis is the third time that we've hosted President Duda. The First Lady and I also cherish our remarkable visit to Poland 3 years ago. That was an amazing event. We had an event, because it was a speech, and a lot of people watched that speech. But it was a very historic moment and an important moment for our two countries.\nThe American and Polish people enjoy one of the world's oldest, strongest, and most enduring friendships. Polish patriots battled by our side to secure American independence. American and Polish warriors fought and died together to defeat the Nazis in World War Two. The United States stood shoulder to shoulder with Poland in its courageous struggle against communist oppression. Our bond has been forged in battle, sealed in blood, and strengthened by our shared cultural values.\nThe United States and Poland are united by our firm conviction that Western civilization has advanced, really—and very much advanced, I think I have to add—the cause of human progress beyond measure, and that it must be strongly defended and will, at all times, be strongly defended. And we will defend it together.\nIn our meeting today, President Duda and I reaffirmed the vital alliance between our nations. Last year, we signed two joint declarations to increase our security collaboration, and we look forward to signing a defense cooperation agreement.\nPoland recently purchased 32 brandnew state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets—the best in the world—and Poland is one of only 8 NATO members—the others, some of them, haven't done so well in terms of what they're supposed to be paying to NATO. I tell them all the time. And we've gotten them up a lot, but not enough. But Poland is one of only 8 that is current with the money that they are supposed to be paying. That's the 2 percent. Two percent is a very low number.\nBut we have a large number of countries that haven't paid. They're delinquent. Let's put it that way. They're delinquent with respect to their dues, the money they're supposed to be paying for defense. So the United States is defending a lot of countries that are delinquent on what they're supposed to be paying, and I never feel too good about that.\nBut I will say I spoke with the Secretary General, and he said we've done a great job. But I said we haven't done good enough. We haven't done a good enough job.\nWe have secured, though, over $400 billion in new pledged defense spending from NATO members, which is something that no other administration has come even close to. I would say they're off by many, many hundreds of billions of dollars, something the newspaper doesn't like writing about, that the media doesn't like talking about. But we will be only satisfied when all members pay their fair share. Again, only eight members, plus the United States, is paying what is considered a fair share. I also applaud Poland and the Polish people for its devotion to safeguarding their country's borders. Very strong borders. And I just left our border, by the way. The wall is moving along rapidly, and our border is about as strong as it's ever been—our southern border.\nLast year, we were able to add Poland to the visa waiver program. And they wanted that very badly, and we gave it to them because they really deserve it. It's a testament to Poland's vigilant efforts to uphold the rule of law.\nThe United States and Poland have recently signed several long-term contracts for U.S. liquefied natural gas—they're a big purchaser of our energy—to enhance Poland's energy security. And we're working to conclude an agreement that would facilitates—facilitate Poland's development of nuclear energy plants throughout the purchase—they're going to be purchasing with one of our big, very good companies, technology, to do civilian nuclear energy.\nI want to congratulate Poland for its leadership in the Three Seas Initiative, a crucial energy partnership that will provide a reliable source of energy for Eastern Europe. And it will be free from the threat of foreign extortion. Poland understands foreign extortion very well. The Three Seas Initiative relies on fairness, transparency, and mutual benefit.\nOur nations have also collaborated on protecting our critical infrastructure and technology. That's why we've signed a 5G Joint Declaration, and Poland is leading the way in Europe by using trusted providers and provider equipment and supply chains for its 5G network. And we're working along with them, and they're using our companies.\nThe United States and Poland cooperate across a truly wide range of fronts that we're both very much involved in. Here today is the head of a Polish medical team—very advanced team, very brilliant team—fighting the coronavirus alongside of American doctors: Captain Siewiera. Captain—thank you for being here, Captain.\nAnd we're making great progress. I hear we're making great progress and we're working together. But we are making great progress on therapeutics and vaccines. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being here.\nThe American and Polish people have been true friends and trusted partners for almost 250 years. We are forever united by our shared belief in family, faith, law, liberty, democracy, and justice. As the old Polish motto goes, we will stand together in the name of God \"for our freedom and for yours.\"\nPresident Duda, let me express once again our gratitude for your visit and friendship. We have had a very, very special relationship. Our alliance is powerful and a very powerful testament to what free people can achieve together. And I believe that the greatness of our relationship lies ahead.\nThank you very much. President, please. Thank you.\nThank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. So we'll take a couple of questions, and you'll ask one to me and one to the President, and that would be great.\nSteve Holland [Reuters], go ahead.\nWell, just to start: As you know, Poland is—as I've said many times, Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO, in particular, their monetary obligations. And they asked us if we would send some additional troops. They're going to pay for that. They'll be paying for the sending of additional troops. And we'll probably be moving them from Germany to Poland.\nWe're going to be reducing Germany very substantially down to about 25,000 troops. We actually had 52,000, but we'll be moving it down to about 25,000. Germany is paying a very small fraction of what they're supposed to be paying. They should be paying 2 percent, and they're paying a little bit more than 1 percent, depending on how you calculate. You could also calculate they're paying—that they're paying less than 1 percent. But if you assume they're paying 1 percent, that's a tremendous delinquency. Let's use that word: \"delinquency.\" So we're going to be reducing our forces in Germany. Some will be coming home, and some will be going to other places. But Poland would be one of those other places—other places in Europe.\nI think it sends a very strong signal to Russia. But I think a stronger signal sent to Russia is the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia, and—through the pipeline. And I'm saying, \"What's that all about? You're spending billions of dollars to Russia, then we're supposed to defend you from Russia.\"\nSo I think it's a very bad—I think the people of Germany are very unhappy about it. I have many friends from Germany, and the people in Germany are very unhappy about it. They don't like it, but that's what they chose to do. So they're spending billions of dollars to buy Russian energy, and then we're supposed to defend them from Russia. So that doesn't work too well.\nBut Poland has been very, very terrific. In fact, I don't believe Poland is actually accepting any of the energy from the pipeline from Russia. So that sends a signal right there.\nWith all of that being said, we expect to get along with Russia; we expect to get along with everybody. But Germany has—they really owe a lot of money in NATO, and this has been going on for many years. When you add it all up, you're probably getting close to a trillion dollars. And that's not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn't treating the United States fairly.\nYou know, the United States is a very—is the major participant in NATO. We pay more than anybody else, by far; have for many, many years. So we defend Europe, but Europe also takes tremendous advantage of the United States on trade, advantage like you wouldn't believe. So we're trying to work that out.\nAnd I would imagine they'd like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than President Trump. But after the election, they'll just have to pay more, but that's the way it is. Okay?\nThank you very much. Please.\nThank you very much. I just want to add: 2014, which the President was talking about, that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and Sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us. It hasn't happened with us, and it won't happen with us either.\nPlease, go ahead.\nPoland-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Vaccine and Treatment Development\nYes, the answer is \"yes\" to going, and we'd like to do it again, as soon as we can. We have an election happening in this country, as you probably have heard. And so, I probably won't be able to do it until after the election. But assuming things go well, the answer is a very definite \"yes,\" actually.\nAs far as the joining with us on the vaccines and therapeutics, by the way, because the therapeutics to me—if I gave you a choice right now, probably, therapeutically, maybe I'd like that even better. But we're working very well on both. I think we're coming up with some great answers. I think you're going to have a big surprise—a beautiful surprise, sooner than anybody would think. But the answer is \"yes.\" We will be getting Poland involved, both in terms of helping, but also in terms of taking care of the Polish people once we have the vaccine. But I think we're going to have it very soon. Okay? Thank you.\nOkay. Thank you very much. John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nRight.\nWell, the Senate Republicans want very much to pass a bill on police reform. We have total cooperation with many different communities, including the police community. They want it very much to happen themselves, because there are things that they agreed to that they would like to agree to, and they would love to have it agreed to formally.\nThe Democrats don't want to do it, because they want to weaken our police. They want to take away immunity. They want to do other things that you know about as well as anybody in this beautiful field that we sit. They want to take away a lot of the strength from our police and from law enforcement, generally, and we can't live with that. We can't live with that.\nThis is a great bill, strongly endorsed by, as you know, Tim Scott, who's terrific, who is a terrific man, great Senator—South Carolina. And Mitch wants it to happen. I would like to see it happen. But we won't sacrifice. We won't do that. We won't do anything that's going to hurt our police.\nThe police—you know, we have a record this year on crime—a record positive rating on crime this year, the best. And you hear about certain places like Chicago, and you hear about what's going on in Detroit and other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. Twenty out of 20. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run. We have one city or two cities in particular—worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan. Worse than Afghanistan.\nAnd these are cities within the United States, Democrat run, radical-left run. You see what's going on in Seattle. You see what's going on in other places. Seattle, of all places—who would even think that's possible? Twenty out of 20. The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement and our police. And, frankly, they want to defund, largely—at least largely. There are some that want to defund and abolish our police, if you can believe that, and we're not letting that happen.\nSo if nothing happens with it, it's one of those things—we have different philosophies. They want open borders. They want sanctuary cities. We don't.\nAs far as your number—your second question, I think that we're going to have a very strong Executive order, but we already have very strong. We have the monuments act already, which—which means 10 years in jail. But I think we're going to consolidate various things. We're going to come out with a very strong Executive order, and I should have that by the end of the week, which is fast approaching. We're going to have it very—a very powerful statement.\nWe've arrested numerous people, as you know, for what took place outside of Washington. In addition, the FBI is investigating hundreds of people throughout the country for what they've done to monuments, statues, and even buildings.\nSo we have very strong laws already in the books, and we have a law that's 10 years. It's 10 years. That's a long time to have fun 1 night. I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don't even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is, when they knock down Grant—when they want to knock down Grant. But when they look at certain—now they're looking at Jesus Christ. They're looking at George Washington. They're looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. Not as long as I'm here.\nAs far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we're going to have a very strong Executive order, and it'll happen very quickly, before the end of the week.\nPoland-U.S. Relations\nI can say that President Duda is doing very well in Poland. He's doing a terrific job. The people of Poland think the world of him and, by the way, Mrs. Duda, who is a terrific woman, a terrific woman who we've gotten to know also through our various travels and meetings. But they think the world of him, and I don't think he needs my help.\nI'm honored that this is a day that's, I guess, just before your election. I'm honored. But he will do very well with or without us. He's going to have a great success, and Poland is going to continue on. They're doing incredibly well as a country.\nOkay, please.\n[President Duda spoke briefly in English to President Trump as follows.]\nThank you.\nThank you.\nWell, I think you can, and we also are working with Russia right now on an arms treaty, which is a very big thing—nuclear arms, specifically.\nBut we're working very much, and we're—I think I can say, Mike, we're doing very well on that. We're two countries that want to see it happen. And we're working on other things with Russia. We have a very good relationship. We have our Ambassador over there right now, who'll be attending certain festivities, and that's a good thing. And I think that's, frankly, a good thing for Poland also.\nLikewise, we're going to be having very important dignitaries at your parade. You're going to be having a very big event soon, and we're going to be—I guess, in August—and we're going to have people representing the United States at a very high level. And that's very important to us also.\nOkay? Please.\nThank you all very much. We will see you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-andrzej-duda-poland-1"}
{"Title": "Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News", "Date": "2020-07-09", "Text": "Well, thank you very much.\nAnd how good is Mark?\nHe's on fire.\nI'm Donald J. Trump, and I approve this message.\nWell, I agree with that 100 percent.\nAnd we need safety. We need security. We can't defund our police. And we can't abolish our police. They want to abolish our police.\nAnd as far as the surplus equipment, I have given out hundreds of millions of dollars. This is stuff that was sitting in storage houses all over the country. It wasn't even old, but it was never going to be used again. It was gathering dust. And I gave it out to all of our police forces all over the country, saved many, many police lives and many lives, I think, period.\nIt was really -- a lot of it was protective equipment. And I know that President Obama and Biden didn't want to give it out. They thought it was terrible to give it out. It made the police look too strong. And I gave it out, and I have been thanked by every police department.\nWell, first of all, New York City is not recognizable. Crime is way up. Shootings are way up. Murder is way up. It's just unbelievable.\nChicago -- what's going in Chicago -- and we're looking at it very seriously, because we're going to have to do something.\nWe have asked them. We're really supposed to be asked to come in and help the federal government. And we have the greatest people in the world, and we can solve it. But we are supposed to be asked. So, the mayor or the governor of Illinois should be asking. But they don't want to ask.\nAnd you look every weekend and every week in Chicago, it's just numbers that are not believable. Atlanta is starting to have some problems.\nSo, we are ready to act. And, at some point, we may have to act anyway. We may have to do it sooner, rather than later.\nA hundred percent. We were going in. We were going in very soon. We let them know that.\nAnd they, all of a sudden -- they didn't want that, so they went in before we got there. And -- but we were going and very shortly, very soon, and we would've taken the CHOP, I call it, CHOP. We would have taken it back very easily.\nBut they went in. And, frankly, the people just gave up. They were tired. They had it for a long period of time.\nBut because of the fact that we were going to go in -- now, if you look at Minneapolis, after four or five days of horror, we called them. We said, you got to get out the National Guard. We insisted that they do it.\nWhen the National Guard finally got out, they walked through it like a knife goes through butter. That was the end of their problem. That was it. It was a great job done by the National Guard.\nAnd, yes, we were all set to go into Seattle. Frankly, I looked forward to it.\nSo, first of all, I saw the interview.\nAnd he's a lovely man. I spoke to him at length, and with his friend, who is a great guy too.\nactually invited them down to the White House at some point, when they get -- when they get -- when they get adjusted, because it is so tough.\nI mean, what he is going through is so tough. And he was treated very badly. They didn't even tell him what had happened, when it had happened. Very sad thing.\nBut I did speak to him. And I had a great, but very sad conversation. And so, he will be coming down. When he's ready, he will be coming down to the White House.\nI will say, look, they have to be tough. They have to be smart. What's going on there -- and, you know, the Chicago police is terrific. The New York police, New York's finest, they are just not being allowed to do their job. They don't want to do anything, because they will end up -- they will end up with lots of bad things happening to them. They are not letting them do the job.\nAnd I dealt a lot with Mayor de Blasio. I was very nice to Mayor de Blasio. I got him ventilators when he needed them. I got him hospital help when he needed it. I got him everything he needed. I got him the gowns. I got him the masks. I got him everything, the shields. I got that man everything. I spoke to him many times.\nHe couldn't have been nicer. And then he throws a big Black Lives Matter sign right down in the middle of Fifth Avenue. And all merchants along Fifth Avenue are furious. They are furious. And the whole city is furious.\nThe city is a city that's enraged. And...\nEverything I did -- and I'm -- it's almost -- it was almost a test, Sean.\nBut I was so good to him and to Governor Cuomo, like nobody has ever been good. And all you end up doing out of that place is get prosecuted and have a lot of trouble.\nSo, New York is not the place that it was. Everyone's leaving. They're moving to Florida. They're moving to other places. It's very sad, actually, to see what happened.\nRight.\nWell, I don't think it's the age, because I was with Bernie Marcus. I think he's 91. He is so sharp. He's as sharp as ever.\nHe's great, the founder of Home Depot, one of the founders, great guy. And I deal with other people in their late 80s, early 90s, and they're 100 percent mentally so sharp. Sheldon Adelson is an example, and others, many others. I could -- and they -- they're mentally 100 percent.\nBut Joe is just -- look, let's face it, he's been taken over by the radical left. He has no clue what they are doing and what they're getting him into.\nThis is worse than Bernie Sanders at his -- at his best. And you look at the deal they made with Bernie Sanders now in the group. It's all crazy, radical left stuff. And Joe is never going to be able to fight it, even if he disagreed with it, which I actually don't think he does.\nI think they -- you know, there is an expression, an old expression, was used badly in old time ago in politics. I think they brainwashed him. They brainwashed him. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't know what he's doing.\nAnd our country will suffer. Our stock markets will crash. Bad things will happen. They will defund the police. They will abolish the police. It will be maybe a backlash, or maybe it'll just go to hell, like Venezuela.\nWell, the answer is yes, absolutely.\nBut he -- he meant the COVID tests, the COVID tests. He didn't mean cognitive. He meant COVID.\nWell, I know. But he didn't mean that, because you don't have those tests that often. He said, I take them all the time.\nAnd, no, he meant to COVID. But I think he was confused by the questions and the words and everything else. He didn't mean that, because he hasn't taken any cognitive test, because he couldn't pass one.\nI actually took one when I -- very recently, when I -- when I was -- the radical left were saying, is he all there? Is he all there? And I proved I was all there, because I got -- I aced it. I aced the test.\nAnd he should take the same exact test, a very standard test. I took it at Walter Reed Medical Center in front of doctors. And they were very surprised. They said, that's an unbelievable thing. Rarely does anybody do what you just did.\nBut he should take that same test.\nBut, no, he has been totally taken over, and I think it's because he doesn't understand what's going on. I watched him today. I watched him over the last couple of weeks. And I look forward to debating him, but it looks like he wants to try to get out of the debates.\nI think we are doing very well in the polls. I think, if you look at the different states, I think we are doing very well. We are rapidly rising.\nI was with the president of Mexico yesterday. We had an incredible day. We have tremendous Hispanic support. We have tremendous African American support. I think we have great support, period.\nYou look at the boats, you look at the bikers, you look at everything that's happening in our country, there is great spirit, spirit like nobody's ever seen before, actually. And there's no spirit for Joe.\nWell, first of all, the mortality rate -- and Dr. Fauci is a nice man, but he's made a lot of mistakes, like, you don't have to ban them coming in from very infected China. I did it anyway, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\nI banned Europe from coming in, when Italy and when France and Spain were having all the problems, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. A lot of people said, don't do it. They have been wrong about a lot of things, including face masks. Maybe they are wrong, maybe not. But a lot of them said, don't wear a mask, don't wear a mask. And now they are saying, wear a mask.\nSo, a lot of mistakes were made, a lot of mistakes.\nLet me just make one statement, though. We do testing like nobody's ever done testing. And when we test, the more you test, the more cases you find. Other countries, you know when they test? And I ask them all. They test when somebody's not feeling well or when somebody walks into a hospital. So they don't have tests.\nThey have tests that are very, very limited. We have these massive -- 40, 45 million people have been tested. It's a record. And our tests are the best.\nSo, we have cases all over the place. Most of those cases immediately get better. They get -- people -- they're young people. They have sniffles, and two days later, they are fine. And they are not sick to start off with. They are asymptomatic.\nA lot of things happen. And what we are doing is, with all of these tests that we are doing all over the country, test everybody, test, pull-up parking lots, everything else, what we have done is, we have created a tremendous number of cases.\nEverybody else -- can you imagine if China tested like we test? They don't. Can you imagine if other big countries, the bigger countries, tested like we -- or Germany. We have tested many, many, many times, even proportionately, the number of people that other countries have tested.\nBut I was with, as an example, a great gentleman yesterday, the president of Mexico. And they are having a hard time, especially in Mexico City. They test when somebody is sick or when somebody goes into the hospital. And that is a different way of doing it, and it's just fine.\nAnd we are testing and creating -- it's the greatest thing that ever happen for the opposite party, but we are doing something that nobody has ever done to the extent, and we are doing a great job.\nBut we have a mortality rate, think of this, that's tenfold better than any other. We -- what we are doing is incredible, if you look. You have heard the numbers, tenfold. We have fewer people dying. And our people have done an incredible job.\nAnd one other thing. We are very well on the way to a vaccine, very well on the way therapeutically, therapeutics. We're very well on the way. We have a lot of great things happening.\nWe already do. We do have some that are very effective, or at least effective. And a lot of very good things have happened, a lot of really good things. They're doing a great job.\nBut the testing is just showing up all these cases. And if you turn the news on, you will see it's always the word cases. They don't talk about death, because deaths are way down. They talk about cases, all the time, cases. And those cases get better.\nThey -- in most -- most cases, in almost -- I mean, literally, in most cases, they automatically cure. They automatically get better.\nRight.\nRight.\nWell, we do.\nAnd we have done a great job, in that we have created a supply chain that's incredible. On ventilators, we are making thousands a week. On PPE, we are doing great. We do.\nBut I think it's fine to wear a mask, if it makes you feel comfortable. I think, under certain conditions, like when you are going into a hospital -- I will be going to Walter Reed to see some of our great soldiers that have been injured, badly injured, and also see some of our COVID workers, the people that have done such a great job.\nAnd I expect to be wearing a mask when I go into Walter Reed. You're in a hospital setting. I think it's a very appropriate thing. I have no problem with a mask.\nI don't think you need one you're tested all the time, everybody around you is tested, you're quite a distance. You talk about social distancing. You're away.\nLike, I watched Biden walk onto a stage with his -- practically -- like, today, there was almost nobody in the room. He's making a speech. And they have these massive circles. And the circles are very far away from each other to start off with. And then they have just a few people in the audience.\nAnd he makes a speech. And he walks onto the stage wearing this massive mask. There's nobody on the stage. And then he takes it off. He likes to have it hang off usually the left ear. I think it makes him feel good, frankly, if you want to know the truth. And I guess that's OK.\nBut when there's nobody around, you don't really have to do that. But he feels it's good. And I'm OK with it, if he wants to do that. He's got the largest mask I think I have ever seen. It covers up a big proportion of his face.\nAnd I think he feels he looks good that way.\nYes, I think, if I'm in the right setting, if I'm with soldiers, people that -- I don't want to spread anything.\nAnd it's -- a lot of it is, it's you spreading, not them spreading.\nIt's you spreading. No, and I don't want to cause a problem for anybody. No, I have no problem with masks. But it's got to be done at the right time.\nNow, I'm usually fairly isolated, as the president, so I'm fairly isolated. Everybody's tested before they come in. They...\nNo, I know, but it's -- they do a great job. They really do a great job.\nNo, I have no problem with masks. That's up to you.\nThat's right.\nRight.\nWell, a ship ventilation system is very much -- they circularize. And they are very much under review, to be honest with you.\nBut we did a great job with the Comfort. We did a great job with the Mercy and the Comfort. In Los Angeles, we had a great ship, very -- a sister -- sister ship, a really terrific operation.\nBut when we moved it in, there was -- they didn't send us people. And then they said, could you convert it to COVID? Because it wasn't meant for that. It was meant for operations. But it wasn't getting used, and so the governor asked if we could convert it for COVID. And we did. And they didn't use it.\nAnd we took -- the Javits Center did a phenomenal job in record-setting time. A matter of days, we converted into a massive, like, 2,600 units, and they didn't use it, or very little did they use it.\nAnd I said, what are you doing with all of these requests, and then you're not using it? What's going on? And if they would have used that, instead of nursing homes, they wouldn't have lost thousands of people in the nursing homes. They could've put people in the Javits Center or they could have put them in the ship.\nBut they put them back in nursing homes. And they were badly infected, and then they ended up hitting the people that are most vulnerable, and thousands of people died.\nWell, first of all, I'm under tax audit, OK?\nSo, I mean, they treat -- the IRS treats me just like they used to treat the Tea Party, except worse. And I'm under tax audit. I have been for a long period of time. We made a deal a long time ago. And once I ran for politics, that deal was like -- we didn't make it.\nSo, I am under a continuing audit. And anybody that did that or showed that, before you have it finalized, but they treat -- they treat me horribly, the IRS, horribly. It's a disgrace, what's happened.\nWe had a deal done. In fact, it was -- I guess it was signed even. And once I ran or once I won, or somewhere back a long time ago, everything was like, well, let's start all over again. It's a disgrace.\nSo, I was disappointed. And, at the same time, it was -- because I think we -- a president should get protection from thousands of prosecutors out there, thousands all over the country. They could go after you. And you're supposed to be running the country.\nI will tell you, Justice Alito wrote a totally brilliant decision. He wrote something today that really got it.\nJustice Thomas, likewise, was great.\nThey were the two that came.\nSo, it was -- look, it basically sends it all back, and we start all over again. I guess that is what it means.\nWell, first of all, President Obama and Joe Biden spied on my campaign. They knew everything that was going on. They were in the rooms when everyone was talking about it. These people all worked for them. I know how the White House works, I guess I can say now, better than anybody.\nAnd they knew everything that was going on. They spied on my campaign. I said it a long time ago. Nobody believed me. And now it turns out to be fact. So, let's see what happens. But they were the head of it.\nAnd it was Comey and Brennan and everybody else, Clapper. And those guys all lied to Congress, and bad things happened, and Strzok and Page, the two lovers, and many other people, many other people. When you look at -- I could go down a list of lots of people.\nThey were spying on my campaign. It was totally illegal. If that were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years, and it would've started two years ago. It's a disgrace, what's going on. We caught them, 100 percent.\nAs far as General Flynn, he's a great hero. He's a great gentleman. What they are doing to that man, they have destroyed that man. But he will come back. He's going to come back.\nRoger Stone was treated very unfairly, unbelievably unfairly. And I watched that, and I thought it was incredible, the way that man was treated...\n... including with the jury forewoman, who was -- it was disgraceful.\nAnd the judge, the way she treated him, I think it was a disgrace that they didn't give him a retrial, Roger Stone.\nAnd Papadopoulos, I mean, you -- they have a tape of his conversation. If anything, he is like -- it was a perfect -- as I said about my conversation. I turned out to be right. It was a perfect conversation that Papadopoulos had. And they destroyed him too and put him in jail for two weeks.\nSo these people -- and Paul Manafort, what they did to that man is a disgrace.\nI am always thinking. I am always thinking.\nSo, you will be watching, like everybody else in this case. You will be watching.\nBut Roger Stone...\n... Papadopoulos, Manafort, what they did to that man, what they did to that man, putting him in solitary confinement.\nAl Capone, the great gangster, the ultimate gangster, was never in solitary confinement. You know, what they did to -- what they did to him was just incredible.\nAnd, you know, look, it's a very sad thing. Here's a group. We have them cold. They lied. They leaked. They did everything. We have them already. We could get -- they could get more evidence, it doesn't matter. They have them cold.\nI hope that they act. I hope that Lindsey Graham does something with the Judiciary Committee. We have all the evidence they need. Now, maybe they're getting new stuff. I let them handle that.\nBut the Judiciary Committee should act.\nAnd it's also -- like, people don't like to say, it President Obama.\nHe knew everything. He was probably in charge of it or was in charge of it. Joe Biden, you know, I don't know if he knows where he is, but he was there. He knew everything.\nThat's right. That's right.\nThat's right.\nAnd, by the way, Christopher Steele was just adjudged guilty in London...\n... or wherever on what he said about other people with his fake dossier, his phony, disgusting dossier. And he is a part of it too.\nThere are many people part of it that you didn't even mention. You don't have enough time. They have all been caught.\nNow let's see what happens. But they have all been caught. And they spied on the campaign. You could call it treason. You could call it many different things. But it's very serious.\nAnd, so far, nothing's happened...\n... because the other side is vicious. And I guess the Republicans, they are just not vicious. They're just not -- it's very sad to see.\nBut we have some great ones, though, I will tell you, when you see Jim Jordan, and you see Meadows, and you see Devin Nunes, and you see many of them, many of them, Lee Zeldin. And Kevin is fantastic, Kevin McCarthy. What a job he's doing.\nWe got some -- we have some great ones.\nBut they are straight players. They are very straight players. And the other side, they are not straight players. It's a disgrace, what's happening.\nAnd then you look at what's going on in Democrat-run cities, and how horrible it is.\nAnd the media is totally corrupt. When I say totally, largely. There are some very fine people I know in the media, some very honorable people. But, largely, it's corrupt, not even fake. It's corrupt.\nWell, first of all, I didn't know I was criticized for that answer, because it's a simple question.\nFirst of all, we're going to defeat the invisible enemy. And that's -- and we are well on our way, and, again, as I told you, the mortality rate is tenfold down.\nWe are going to rebuild the economy. We're going to bring back jobs from all of these foreign lands that have stolen our jobs on horrible trade deals. We are going to continue to make great trade deals. We're going to finish rebuilding our wall.\nWe're going to finish. We're going to have that. It's going to be almost complete by the end of this year. Shortly thereafter, it's finished. It's made a tremendous difference. You see, we're doing record numbers on the border. Very few people are able to get through.\nWe are rebuilding with our military. We have rebuilt the military, $2.5 trillion. We are fixing up the VA for our vets. What -- the job we have done there, between Choice and Accountability. We have Choice, where they have -- they can go out and get a doctor if they are sick.\nThey don't have to wait for five weeks, six weeks, two weeks. So we are doing great with the vets. And the vets are loving Trump.\nWe are protecting our Second Amendment, so important. We need more judges and more justices. You see that now with the Supreme Court more than ever. And the next president -- I have had two -- and the next president is going to be able to pick two or three or one or whatever, but a lot of justices.\nAnd that means everything, whether it's for life or other things. I mean, it means so much.\nBut protecting the Second Amendment, getting more judges, all of the things that we have done, nobody's done what this administration has done in the first three-and-a-half years. Nobody's even come close, when you look at everything that we are doing.\nNow what we're doing is working on lowering drug prices and knocking out special interests, because it's not easy. We're fighting for choice. We did it for the veterans. Now we are doing it for school too. We want choice in school, so a parent can take their child to a school of their choice.\nAnd that's happening, very good -- very, very well. And we have many things we are doing and many things that we have already completed. And you can't do more than what we have done. I think we have set records on every -- we actually set a record on judges.\nWe are going to be -- by the time of the end of this year, we will be up to almost 300 federal judges. And that's a record. That's incredible, including D.C.\nRight.\nYes.\nOK.\nWell, first of all, the border wall is doing incredibly well. We are moving along. And we are up to about 250 miles already. We will have -- by the end of the year, it will be close to finished. It might take an couple extra months, but we will have it. And it will be -- it's had a huge impact already, because we're about halfway finished.\nThe economy, it's one of the -- it's the thing. The economy is starting to really do great. We are going to have a great third quarter. We are going to have a great fourth quarter. And next year is going to the best, I think one of the best years that we have ever had.\nAnd that is the way it looks.\nYou know, the two jobs numbers that you mentioned, the 2.8 and the almost five million, those are record numbers in history.\nWe have never created jobs to the level that we have now. And before the China plague came in, the China virus, whatever you want to call it came in, we were beating everybody so badly, including China. We were beating everybody.\nChina had the worst year they had. The tariffs have hurt them. They had the worst year they have had. And we have taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. They had the worst year in 67 years, whereas we had the best year we have ever had.\nAnd then we got hit with the plague. But now we are rebuilding it. And it's going much faster than anybody thought possible, a V.\nWell, I like his voice being heard, but he's always going to be for us. I mean, he's going to be for us. And his wife is going to be for us.\nBut I like...\nI mean, he can't -- the problem, he's missed some states, little thing like that. He's missed a few states, like about 12.\nSo, you have to do that. But he's a very good guy. He is a person that I get along with very well. And, in the end, I think he would support us over anyone else. But, you know, if he does or not, look, we have to stop the radical left from taking over our country, ripping down our great heroes.\nThey are ripping down our heroes. When they take down those statues and those monuments, they're rip -- when they take down George Washington...\n... and they take down Abraham Lincoln, and Ulysses S. Grant, and when they take down these people, an abolitionist, people that -- think of it.\nAbolitionists are being -- because I think most of them don't even know what they are doing. But it's very destructive.\nAnd we are not going to be Venezuela.\nThank you very much, Sean. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-fox-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-07-14", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. Please. I hope it's not too hot. But it's pretty warm. Thank you.\nSo we've had a big day in the stock market. Things are coming back, and they're coming back very rapidly—a lot sooner than people thought. People are feeling good about our country. People are feeling good about therapeutics and possible vaccines. But we're going to go over quite a bit, and maybe at the end, we'll take some questions if we have time, if it's not too hot.\nToday I signed legislation and an Executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which I signed this afternoon, passed unanimously through Congress. This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong's freedom. We've all watched what happened. Not a good situation. Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away. And with it, goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets.\nA lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect. And we're going to do a lot more business because of it, because we just lost one competitor. That's the way it is. We lost a very, very serious competitor, a competitor that we incentivized to take a lot of business and do well. And we gave them a lot of business by doing what we did. We gave them things that nobody else had the right to do, and that gave them a big edge over other markets. And because of that edge, they've done really historic business, tremendous business—far bigger than anybody would have thought, years ago, when we did this gift. We—it was really a gift to freedom.\nToday I also signed an Executive order ending U.S. preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China: no special privileges, no special economic treatment, and no export of sensitive technologies.\nIn addition to that, as you know, we're placing massive tariffs and have placed very large tariffs on China, first time that's ever happened to China. Billions of dollars have been paid to the United States, of which I've given quite a bit to the farmers and ranchers for our country because they were targeted. And that's been going on for 3 years. It's the first time anybody's ever done anything like that.\nAnd prior to the plague pouring in from China, they were having the worst year, as you know, in 67 years. And I don't want them to have a bad year; I want them to have a good year, but they were taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, and that's stopping.\nBut then, they—then the virus came in, and the world is a different place. But we're now getting back, and one of the reasons the market is doing so—it's almost at the point that it was at prior to the plague. Almost. And we're getting very close. It's a great thing. It's an amazing thing, what our people have done and what they've endured.\nNo administration has been tougher on China than this administration. We imposed historic tariffs. We stood up to China's intellectual property theft, at a level that nobody has ever come close. We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries—many countries—and I did this myself, for the most part—not to use Huawei, because we think it's an unsafe security risk. It's a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can't use it. Just today I believe that U.K. announced that they're not going to be using it. And that was up in the air for a long time, but they've decided. And you look at Italy; you look at many other countries.\nWe withdrew from the Chinese-dominated WHO, and we fully rebuilt the United States military. The WHO—World Health Organization—we were paying close to $500 million a year. China was paying $39 million a year. And China had too much say. They worked it very hard, which is a bad thing done by our past administrations. But we were tough, and we were saying—I was asking—I said, \"Why are we paying so much more than China?\" China has 1.4 billion people; we have 325—probably 325 million, approximately. Nobody can give the exact count. We're trying to get an exact count. But you have, over the years, many illegals who have come into the country, so it depends on how you want to count it. But you could say 325 to 350 million people, as opposed to 1.4 billion people.\nAnd the World Trade—World Trade is terrible. That deal is terrible. And the World Health is a terrible deal. We've been very tough on the World Trade Organization, and we've been, I guess, as tough as you can get on World Health. We withdrew our money. We told them we're getting out. It doesn't mean that someday we won't go back in. Maybe we will, when it's correctly run. But they made a lot of bad predictions, and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it. And they turned out to be wrong, and they were really a puppet of China.\nAnd make no mistake: We hold China fully responsible for concealing the virus and unleashing it upon the world. They could have stopped it. They should have stopped it. It would have been very easy to do at the source when it happened.\nIn contrast, Joe Biden's entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party and to the calamity of errors that they've made. They made so many errors. And it's been devastating for the American worker. China has taken out hundreds of billions of dollars a year from our country. And we rebuilt China. I give them all the credit in the world. I don't give the credit for the people that used to stand here, because they allowed this to happen where hundreds of billions of dollars were taken out of the United States Treasury in order to rebuild China.\nThere's no company and no country in the world—no country in the world has ever ripped off the United States like the incredible job that they did on this country and the people that ran it. Possibly, it's one of the reasons—certainly, it's one of the very big reasons—trade and things related to trade—that I got elected in the first place. I've been talking about it for a long time, along with many other subjects, frankly.\nJoe Biden supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest geopolitical and economic disasters in world history. If you look at China, you look at the moment they joined the World Trade, they were flatlining for years and years and years and decades. And then, all of a sudden, they joined the World Trade Organization, and they went like a rocket ship. They were given all sorts of advantages. They were considered a developing country. As a developing country, they got tremendous advantages over the United States and other countries. And they took advantage of those advantages and then some.\nBiden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn't have it. Never did. Probably never even asked for it, because they didn't know what they were doing.\nAs Vice President, Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris climate accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. It would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity. Yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party. They took all of the advantage away from us. They took everything away. They don't have oil. We would have had to close up tremendous amounts of our energy to qualify, eventually, not too far into the future. We would've had to do things that would have been unbelievably destructive to our country, including the possible closing of 25 percent of our businesses. Think of that. And it was going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of being involved in the Paris climate accord.\nAnd you just have to look at what took place this year in Paris and France, where money was being sent to countries all over the world, and the people of France didn't want to take it, and they didn't, and they did a lot of rioting. They had their taxes raised. We would have had to raise our taxes. And it was a disaster. I've been given a lot of credit for what I did there. It took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice—the Paris climate accord—but it wasn't good for us at all.\nAmerica lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was Vice President. Think of that: 10,000 factories. He wrote something today, and he made a statement today that I wrote down. It's pretty accurate.\nSo Biden was here for 47 years. Eight years—the last 8 years, not long ago—as Vice President, he said, \"One in 5 miles of our highways are still in poor condition.\" Well, we're doing a good job on highways, but why didn't he fix them 3 years ago? Why didn't he fix them?\n\"Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair and on the verge of collapse.\" Well, it's probably not a right number, but we have bridges that should have been fixed. Why didn't he fix them? He was there for 8 years with President Obama. Why didn't they fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges. This is what he wrote: \"High-speed broadband. We want high-speed broadband.\" Well why didn't he get it? Three years ago, it's not a long time.\nAnd he didn't do any of the things, but now he says he's going to be President, and, as President, he's going to do all the things that he didn't do. He never did anything, except make very bad decisions, especially on foreign policy.\nSo Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities, and steal our most precious secrets. And I've stopped it largely, but I've stopped it. And it wasn't easy, because you talk about a certain power of the telephone and the calls, where they would call and say, \"No, we don't want to do that.\" And other countries would call on behalf of China. But I did it. I did what has to be done. And you just take a look at what's gone on. And take a look at the kind of—at the numbers where they devalued their currency in order to pay the tariffs.\nNow the Democrat Party is calling for defunding of our military. Think of that: defunding. They want to defund our military when China is building a massive military. They're building a massive military, and Biden wants to defund our military. And the world needs American strength right now more than ever, and we've got it.\nWe've got now, soon—as it—all this equipment comes in, all made in the U.S.A.—we've got the newest, most incredible weapons anywhere in the world. We have the best tanks, the best ships, the best missiles, rockets. We have the best of everything. We have the best fighter jets—the F-35, the F-18. All of these assets are being built. Tankers—incredible tankers. Bombers. Hope we don't have to use them, but we have the most incredible military.\nWhen I came in, the military was totally depleted. It was at a level that was just absolutely incredible. And you know the statements. I made the statements before I told you what generals told me about our military. And I'll make them again. If somebody needs them, we'll give them to you. Very well documented. As Vice President, Biden opposed tariffs, and he was standing up for China. He didn't want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China, even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. \"Xenophobic,\" he called me. \"Xenophobic.\" A month later, he admitted I was right.\nWe would have had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China. But we stopped it; we did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing on the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later and even later than that and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake.\nWe would have lost—in fact, Dr. Fauci said you would have lost thousands of additional people if President Trump had to do that. And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn't want to do it. They thought it was a mistake. And then, I did Europe when I started seeing what was going on in Italy and Spain and France and other countries in Europe. I did a ban on people coming in from Europe. That would have been disastrous for our country also.\nAnd we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives by closing—by closing up, we saved millions, potentially millions of lives. Could be—a number that we're actually working on—but it could be 2 to 3 million lives. So we're at 135,000, which is terrible; one is too much. But we would have had millions of people dead from this curse that came at us.\nBut we did what we had to do, and now we'll put out the flames as it happens. We have to get the schools open. We have to get everything open. A lot of people don't want to do that for political reasons, not for other reasons.\nBut if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost. And if you look at the job he did on swine flu—I looked at a poll—they have polls on everything nowadays—and he—they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu, H1N1. He calls it \"N1H1.\" H1N1. He got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped, very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said, \"Stop.\"\nAnd frankly, if we didn't test, you wouldn't have all the headlines, because we're showing cases. And we have just about the lowest mortality rate. But if we did—think of this: If we didn't do testing—instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases. If we did another—you cut that in half, we would have, yet again, half of that.\nBut the headlines are always: \"Testing.\" Now, the testing is a good thing, but at the same time, it's fodder for the fake news to report cases. So we're doing 40 million-plus, going to be very close to 45 million people. And when I turn on the news, I see, \"cases, cases, cases.\" They don't talk about deaths being cut down to a level that—actually, \"tenfold,\" they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets—\"tenfold.\" Cut tenfold. Yes, but they don't talk about that; they talk about cases. And the cases are created because of the fact that we do tremendous testing. We have the best testing in the world.\nWe now make ventilators for the world. We had very few ventilators. There wasn't one person in any hospital anywhere in this country that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. And that was because we mobilized to a level—using the purchasing act, in some cases—we mobilized to a level that nobody thought possible.\nNothing has happened like that since World War II. Our Task Force has done a great job. Mike Pence worked so hard and gets so little credit. Sad to see that, actually. But he works so hard, and gets so little credit. The Governors would tell us—we'd be on the phone with 50 different Governors; they'd all tell us what a great job—\"Great job.\" And then, they'll go to the media and say, \"Well, they didn't do such a good job.\" Well, we did a great job.\nWe made a lot of Governors look fantastic. We did in New York—what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things: 2,800 beds in Javits Center, but the Governor used very few of them, unfortunately. Then, we moved in our great hospital ships, one of our two great. We moved one also to Los Angeles.\nAnd we could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used it for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected, where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the Governor. And it's a very sad thing to see and very sad to watch and very sad to look at those statistics.\nBut we have an incredible Javits Center that we built with thousands of beds. I think it was 2,800, all ready to go. And they could have sent people there, or they could have sent senior citizens there instead of sending them into the nursing homes. And after all of that work and getting it done, the Army Corps of Engineers—I mean, the job they did was incredible. They built it in a matter of days.\nWhen it was all completed—FEMA, everybody was there—doctors. We ended up getting doctors. They said, \"We can't man it.\" I said, \"So we'll man it and woman it.\" And that's what we did. We brought in doctors, nurses, everything. We're all set. We said, \"Where are the people?\" They didn't send the people. Very few people came in. They could have sent them into the Javits Center. They could have sent them to the hospital ship, which was virtually unused, but we were there.\nBy contrast, my administration acted very early to ban travel from China, from Europe, saving all of these lives. Incredible. And I want everyone to know, I want every citizen know that we're using the full power of the Federal Government to fight the China virus and to keep our people safe.\nThrough Operation Warp Speed, we will deliver a vaccine in record-breaking time. We're doing very well on the vaccines. We have many, many different vaccines being studied right now, many of which are looking really good. And we're ready to distribute the vaccine when we get it. We're all set. Taking a risk—an economic risk—of preparing for delivery, because we feel very certain it's going to be there. But logistically, we have our military ready to go. We have generals that that's all they do is distribute things, and they're going to be distributing, hopefully, a vaccine or a therapeutic, and it's coming out really well. And I think you're going to have some good news very, very quickly having to do with the vaccines.\nWe're also working with many other countries on the vaccine. Many countries are working with us. We're unleashing our Nation's scientific genius to kill the virus.\nJoe Biden didn't just side with China on the virus—he did; he called me, again, \"xenophobic.\" That's what he said. You all heard it many times. He described the rise of China as, quote, \"a very positive development.\" It's not a positive development, not for us, it's not. He said that the idea that China is our competition is \"really bizarre.\" He's really bizarre.\nHe said China is \"not a problem.\" No, nobody's ripped us off more than China over the last 25, 30 years. Nobody close. And he says China is \"not a problem.\" Now he takes it all back now. Now he wants to be Mr. Tough Guy. But for years—47 years—he never came out against China, never said anything bad. Just the opposite.\nHis son walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest, where he'll make hundreds of thousands of dollars—maybe millions of dollars a year. Walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street—maybe the biggest—\"Is that possible?\" He said, \"No.\" He's never seen it. They don't do that.\nBut Hunter—where's Hunter? Where is Hunter, by the way? Hunter Biden walked out with $1.5 billion. In Ukraine, he got $83,000 a month and, I guess, an up-front payment of $3 million. So he went from not having a job to getting $83,000 a month, with a lot of money paid up front to work for Burisma. And you all know about Burisma, but nothing happens. Nobody cares. And he was unemployed, as you know. He was unfortunately forced to leave the military. He was forced to leave. Didn't have a job, and all of a sudden, he's making a fortune. But nobody talks about that.\nIndeed, Biden expressed more fawning praise about China on an ordinary day than about America on the Fourth of July. The last Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States and said we had, quote, \"never lived up to\" the ideals of our fathers, our forefathers, or our Founding Fathers—those founding ideals. And yet he enthusiastically stated that China is a \"great nation\" and we should hope for its \"continued expansion.\"\nWell, we all wish well to China, but what China has unleashed on the world, it's hard to even fathom. I see people now, friends of mine, they walk up, they want to say hello, and they have to keep their distance, and they're all covered up, like you're all covered up, with facemasks. It's a different world, but we're coming out on top.\nBiden sides with China over America time and time again. And he said, on the Fourth of July, \"American history is no fairy tale\" and yet blindly celebrates China, saying, \"few . . . nations in history have come so far, so fast.\" He's so proud of them. He's so proud of them.\nNow Joe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy, totally demolish it.\nSo we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, greatest in the history of the world. That was a few months ago. Best unemployment numbers ever. Best for African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. Best for women. Best for everybody. Best for young people that didn't have a high school diploma, didn't have a college diploma. If they had a diploma, they were really in good shape. We built the greatest ever stock market, highest ever in history. We had 143 days of alltime stock market highs in just less than 3½ years.\nAnd we had to close it down—because we did the right thing by doing that. As I said, we saved millions of lives. But China was saying, \"This is incredible what's going on.\" China was, for the first time, respecting the United States. And now they want to do something that's much different: Joe Biden.\nSo I've watched this, and I've watched it with great interest. We're building our economy again. I guess the stock market went up almost 500 points today or something thereabouts. You'll check. But it was up a lot when I left. And our economy is coming back. We're almost at a level where—even though it's long before the very important—maybe the most important ever—election of November 3. But long before that—but we're close to record stock markets again. And NASDAQ hit an alltime high for the 16th time. Think of that: for the 16th time—over the last month or so, for the 16th time. So one of our markets already hit an alltime high.\nToday Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said that the core of his economic agenda is a hard-left crusade against American energy. He wants to kill American energy. He wants to reenter the unfair, one-sided Paris climate accord—which will destroy us—at the expense of many other nations who benefit. It was actually drawn, in my opinion, to take advantage of the United States, just like so many other deals that are done to take advantage of the fools running the United States. But this would do nothing for the environment, but would cripple American industry while greatly helping China.\nHe wants to impose massive energy taxes and job-crushing mandates to eliminate carbon from the United States economy—let him define the word \"carbon,\" because he won't be able to—obliterating American oil, clean coal, natural gas, and the natural energy resources that supply countless American jobs.\nJoe Biden put A.O.C., a young woman not talented, in many ways, in charge of his energy plan and the environment. Essentially, her and Bernie Sanders—who ran a lot of times for President, never made it. Good base, but that's about it. In other words, he wants to impose the Green New Deal on our country.\nWhen I first saw the Green New Deal, I thought it was a joke. I said, \"This will never go anywhere.\" Now they're trying to impose it. This will destroy our country and make us noncompetitive with other countries.\nDon't forget we're in competition with China and with many other countries throughout the world. We're in tremendous economic competition, including Europe, which has never treated us well. The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States. They formed, and they take advantage of the United States. And I know that, and they know I know that, but other Presidents had no idea.\nLast week, Joe Biden released his unity platform, developed with Socialist Bernie Sanders, describing what he would do if elected President. The Biden-Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee, by far, in American history. I think it's worse than, actually, Bernie's platform; it's gone so far right. And he's doing that because he's begging for their vote.\nBut one of the things I just asked my people to do is just draw up for me, just quickly, some of the things that we've been hearing about over the last couple of weeks. And these are actual key elements of the Biden-Sanders unity platform: Abolish immigration detention. No more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention.\nStop all deportation. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we've taken out of our country by the thousands—brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala—can't do that anymore—El Salvador. Can't do that anymore. Stop all deportations. So, in other words, we'll take all of these people—many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things.\nEnd prosecution of illegal border crossers. Oh, okay, they come in illegally, and we have to stop the whole process. Support the deadly sanctuary cities where many of these people are protected better than the American citizen is protected.\nIncentivize illegal-alien child smuggling. Give it an incentive. Because if you look at what they're saying, that's exactly what they do: incentivize illegal-alien child smuggling. They're incentivized by what this plan calls for.\nExpand asylum for all new illegal aliens. How about that one? All new illegal aliens, expand asylum. Cancel all asylum cooperation agreements in the Western Hemisphere. Well, we have agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, with El Salvador. We have great agreements, where, when Biden and Obama used to bring killers out, they would say: \"Don't bring them back to our country. We don't want them.\" \"Well, we have to.\" We don't want them; they wouldn't take them. Now, with us, they take them. Someday, I'll tell you why. Someday, I'll tell you why. But they take them, and they take them very gladly.\nThey used to bring them out, and they wouldn't even let the airplanes land if they brought them back by airplanes. They wouldn't let the buses into their country. They said, \"We don't want them.\" I said, \"No, but they entered our country illegally.\" And they're murderers; they're killers, in some cases. And they said, \"Nope, we don't want them.\" They'd turn the bus around, they'd turn the plane around, and they'd land in the United States, and who knows what happened to them, but it wasn't good.\nTaxpayer-funded lawyers will be given to all illegal aliens. So we're going to pay now for the lawyers' lobby. And we're going to give all illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers. How does that sound? Pretty good? In other words: Come in here illegally. We're going to give you a free legal advice. We'll take you up to the Supreme Court as much as possible.\nAbolish immigration enforcement against illegal workers. Think of that: Abolish immigration enforcement. They're going to abolish immigration enforcement. Well, basically, as you know, what they're going to do is, they're going to rip down the wall. They're taking it down. They want to take down the wall, which we fought hard for: up to 259 miles right now of great, powerful wall that's really working, because, if you look at the numbers, in addition to the fact that Mexico, for various reasons, has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border to keep people out of our country—and I appreciate it.\nWe had a great meeting last week with the President of Mexico. Great guy. Friend of mine—become a friend of mine. A lot of people thought that couldn't happen, because we're very opposite, in terms of our views, maybe even in terms of our temperament. But he is a great guy, and he's a friend of mine, and they've been terrific. Mexico has been terrific. Twenty-seven thousand soldiers on our border, Mexican soldiers. And we have great, great numbers.\nWe got rid of so many different things: Catch-and-release is gone. So many different things have taken place. We used to catch them, take their name, and release them into our country. We don't do that anymore. We now release them back where they came from. Sometimes, we'll bring them back to their country.\nGrant work permits for illegal aliens. So if you come in illegally, you get a work permit. People that live here don't get work permits, in many cases. Provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for illegal aliens and new immigrants. So we want to provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for people that come into our country illegally, illegal immigrants. They want government health care for all illegal aliens.\nThis is part of their plan. I'm not making this up. This is all down in their plan from last week. And this is good, compared to what I heard today.\nFederal student aid and free community college for illegal aliens. What do you think about that? Federal student aid and free community college. We're going to have every person in the world pouring into our country from all over the world.\nAnd by the way, the wall was so timely, because it stopped people coming in from heavily infected areas of Mexico. If we had that, we would be in trouble like you wouldn't believe. You wouldn't believe.\nAnd remember, cases is different than deaths. And cases we give you, because our testing is the best in the world. And by the way, by far, the most: 45 million. Find out which country tested 45 million people. If China, if Russia, if India tested 45 million people or if they did tests like we did, check out how many cases they'd have.\nBut it's still—we've done a great job; get no credit for it. And I don't want the credit. I want the people that have done this great job—the people that have done such an incredible job on building the ventilators and doing the testing and building a testing platform that's been amazing. We have many platforms. Many companies have come up with different forms of tests. When we started, there was no such thing. Sign new immigrants up for welfare immediately. This is Joe Biden. So they walk off, and they come in, and they put a foot into our land, and we sign up new immigrants up for welfare. We sign them up immediately. They get welfare benefits. United States citizens don't get what they're looking to give illegal immigrants. Think of that: sign up—it's hard to believe I'm even reading that—new immigrants for welfare immediately. Not to mention the cost of this, which is incalculable. The cost of this is so crazy.\nEnd requirement for immigrants' self-sufficiency and maximize their welfare. Now, this is us writing this. Who's not coming to the United States? Every person from South America is going to pour in, and every person from other countries, they're going to be pouring in. End requirement—think of that—for immigrant self-sufficiency and, remember, to maximize welfare. So we're giving them maximum.\nThen, we have massively expand immigration during a global pandemic, taking jobs from unemployed Americans.\nEnd all travel bans, including from jihadist regions. So now we have travel bans; a lot of you said I didn't get the travel ban, and you were wrong. We got the travel ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit, we lost again in the Ninth Circuit, and then we won in the Supreme Court. We have a very strong travel ban. And we don't want people that are going to come in and blow up our cities, do things. And frankly, with the liberal Democrats running the cities that we do have, where they do have problems, maybe they wouldn't mind. But I would mind, and the people of this country mind.\nSo listen to this: End all travel bans. He's talking about the ban that I won that everybody said I didn't win. They said I didn't win because in the lower court we lost. Then, we lost in the appellate division, and then we won in the Supreme Court. So they said, \"He lost.\" And they're right, at the lower level. But, in the meantime, we won in the Supreme Court. So it's in effect, but they didn't say that. They said, \"He lost,\" which again, is fake news, but that's the way they do it.\nSo end all travel bans, including from jihadist regions. They specified that.\nGrant mass amnesty. Everybody gets amnesty. Mass amnesty. Think of that. And this says: Create a roadmap to citizenship for massive, massive numbers.\nAnd we're not talking about DACA, because I'm going to take care of DACA, much better than the Democrats did. The Democrats had their chance, and they blew it. But we're going to take care of DACA, because I'm going to be doing, in the not-too-distant future, pretty soon, I'm going to be signing a new immigration action, very, very big merit-based immigration action that, based on the DACA decision, I'll be able to do.\nVastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. So they want a lot of people come in with low skills; I like merit. Think of that: Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. These are the things that are in the plan. This is Biden. Biden has gone radical left.\nIncrease refugee admissions by 700 percent. Huh. That's a lot: by 700 percent. Nobody has ever heard of such a thing. Increase refugee admissions by 700 percent.\nAbolish law enforcement as we know it. I think the police do an incredible job in this country. And you're going to have a rogue, terrible cop, on occasion, like you do in any industry, in any business, in any profession. But I think they do an incredible job. Abolish law enforcement as we know it.\nEnd cash bail. No bail. Just, we let you right out. Look at what's happened to New York: Crime is up, shootings are up at numbers that nobody's ever seen before. Look at Chicago. What a disaster. And we're waiting for them to call us, because we're all set to go. We have the FBI. We have Homeland Security. We have everybody ready to go. We have the National Guard. They're all ready to go. End cash bail, releasing dangerous criminals onto our streets. Cash bail. New York just did that. Other places have done it. They haven't turned out to good.\nAbolish completely the death penalty. And I know there's a lot of debate on the death penalty, and there has been for a long time, but sometimes, you use the death penalty, depending on the crime. You know what happened today with regard to the death penalty.\nAppoint social justice prosecutors in order to free violent criminals. So they want to appoint social justice prosecutors to free violent criminals.\nEnd mandatory minimums. And that's by empowering judges to determine appropriate sentences by fighting to repeal mandatory minimums at the Federal level and give States incentives to repeal their mandatory minimums.\nWe could go on for days. Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They now want to abolish—they want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess. Incentivize jail and prison closures as populations decline.\nEnsure the resources saved are invested directly into those communities. So they want to close them, rather than have them for some very bad people, people that are not going to behave when they get out. You see that in New York; they allowed a lot of criminals out, and those criminals are causing havoc. And then, they got rid of their incredible and legendary crime squad. And bad things are happening in New York. Bad things are happening. I love New York. I hate to see what's going on.\nEnd solitary confinement. Free Federal housing for former inmates. So Federal housing now can go to inmates—former inmates.\nRejoin Paris climate accord, and seek an even higher level of restrictions. Oh, I didn't notice that. Oh, I see. So they want to rejoin the Paris climate accord, and they want to seek an even higher level of restraint. In other words, make it worse than it was.\nMandate net-zero carbon emissions for homes, offices, and all new buildings by 2030. That basically means no windows, no nothing. It's very hard to do. I tell people when they want to go into some of these buildings: \"How are your eyes? Because they won't be good in 5 years. And I hope you don't mind cold office space in the winter and warm office space in the summer, because your air conditioning is not the same as the good old days.\"\nMandate zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. Zero. We're talking about zero. Nothing can go in the air. Mandate net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And I believe he's changing that. He's bringing it down. He wants no petroleum product. He wants no oil or gas. I don't think Texas is going to do too well. They're going to get rid of about 7 million jobs if you go by the Biden plan. I don't think that Oklahoma, North Dakota, Pennsylvania are going to be too happy with that—and many other States—Ohio.\nMandate all 500,000 school buses and all 3 million Government vehicles be changed to zero-emission vehicles within 5 years. I've heard it worse than that. Install 500,000 taxpayer-funded charging stations nationwide.\nHere's a bad one, really bad one: End school choice. There is nothing that the African American community wants more than school choice. And mothers and fathers are going to be very happy to see him be defeated just on that alone: End school choice. So Joe Biden wants to end school choice.\nEnd tax credit scholarships serving disadvantaged students in 26 States. Oppose 14 million Americans with education savings accounts and get rid of school choice, having to do with school choice. Eliminate school choice in Washington, DC. You know what they've done in Washington. They have some incredible example right here. Example—I know of one example. I think they have a number of them, but one is incredible.\nAbolish all charter schools. Charter schools are doing great. Ban funding for charter schools in poor neighborhoods. \"We don't want charter schools in poor neighborhoods.\" Well, that's not fair. Abolish educational standards.\nAbolish—in the suburbs, you're going to abolish the suburbs with this. Enforce Obama-Biden's radical AFFH—that's the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of Federal affordable housing funds unless they change their zoning laws to fit the Federal Government's demands. So what you have—I mean, I've been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want low-income housing built in a neighborhood.\nWell, I'm ending that rule. I'm taking it out, so—I had spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We're going to be taking it out. I've watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs—in the suburbs.\nMothers aren't happy about that. Fathers aren't happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house, and now they're going to watch the housing values drop like a rock, and that has happened. It dropped like a rock. So we're not going to do that; we're going to do the exact opposite.\nProbably, there has never been a time—and this is just a few—this is—it's much worse than that. We did this very quickly. It's probably never been a time when candidates are so different. We want law and order; they don't want law and order. We want strong, closed borders with people able to come in through merit, through a legal process; they don't want to have any borders at all.\nThey're going to rip down the wall. It was hard to get that built. And now it's almost completed. It'll be completed by a little after the end of the year, and they want to rip it down. And it's had such an impact. It's incredible. It stops trafficking—human trafficking—of women and children, but women, mostly.\nHuman trafficking: one of the worst things ever, all at a level that has never been at because of the internet. You wouldn't think—you think of it as an ancient statement. You wouldn't think that's possible today, but it's human trafficking of women and children. And they want to let that go and continue.\nThe wall has stopped it so much because they will go over to a section where there aren't people—not an entry point—and they'll make a left into the United States. And they're on their way. They can't do that anymore. We have a 30-foot wall that goes 6 feet into the ground. It stops a lot of the tunneling, because they're pretty good at tunnels. But we watch the tunnels, and we have equipment for that. But you can't make a left anymore and come into the United States loaded up with human traffic.\nSo they want to take down the wall. They want to have open borders. Think of open borders today though, with the pandemic. I mean, the timing is sort of interesting, but—with the pandemic.\nSo there's never been a time when two candidates were so different. I mean, I've seen races where it's like the same exact platforms. I'm even talking about essentially Democrat, Republican. There's not that much difference. There's a little difference, but there's not much. You choose one because you like the way they look, you like the way they sound, you like the way they talk. You like something about one, and you don't like the other. But there's—you know, there's never been a difference.\nHere's one of the greatest difference—this is without question the single biggest difference: If you want law and order—for instance, I enacted recently, when I saw what was going on with Federal monuments—we don't have the right to do States, although we're going—we're trying to find it. But with the monuments, where they wanted to rip down Andrew Jackson, they wanted to rip down George Washington. They were actually heading over to the Jefferson Memorial, if you can believe that. But this has been going on, and I found an act that we've used. And we have many, many people in jail right now—many, many people in jail, all over the country—because they tried to destroy or, in some cases, got it down, a Federal statue or monument.\nWe haven't had anybody making a move since I enacted this. I signed an Executive order a couple of weeks ago, and it says very simply, \"Ten years in jail.\" You do it, 10 years in jail. The amazing part is we're able to catch everybody because, thanks to all of you on television—we appreciate it—but we have their pictures. We have the man standing on Andrew Jackson's horse. We have the man standing by General George Washington. We have everybody standing—you know, they were going to go for the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln, standing with a young man who was being freed. And we said: \"We're going to do something. We can't let this happen.\"\nNow, it could be removed at some point. You go through a process, a legal process, go through Congress, whatever. I understand that. At the same time, some people like these statues and monuments. But it can be removed, but you have to go through a legal process.\nSo they were going to have 20- to 25,000 people that night; nobody showed up. Nobody. You know that, because you were disappointed to see that. The next night, I believe, 22 people showed up. They said, \"We're going to make it Friday night instead,\" and 22 people showed up. Four were actually arrested because we have pictures of them knocking down other statues. So they're in jail now.\nSo there has never been an election where we've had this kind of difference. We want strong borders. Without borders—you've heard me say it 1,000 times—without borders, you don't have a country. They don't want to have borders; they want to have open borders. It's radical left, and it will destroy our country.\nTwenty years ago, Venezuela was a very rich country—one of the richest, one of the richest anywhere. Per capita, one of the richest. Tremendous oil reserves. Now they don't have water. They don't have food. They don't have medicine. We do everything we can to take care of the people, but they have nothing. And that's exactly the ideology that you have going over here. If I wasn't there to stop it, if I wasn't here to say, \"No way, that's not going to happen,\" we'd be in some mess. We'd be in some mess.\nAnd Pelosi and Schumer and Bernie and Joe, they'll never stop it. They don't have the power, the strength to stop it. It's beyond them. But we do.\nSo there's never been a time like this, where you've had an election of people so different.\nOkay, a couple of questions. Yes, please, go ahead.\nNo, I don't. I think we have a really good poll numbers. They're not suppression polls; they're real polls. You look at the Intracostal in Florida. You look at the lakes. You see thousands of boats with Trump signs, American signs. You've got the Trump-Pence sign all over. You look at what's going on. You look at bikers, for miles and miles, riding up highways proudly with their signs.\nI have—look, we won a race where it was the same thing: 2016. We had polls that were fake. They turned out to be fake. Not all—a couple of them got it right. Three of them, to be exact. Three of them. One of them was unsuspecting, but they got it right. They were very proud of it.\nBut we had, in 2016, something even more so, but we got in, and we had 306 to, I guess, 223, which was a tremendous margin of difference. You remember, they all said, \"He cannot get to 270.\"\nI went to Maine a number of times, where we just freed up lobster fishing and fishing. Just—they took away 5,000 square miles from Maine. I just opened it up. And I just got rid of tariffs in China. And we're working on European Union, which charge our fishermen tariffs. And I said, \"You're not going to do that.\" So we freed it up for Maine.\nBut if you take a look, we went up there recently. There were crowds. Thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for—we're making swabs. A beautiful, big, new factory, making swabs.\nI think that the enthusiasm now is greater—and maybe far greater—than it was in 2016. I think a lot of people don't want to talk about it. I think they're not going to say: \"Hey, I'm for Trump. I'm for Trump.\" They don't want to go through the process. And I fully understand that, because the process is not fair. The media doesn't treat us fairly. They never have, and perhaps they never will. But maybe they will when we turn this around for a second time. And it's going to happen very quickly. When we turn it around for a second time, maybe they will.\nI think we're doing very well in the polls. And I think you have a silent majority the likes of which this country has never seen before. This is a very important election. We've done a great job. We had to turn it off, as I said. Turn it off. And now we've started it again.\nAs you know, they announced 2 weeks ago, record job numbers: almost 5 million people. And that beat the last month, which was also a record: 2.8 million people. Nobody's ever done what we've done, and now we're doing it twice.\nAnd I think by election day, you're going to see some incredible numbers. The third quarter is going to be really good. Fourth quarter is going to be great. But next year is going to be one of the best economic years. So hopefully, I'll be able to be the President where we say, \"Look at the great job I did.\"\nI think, great. I think we have a great chance. I think we're going to have a lot of people show up. I'm very worried about mail-in voting, because I think it's subject to tremendous fraud and being rigged. You see that Paterson, New Jersey, where—I believe it was 20 percent of the vote was fraudulent. It was—all sorts of things happened. I understand a mailman was recently indicted someplace for playing games with the mail-in ballots.\nYou'll have tremendous fraud if you do these mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are okay, because absentee ballots—you have to get applications. You have to go through a process. If I'm here and I vote in Florida, you get an absentee ballot, but you have to go through a process. Absentee ballots are great.\nBut mail-in voting—where a Governor mails millions of ballots to people all over the State—California—millions and millions of ballots, as an example—and then they come back; they don't come back. Who got them? Did you forget to send them to a Republican area or a Democrat area, I guess you could say?\nBut if you take a look at all of the unbelievable fraud that's been involved with mail-in voting over the last—even a short period of while—but look at Paterson, New Jersey. It was a massive error and a massive miscalculation, and there was incredible fraud. Look at the city council, what's happened to it. This is one place, but you have many places, and they're all over.\nYes, please.\nChina-U.S. Relations\nNo, I haven't spoken to him. No, I don't; I have no plan to speak to him.\nYes, please.\nYes, go ahead.\nNo, I wish her the best. I hope she's better. I didn't hear that, actually. She was just hospitalized? No, that's too bad. No, I wish her the best.\nShe's actually given me some good rulings. Okay? So you know that, right? People were surprised. No, I wish her the absolute best.\nWell, you know, we've banned for Europe, and at some point, that will come off. And we're dealing with them all the time. The relationship is very good; they just don't treat us very well on trade. They are—they have been very unfair to us over many, many decades. And we're doing that. It's very easy to solve. I was all set to solve it actually, and then we got hit with the plague.\nBut we have a travel ban on various countries, and that travel ban remains until such time as we say it doesn't remain.\nOkay, look, my policy is America first. We've lost hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China and many other countries. And what we're doing is just handing everybody everything. It's just a sad—I've watched it, I've looked at it.\nWe did the U.S.-Mexico—you saw that, USMCA. We made a very fair deal on trade. We had the worst deal ever, right? You know that. We had the worst deal ever, and it replaced that; it replaced that horrible NAFTA deal. That was one of the worst trade deals ever made.\nI'll tell you, the only deal that might be worse is the WTO, World Trade Organization. May be worse.\nOAN, please.\nChina-U.S. Trade/Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Policy\nIt's true.\nMeaning \"not to invest\"?\nThat's correct.\nYes.\nYes, and you'll see more coming. This was a very important bill that we signed. But you're going to see more coming over the next short period of time. But yes, we don't want them investing in Chinese military companies. Okay?\nWell, you have a lot of actions we can take, including the—including the increase. You know, right now people don't know: China is paying a lot of tariffs. We made a China deal, and they bought just—I think the third highest amount of corn ever in our—in world history. They just bought from us the highest amount, which is great for our farmers. But I view it differently than I did before I made the deal. When I made the deal, I thought this was a great deal. After what happened to us—what happened to the world, coming from China—I view it much differently. But we can impose massive tariffs on China if we want—and other countries, if we want. And we'll see. We just want to be treated fairly. We want a level playing field. Our farmers were never treated properly by anybody, and they were targeted by China.\nYou know, I paid our farmers $28 billion over a 2-year period because they were targeted to that amount of money—to that exact amount of money: $28 [billion]*. It was $16 billion, and it was $12 billion—$28 [billion]* over a 2-year period. And we gave $28 billion to our farmers. That's why they're all here.\nAnd now they're doing very well. Our farmers are doing very well because we made really great trade deals. USMCA just kicked in. The China deal, they're buying a lot. They are buying a lot. I will say that: They're buying a lot. A lot of people ask, \"How are they doing on the trade deal?\" They're buying a lot.\nSo I want to thank everybody, and we'll be having these conferences again.\nI—we're going to be signing an immigration act very soon; it's going to be based on merit. It's going to be very strong. We're going to work on DACA because we want to make people happy. And I'll tell you, even conservative Republicans want to see something happen with DACA.\nThe Democrats had their chance for 3 years to do something with DACA, and they always turned it down. They always turned it down. They used it as politics. I'm using it to get something done.\nBut we'll be signing a very powerful immigration act. It will be great. It will be merit-based. The country has tried to get it for 25 or 30 years. It will be strong on the border, but you'll come in legally, and you'll be able to come in legally.\nAnd very importantly, we'll be taking care of people from DACA in a very Republican way. A Republicans—I've spoken to many Republicans, and some would like to leave it out, but, really, they understand that it's the right thing to do.\nSo we're going to be taking care of DACA. We will be doing for DACA what the Democrats had a chance to do and they never did it. Okay?\nThank you all very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1242"}
{"Title": "Interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News", "Date": "2020-07-19", "Text": "Thank you very much.\nCases.\nYes, cases.\nChris, that's because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn't test, you wouldn't be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.\nNo, no. But I don't say -- I say flames, we'll put out the flames. And we'll put out in some cases just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it's -- it's going to be under control.\nAnd, you know, it's not just this country, it's many countries. We don't talk about it in the news. They don't talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it's a little ahead of us in that sense.\nBut you take a look, why don't they talk about Mexico?  Which is not helping us. And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn't have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.\nYeah. I think what we'll do -- well, we have them under travel ban too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early.\nBut when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.\nWe will take a look...\nReady?\nCan you please get me the mortality rate?\nKayleigh's right here. I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world.\nDo you have the numbers, please? Because I heard we had the best mortality rate.\nNumber, number one low mortality rate.\nI hope you show the scenario because it shows what fake news is all about. Ok, go ahead.\n-- and we have the best.\nLook, I take responsibility always for everything because it's ultimately my job, too. I have to get everybody in line.\nSome governors have done well, some governors have done poorly. They're supposed to have supplies they didn't have. I supplied everybody.\nNow we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas. And other areas we're doing great. But we have a surge in certain areas. But you don't hear people complaining about ventilators. We've got all the ventilators we can use. We're supplying them to other countries.\nWe go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test. We find -- if we did half the testing -- with all of that being said, I'm glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I'm glad we did what we're doing. But we have more tests by far than any country in the world.\nWell, that's good.\nMany of those cases...\nMany of those cases are young people that would heal in a day. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them -- don't forget, I guess it's like 99.7 percent, people are going to get better and in many cases they're going to get better very quickly.\nWe go out and we look and then on the news -- look if you go back to the news, all of your -- even your wonderful competitors, you'll see cases are up. Cases are up -- many of those cases shouldn't even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing.\nNo country has ever done what we've done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody's done is our job on testing, because we're going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests.\nYou look at other countries; they don't even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they're sick, they're really sick, they test them then, or they'll test them in a doctor's office. But they don't go around have massive areas of testing and we do. And I'm glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.\nI don't play it -- I'm not playing -- no, this is very serious.\nShow me the death chart.\nWell, the death chart is much more important.\nExcuse me, it's all too much, it shouldn't be one case. It came from China. They should've never let it escape. They should've never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they're having cases.\nThey don't test. They don't test.\nIt's possible that they don't test, that's what's possible. We find cases and many of those cases heal automatically. We're finding -- in a way, we're creating trouble. Certainly, we are creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, \"Oh, we have more cases.\"\nLook, we do something that nobody's ever done. Not only the ventilators, where we're supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program the likes of which nobody's ever done before.\nI agree.\nBecause we're not. If one man from my administration doesn't like him because he made a few mistakes -- look, Dr. Fauci said, \"Don't wear a mask.\" Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, \"You saved tens of thousands of lives\" -- more than that. He said, \"You saved tens of thousands of lives.\"\nWell Dr., look, look…\nWell, I don't know that he's a leaker ….\nHe's a little bit of an alarmist. That's OK. A little bit of an alarmist.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-chris-wallace-fox-news-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-07-21", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, and good afternoon. Today I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control. It seems largely in Sun Belt, but could be spreading.\nMy team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package. We're working very hard on it. We're making a lot of progress. I also know that both sides want to get it done. We'll call it \"phase four.\" I think we're going to get it done. We'll protect our workers, our schools, and our families and protect them very strongly.\nAs one family, we mourn every precious life that's been lost. I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We're doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development. But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders. The job they do is incredible, and they are truly brave.\nMy administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important. We've learned so much about this disease. And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them.\nAnd again, the vaccines are coming, and they're coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years. If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years.\nThe China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we've learned a great deal about it and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful. We've developed them as we go along. Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better, something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is. It's the way—it's what we have. If you look over the world, it's all over the world, and it tends to do that.\nThe Governors are working very, very hard, and we are supporting them 100 percent. Everything they need, they get. And we are taking good care. We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it's ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need. So that's a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards.\nThe median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old. Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care. In one study, 90 percent of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it's heart or diabetes, but usually, it's some kind of a condition. It seems that people have that. And if they do, it's a problem, no question about it.\nYoung adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won't even know they're sick. They won't have any idea that they have a virus. They won't have any idea at all. America's youth will act responsibly, and we're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They'll have an effect. And we need everything we can get.\nData shows children have the lowest fatality risk; 99.96 percent of all virus fatalities are in adults. Think of that. So that's much, much, much less than 1 percent for children, young people.\nBy understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we've been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States. In fact, we'll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world. We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, which has been very successful and a widely available steroid treatment. And we have many more happening and coming out.\nWe've learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we've shared them all over the world. But the relationship with other countries has been very strong. We're all working together. This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment, including high-flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators.\nAnd when you're on a ventilator, we've learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator. And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators. But the doctors have become incredibly—and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure.\nAnd allocating remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization. And that's something that they've really started. They're using it much earlier. Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75 percent since mid-April. It's a great number.\nAs cases and fatalities rise in certain hard-hit States, which you're looking at right now, we're surging personnel, supplies, and therapeutics. We again have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape, and we can move them quickly.\nOur case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European Union and almost everywhere else in the world. If you watch American television, you'd think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus. Well, the world is suffering very badly. But the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they've been suffering from this virus for a long time.\nWe've done much better than most. And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it's something that we can talk about, but we're working, again, with them, because we're helping a lot of countries that people don't even know about. I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators. They need help with ventilators; they have to get them. They're very hard to get. We're making thousands now a month—thousands of ventilators a month. It's been quite amazing.\nAnd we keep doing the good job, and things will get better and better. We'll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success and, I guess you could say also, things that we can do better on. But you'll see them. There'll be put up as we go.\nIn April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old. Today, the average age is significantly younger. Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April. So the stays are about half. The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced. And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one-half of what it was in April.\nWe've learned a lot. We've learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it. The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators, but in many other things. And things are happening too, like the remdesivir and other elements, steroids, et cetera.\nBut these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus. And that's what we have: We have a relentless focus. And it's been that way from the beginning. But we have learned so much. As you know, in recent weeks we've seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our South; you look at South, Southwest, and West. This growth in cases first began to appear in mid-June, primarily among 18- to 35-year-olds, many of whom were asymptomatic.\nWe're also facing the challenge of a significant spice [spike]* in virus cases across the rest of the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico. Mexico has been hit very, very, very hard. As you know, the President, a great gentleman, was here 2 weeks ago. And they have really been hit hard.\nBecause we've achieved a nearly fourfold increase in testing capacity in 2 months, we're successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases: some cases so mild that you really don't even treat them; some cases with children, where they don't even know that they're ill. And I guess they're not very ill, because they recover almost immediately.\nPer capita, the U.S. is conducting 50-percent more tests than Europe, and we've conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the Western Hemisphere combined. We'll be over 50 million tests. This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms. So we know exactly where it's going and when it's going to be there.\nWe're also working to reduce turnaround time. My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt, and we continue to do so, working very close with all Governors, but right now, in particular, those Governors.\nWe're coordinating closely with hospitals and Governors. In the last 3 weeks, I've sent senior officials into nine States to meet with Governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the State, including hospital administrators, et cetera.\nMy administration currently has zero unfilled requests for—unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the Governors. No Governor needs anything right now, and we think we'll have it that way until the end, because, frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go.\nWe have nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona that's helping us greatly. I want to thank them very much. The military has been fantastic. We're closely monitoring hospital capacity in these States. Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures. So hospitals are open for elective surgeries.\nWe want Americans to get the medical treatments they need. All of the Governors we've spoken with say they have enough bed capacity. That's a great thing. Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators.\nAnd a permanent shutdown was really never an option. In terms of what we're doing right now, this would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fallback, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences. There are consequences to shutdowns.\nAnd we've saved, potentially, millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown, but now we're very aware of this disease. We understand the disease, to a large extent. And nobody is going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we'll end up with a cure, we'll end up with therapeutics, we'll end up with a vaccine very soon—all three.\nWe're instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene—wash your hands every chance you get—while sheltering high-risk populations. We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. Be safe and be smart. We're surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases. This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the South. We're being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes, because you know all of the problems that we've had with so many people—so sadly, they were infected—so that all of the staff and residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else. That's really the high-risk people—the high-risk, wonderful people.\nOnce this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference. Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic, but to end it. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can. That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority.\nTwo vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks, and we're mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately.\nAnd logistically, we have the military ready to go. We have great people—logistic, military people; a wonderful general who's waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time. That's what's going to happen. So our military is all set to go. We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is that's necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all.\nAnd I'll take a few questions if you'd like.\nI will say this: I want to thank all of the staff: the White House staff, all of the doctors that we've been working with so closely. And it's—just a lot of very positive things are happening. It's a nasty, horrible disease that should have never been allowed to escape China, but it did. And it infected the world, and the world is suffering. But we're going to get it taken care of, and we're helping lots of other countries.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].\nWell, I didn't know about more than one. I do take probably, on average, a test every 2 days, 3 days. And I don't know of any time I've taken two tests in 1 day, but I could see that happening.\nWell, we've done more testing, by far, than anybody. Some of the tests—because it is massive volume—it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick; they're 5 minutes and 15-minute tests. And those are, frankly, the ones that I prefer.\nBut we're doing massive numbers, and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now which give you a 15-minute and a 5-minute test. So we'll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They're also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible. But those numbers will be coming down. I agree. I think it's a good thing if we can do that.\nWell, they're going to make a presentation to me tonight and tomorrow on that. And again, we're leading the world. And I think the second country at 12 million. We're going to be over 50 million tests. Second country is India with 12 million. Then, you have 7 million, 6 million, and 4 million. I think that we are doing a tremendous amount of testing. But if the—if the doctors and the professionals feel that even though we're at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible, that they would like to do more, I'm okay with it.\nWell, Dr. Birx is right outside.\nYes, please.\nCould you speak up, please?\nThis, among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they'll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we're creating. We're setting record job numbers, as you know. I think we're going to have a very strong year next year. I think we're going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter. But I think next year is going to be a record year, and I think they're going to judge me on that.\nI think they're going to judge me on the tax cutting and the regulation cutting, which nobody has ever done to the extent that we've been able to do it.\nOn rebuilding the military, on how we've handled the VA: On the VA, we got Veterans Choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That's been many decades. They've been trying to get Veterans Choice. It's called \"Choice,\" where they can go get a doctor if they have to wait on line for 2 weeks or 5 weeks or 2 days. And frankly, that's been a great thing. And Veterans Accountability, I think they'll judge me on that. They'll judge me on all of the things we've done.\nI don't think—and I think we can say this with surety, and it's never ever been even challenged. In 3½ years, the first 3½ years—the first years of a Presidency—I don't think any administration, any President has accomplished so much as we've accomplished, from energy to health to so many other things.\nAnd then, this came in, and the plague—I call it the \"plague\"—the plague came in, a terrible thing. Should have been stopped. Wasn't stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that, and now we've started them up. And I think we've really started it up very successfully.\nYes, please.\nWell, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I think that—I always like to say, as—you know, either way, when you look at it, the Governors are working with me. I'm working with the Governor. We're working hand in hand. I think we're all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the Governors. Very, very good relationships.\nI could say I'm fully responsible. But you know, one day, we had a virus come in, and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border. And nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn't want people coming in from heavily infected China.\nFairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe—coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. We would have—if it's one person, it's too much. But we're at, let's say, 140,000; we could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn't.\nSo we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right, including with equipment. So it's a shame that it happened. It shouldn't have happened. China should have stopped it.\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nYes.\nWe're trying to do that. That's a great question. We're trying very much to do that. So rather than sending your tests in—and you know, it goes through the mail 1 day, comes back another day, no matter how they send them. It's a day and a day, so that's 2 days already wasted. And then, if it spends—by the time you get it back, it's 3 or 4 days, if they do an efficient job. We're trying to get the testing on site.\nI like it the best.\nI don't know. I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly. I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is. I don't know the situation with Prince Andrew. I just don't know. I'm not aware of it.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWell, the economy is getting stronger, and I think we have a chance to have a very strong economy, especially if some of the things that I just spoke about work.\nWe want to have people go back and want to go back to work as opposed to be, sort of, forced into a position where they're making more money than they expected to make. And the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work.\nSo that was a decision that was made. I was against that original decision, but they did that. It still worked out well because it gave people a lifeline, a real lifeline. Now we're doing it again. They're thinking about doing 70 percent of the amount. The amount would be the same, but doing it in a little bit smaller initial amounts so that people are going to want to go back to work, as opposed to making so much money that they really don't have to.\nBut we were very generous with them. I think that it's been a tremendously successful program. The whole thing has been successful, if you look. I mean, we have—we're in a pandemic, and yet we're producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible. Okay?\nWell, I do. I actually do it when I need. I mean, I carry the mask when I have to go—I went into Walter Reed Hospital the other day. I have the mask right here, and I carry it. And I will use it gladly. No problem with it. And I've said that.\nAnd I say: If you can, use the mask. When you can, use the mask. If you're close to each other, if you're in a group, I would put it on. When I'm in a group—if I'm in an elevator and there are other people with me, including, like, security people, it's not their fault. They have to be in the elevator; I want to protect them also. I put on a mask.\nI will have—I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way: Anything that potentially can help—and that certainly can potentially help—is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. You saw me wearing it a number of times, and I'll continue.\nGo ahead, please.\nWell, I don't know. The hotel—I was pretty far away from people, but I would say this: I've explained it, I think, very well. If you're close together, I would put on the mask, and if you're not—I would say that if you're—for instance, I'll see—like, here, you've been all tested; I've been tested. Oftentimes, I'll be with people that are fully tested; I've been tested. In theory, you don't need the mask. I'm getting used to the mask, and the reason is—think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps.\nNow, we have experts that have said, in the recent past, that masks aren't necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they've changed their mind. If they change their mind, that's good enough for me. So I wear it when appropriate.\nWell, I've always agreed with that. I mean, I've never fought either one. But certainly, social distancing, I want to—it's—that's common sense.\nSix feet, to me, is common sense. I'd like to say maybe make it a little bit further.\nWe have them too. No, we have embers and fires, and we have big fires. And unfortunately, now Florida is in a little, tough—or in a big, tough position. You have a great Governor there. You have a great Governor in Texas. You have people that are very, very skilled people, and I think they're going to handle it very well.\nTheir hospital capacities are holding up, but Texas is a big State, and it's very well run, and so is Florida, and I think they'll do a very good job.\nYes, go ahead.\nYes, we're willing to work with anybody that's going to get us a good result. We're very close to the vaccine. I think we're going to have some very good results. We're already in testing; nobody thought that would be possible. Under the old system, it would be a year to 2 years before you can even think about using the word \"testing.\"\nSo I think we've had a lot of—and the reason we're testing: They've had good results. So now we have to see—and the testing also for safety, because they have to make sure it's safe. And I think you're going to see something over the next fairly short period of time, maybe very short period of time, having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good.\nSo we'll be doing these quite often. We're going to keep you abreast of this, and we'll also talk about some of the other topics like our economy, which is doing well. The stock market had another good day. I think they have a good day, because they see a lot of positive things happening on this front too.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1243"}
{"Title": "Interview with Dr. Marc Siegel for Fox News", "Date": "2020-07-22", "Text": "Well, I think we have to be in good health. I tell you what, this is a very important job to put it mildly. There is nothing like it and I will also say and I think I've had to work harder than others because I've been attacked from fronts that nobody ever got attacked on. With fake investigations, fake Russia, Russia, Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine. I mean nobody's gone through and yet I've done more than any president in the first three years in history. There is no president that's done what we've done with rebuilding the military, the judges. We'll be up to almost 300 judges including two great Supreme Court judges at the end of this term. So it's really something that's been great. But you need stamina. You need physical health and you need mental health.\nAnd because you have so much fake news every once in a while you'd say, first they'd say, \"He wants to take over the world. He's going to take over the world. He's a dictator.\" The next day they'll say, \"He's crazy.\" The next day they'll say, \"Oh, he's incompetent.\" The next day they'll say something. So the last time I was at the hospital, probably a year ago, a little less than a year ago. I asked the doctor, I said, \"Is there some kind of a cognitive test that I could take?\" Because I've been hearing about it because I want to shut these people up. They're fake news, they make up stories. Like I'll do an interview with you I didn't say you can't ask me about this. I say, ask me anything. I did one with Chris Wallace he was nice enough to say he said, \"I just want to tell the audience there was no question that's off bounds.\" Okay and he's a tough cookie.\nAnd it was a good interview. I liked it, I enjoyed it and it was good. But I didn't say you can only ask this, you can only… We have to be sharp. If you're in the office of the presidency, we have to be sharp. So they were saying all these different things, it was going all over. Whichever stuck, none of it stuck fortunately. But one of the reasons it didn't is that I took a test. I said to the doctor, it was Dr. Ronnie Jackson. I said, \"Is there some kind of a test an acuity test?\" And he said there actually is and he named it, whatever it might be and was 30 or 35 questions. The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It's a like you'll go person, woman, man, camera, TV. So they'll say, \"Could you repeat that?\"\nSo I said, \"Yeah.\" So it's person, woman, man, camera, TV. Okay that's very good. If you get it in order, you get extra points. Now he's asking you other questions, other questions and then 10 minutes, 15, 20 minutes later they say, \"Remember the first question? Not the first but the 10th question. Give us that again. Can you do that again?\" You go person, woman, man, camera, TV. If you get it in order, you get extra points. They said nobody gets in an order. It's actually not that easy but for me it was easy. And that's not an easy question. In other words, they ask it to you, they give you five names and you have to repeat them and that's okay if you repeat them out of order, it's okay. But it's not as good. But then when you go back about 20, 25 minutes later and they say, \"Go back to that question.\" They don't tell you this, go back to that question and repeat them. Can you do it? And you go person, woman, man, camera, TV.\nThey say, \"That's amazing. How did you do that?\" I do it because I have a good memory, because I'm cognitively there. Now Joe should take that test because something's going on and I say this with respect. I mean, going to probably happen to all of us, right? It's going to happen, but we can't take a chance of it happening when you're dealing with Russia. And there's nobody been tougher to Russia than me. Nobody been tougher to China than me I can tell you right now they would love to see Joe Biden instead of Trump. We've taken in billions and billions, tens of billions of dollars from China, which they never gave us anything. They had the worst year before the plague came in. They had the worst year and they're just about in their history 67 years, it was the worst year they had in 67 years before the plague.\nAnd we were doing great we had the best economy. But we have to have somebody that's sharp. If this person isn't sharp because I can tell your president Xi is sharp, president Putin is sharp, [inaudible] is sharp. You don't have any non sharp people that you're dealing with. And we can't have somebody that's not a hundred percent. So what I did is you know it's a public test and he said, \"If you take this test we may have to reveal that.\" I said, \"It's all right. I mean is it tough? Tell me about.\" I'd never heard of it. And I got a perfect mark and the doctors they said very few people can do that. Very few people get that you understand?", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dr-marc-siegel-for-fox-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-07-22", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Today my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval. Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly. And we think we have a winner there. We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well on the vaccines, long ahead of schedule.\nAs part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter. This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacture, and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time, really a very small fraction of the time, based on previous schedules. I want to thank the FDA. I want to thank everybody involved. It's been an incredible process.\nAs discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens, as we all know. The median age for those who die from the virus is 78 years old, and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. That's really something.\nIn other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1 percent of the U.S. population. So think of that: less than 1 percent, half of the fatalities. So we know what to look for.\nFrom the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors. In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities. And we gave it a very strong priority. FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it's going directly to 15,400 Medicaid- and Medicare-certified nursing homes throughout the country.\nToday I'd like to provide an update on the additional actions we've been able to take, and they've been very constructive. First, we're requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in States where you had the worst outbreaks. All personnel will be tested at the highest level. We're distributing 15,000 rapid, point-of-care diagnostic devices to support this effort. These are the tests where it takes 5 minutes to 15 minutes. They're very accurate. They're very good. And we're sending them all over the country. And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities.\nSecond, HHS will be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes. Nursing homes in higher risk areas will be receiving more funding. This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing, and providing technology support so residents can connect their families. And they can connect to their families. They are having a tremendous time. They want to be with their loved ones. They can't do it, so what we're doing is we're working it so that we can connect—have them connect with their families if they're not able to visit.\nThird, we've been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the Governors so that the Governors and their staffs can take appropriate action. We're able to find—because of the testing programs and other means, we're able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The Governors can then take action. Additionally, CMS, CDC, and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest risk nursing homes. And that's their priority right now: nursing homes, but the highest risk nursing homes. CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most. And we have them surveyed, and we have them mostly pinpointed.\nOver the past few months, we've created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks. And currently, 99 percent of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it, so we have great data. When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert the State and make sure that it responds very quickly. We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly.\nI want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life. We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope. The light is starting to shine. We will get there very quickly. But we send our love; we send a message of love—very important. We're with you all the way.\nAs far as the outbreak in the Sun Belt, I said yesterday: We continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the South and Southwest and the West. We're closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida. Arizona is starting to come down. Done a very good job. They're all doing a good job. They're very talented people.\nThere are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations—which you know very well about—which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide. And a substantial increase in travel also was a cause.\nIncreased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places—maybe beaches—four or five different listed places; we have 12 that are listed on the guide—likely also contributed.\nWe're also sharing a 2,000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well, and cases are surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the President, and it's a big problem for Mexico. But cases are surging very sharply and all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere.\nTwo hundred and fifty-seven miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great, positive impact on people coming in. And we have record-low numbers of people coming in illegally; that's helped greatly. It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we're doing right now and for the pandemic.\nNationwide, beyond the outbreak in several States, cases remain low and very stable. Nineteen States have positive test rates of less than 5 percent. Eight States have positive test rates of less than 2 percent. Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8 percent, compared to over 16 percent at its peak in April. It's coming down. It's coming down fairly rapidly.\nToday we surpassed—first time—we surpassed 50 million tests. That's far more than any country in the world. India is second, we believe. We think—1.4 billion people; that's about 12 million tests. We have 50 million tests.\nWe're working with every State to ensure the supply of remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill. We're working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes—everybody. The remdesivir has proven to be terrific. Our case fatality rate continues to decline, and we want to push this rate even lower. The therapeutic research continues daily on new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use of blood thinners and steroids. A lot of different things are happening, and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn't have known a number of months ago. We're doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines.\nAnd frankly, therapeutically—or maybe a word even beyond that word is \"cure\"—would be the best of all, and we'll see what happens. But that would be great if we could go into the hospital and just cure people. And we're at a position where we're actually able to, to a certain extent, with what we have right now. And we think, in a very short period of time, we'll be able to do that.\nOur strategy is to shelter the highest risk Americans, while allowing younger and healthier citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant. Wear a mask, socially distance, and repeatedly wash your hands. Practice very, very good sanitary means. You have to do this. You have to just—you have to look at it differently. Wash your hands often. I'm finding more and more people are saying, \"Wash your hands.\" So wash your hands. We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings.\nAnd we're all in this together. And as Americans, we're going to get this complete. We're going to do it properly. We've been doing it properly. Sections of the country come up that we didn't anticipate—for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera—but we're working with very talented people, very brilliant people, and it's all going to work out, and it is working out.\nSo, with that, I'll take a few questions, please.\nYes, please.\nCrime in U.S. Cities/Federal Coronavirus Response\nYes.\nBut we haven't had that failure. And——\nYes, the cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by Democrats. You have radical-left Democrats running cities like Chicago and so many others that we just had a news conference. And unfortunately, that's the way it is. I mean, that's the facts.\nWhen you look at Chicago and you look at the job—Mayor Lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday, and I think, in their own way, they want us to go in. There'll be a time when they're going to want us to go in full blast, but right now we're sending extra people to help. We're arresting a lot of people that have been very bad.\nAs far as the coronavirus, as you say, I think we've done some amazing things, and I think you'll probably see that if you compare our statistics to other countries. And if you look at death rates, et cetera, you're going to see—and especially into the future, with what's happening—you're going to see some very, very impressive numbers for the United States.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], please.\nYes. Well, I am comfortable with that. And we do have a national strategy, but, as you know, ultimately, it's up to the Governors of the States. I think most Governors, many Governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open, especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open.\nWe just had a report, literally as I walked in, that we set an alltime record on housing price increases, up, I think they said, 21 percent, which is a record. It's never happened before. That's a great sign. We have an economy that's going to be booming. It's going to be—a lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly—meaning over the next week or so—and I think it will be a continuation of the last 2 months. The last 2 months have been incredible.\nSo I think we're going to have a great economy. You're going to have a fantastic next year. I think you're going to have a very good third quarter, actually, when the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, they'll be announced just before the election. They'll be announced around November 1.\nSo yes, I would like to see the schools open, open a hundred percent. And we'll do it safely; we'll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read, having to do with children and—and safety, they're very impressive. They have very strong immune systems.\nPlease.\nSure.\nWell, they do say that they don't transmit very easily. And a lot of people are saying they don't transmit, and we're looking at that. We're studying, Jon, very hard that particular subject: that they don't bring it home with them.\nNow, they don't catch it easily; they don't bring it home easily. And if they do catch it, they get better fast. We're looking at that fact. That is a factor, and we're looking at that very strongly. We'll be reporting about that over the next week.\nYes.\nWell, I think all are suggesting if you want to wear a mask, you wear it. I bring one. I have one. I've worn it. And I think when I'm in certain settings, like hospitals and various—or when I'm close—when, you know, when you can't socially distance, I believe in it. Let's see: Do I? I do. I have it.\nAnd if—you know, in certain—in certain instances, I think you really—I think you want to travel with a mask. There are instances where you really can use it. I would believe it would be a good thing.\nYes, please.\nWe're going to make a decision over the next 24 hours. We'll let you know what that decision is. Okay?\nThank you.\nWell, I think a lot of politicians are discussing that: Republicans, Democrats. And right now a lot of my representatives are on the Hill. They're discussing CARES Act or phase four, whatever you want to call it. And I think, ultimately, something good will come out of it.\nThe economy is starting to really come back strongly, when you look at the numbers—even with the fact that—like California is still closed up and many big States. I think the numbers are even more impressive, considering that some States like California—big ones—are pretty well shut down.\nSo we expect to have something over a period of time—over the appropriate period of time.\nPlease, go ahead.\nDeployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities\nI didn't say I that. I didn't say who supported——Q.Millions of Americans voted for these people——\nNo. I said Democrat politicians, and these are the cities where you have the problem. If you look at Chicago, if you look at Detroit, if you look—I mean, look around any of these cities where we have the problems. And we're sending them help, but we're really waiting for them to call for the big help, for the big numbers, for the large numbers of people that we have ready, willing, and able.\nYou look at Chicago, where 14 people were shot yesterday; where, over the weekend, many people died, and many people were shot; and, over the last month, they're setting record numbers. We are waiting for the mayor, respectfully, and other mayors and Governors to call us. We are ready, willing, and able to go in there with great force.\nNow, we also have people that are going in and arresting drug dealers, arresting some of the shooters that are doing the shooting. We know who they are. We're working with police forces. And even though, in some cases, they're told, \"Don't work with the Federal Government,\" the police forces have great respect for the Federal Government, what we do.\nBut we're ready, willing, and able to go into these cities that are just being decimated with shooting. And we're going to help.\nBecause they are briefing me. I'm meeting them. I just spoke to Dr. Fauci. Dr. Birx is right outside. And they giving me all of—everything they know, as of this point in time. And I'm giving the information to you, and I think it's probably a very concise way of doing it. It seems to be working out very well.\nBut they're very much—they're very much involved. They're very much—the relationships are all very good. All very good. The relationships that we have with the doctors, with everybody working on the virus has been, I think, extraordinary.\nKayleigh is here, and I think you would say the same thing. You work with them all the time.\nYes, go ahead. Please.\nCrime in Chicago, Illinois/Former President Barack Obama/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S. Cities\nChicago is a disaster. The mayor is saying, \"Don't come in.\" The mayor is telling us not to come in. At some point, we can void that if we have to, but we—and we may have to, at some—because it's out of control. I assume she's saying that for political reasons. I think it's negative political reasons.\nShe's a Democrat. I'm going to be nice. She's a Democrat. She's making a big mistake. People are dying in Chicago and other cities, and we can solve the problem. They have to ask us, but——Q.Right, but——\n——we can solve the problem.\nBecause President Obama was invited in, and he did a poor job. President Obama could have gone into Chicago. He could have solved the problem, and he didn't. In our case, they don't want us in. We can solve the problem very easily. We're equipped with the best equipment, the best people.\nAnd you see what we're doing. I mean, Portland was coming down; it was busting at the seams. And we went in and protected all the Federal buildings. Those Federal buildings are totally protected. But—and we had to do that. And Portland is a very different place than Chicago.\nBut Chicago should be calling us—and so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others—to go in and really help them. Because when you're losing many people a weekend—many, many people; you see the same numbers as I do—when you're losing these people, they should call us, and they should say, \"Come on in.\" And it's incredible to me, but they're not doing it.\nAt some point, they will. At some point, we may have no other choice but to go in.\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], please.\nTrump Turnberry Resort in Turnberry, Scotland/China-U.S. Relations\nNo, I never spoke to Woody Johnson about that, about Turnberry. Turnberry is a highly respected course, as you know, one of the best in the world. And I read a story about it today. And I had never—I never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that. No.\nAs far as closing additional Embassies, it's always possible. You see what's going on. We thought there was a fire in the one that we did close. And everybody said: \"There's a fire. There's a fire.\" And I guess they were burning documents or burning papers, and I wonder what that's all about.\nOkay, how about one or two more? Please.\nWell, you know, it's interesting because we did criminal justice reform. We passed criminal justice reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We did the greatest—if you look at what we've done with Opportunity Zones, nobody has ever even thought of a plan like that.\nPrior to the China plague coming in, floating in, coming into our country, and really doing terrible things all over the world—doing terrible things—we had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American—almost every group was the best for unemployment. The unemployment numbers were the best. You look at—so you look at employment; you look at Opportunity Zones; and maybe most importantly of all, you look at criminal justice reform; you look at prison reform. I've done things that nobody else—and I've said this, and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it: I've done more for Black Americans than anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1244"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-07-23", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.\nWe've had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus. I have reminded people of the importance of masks when you can't socially distance, in particular. A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places.\nYesterday we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents. We're working very hard on that. We're doing very well all over the country. And also about contracting with Pfizer—we made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer. We think they're very close—but we have a lot of companies that are very close—to produce a vaccine.\nAnd I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you: This afternoon my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida. It's a place I love. And I love that State. The drawings look absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good, so fast with everything going on. And everything was going well—a tremendous list of speakers; thousands of people wanting to be there—and I mean, in some cases, desperately be there. They wanted to attend. People making travel arrangements all over the country; they wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line.\nBut I looked at my team, and I said: \"The timing for this event is not right. It's just not right with what's happened recently—the flareup in Florida—to have a big convention. It's not the right time.\" It's really something that, for me—I have to protect the American people. That's what I've always done. That's what I always will do. That's what I'm about.\nThey said: \"Sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm. Incredible enthusiasm. Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they've seen. We can do this safely, and we can do it responsibly.\"\nAnd I said, \"There's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that's from the China virus or the radical-left mob that you see in Portland\"—where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days. They went in, and people were out of control for 51 days, a long time. And Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in, and they've done a great job protecting our property—the Federal courthouse and other property—and, most importantly, protecting our people. Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit—a lot of other cities where so many people are shot, and so many people are killed. And people elected me to help and to protect.\nSo I told my team, \"It's time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP convention.\" We'll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday, as has always been planned. We were never taking that off. That's remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That's where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina, and they'll be doing the nomination. And we're going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online—the week that we're discussing, which will be really good. I think we're going to do it well. And I'll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won't do a big, crowded convention per se. It's just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country—and even in the world—who would be coming into the State, and I don't want to do anything to upset it. They'll be doing very well very shortly. We're going to put some maps up of the country behind me, and you'll see that the area that we're talking about is a hotspot. You will also see a lot of the country is—has no problem whatsoever—most of the country, actually. So I'm always going to take care of you, so that that's the way we're going to do it.\nI've spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community and its great mayor. He's a great, great guy. Really great guy. They wanted it so badly. And all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida. And just very special people, a very special group. And they were there for us, a hundred percent.\nToday I want to provide an update on the actions we're taking to support the safe reopening of America's schools. Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they're essential to our children's future. Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high-risk factors can continue to participate from home. Very important.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen. It said, quote:\n\"Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in [a] social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical [and] sexual abuse, substance abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. This, in turn, places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and of, in some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there has been [a] substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and [for] families.\" So that's very important, and there's a highway—it goes both ways.\nThe National Education Association recently stated, \"Despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support.\" Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important.\nOne study estimates that, due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35-percent behind in reading compared to the typical year and more than 50-percent behind in math. That's a big statement.\nAccording to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low-income Black and Hispanic students. They're the ones that are hit the hardest. We don't want that happening.\nThirty million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals. Over 70 percent of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools. According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly, having to do with child abuse, they have neglect—and these are neglect and neglected cases are submitted by education personnel. So people in the education world, on the premises, will be the ones that report neglect and other problems when they see the children. They know if they've been neglected. They know if they've been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it's at home or someplace else. But they see this at school. And you don't get to see that if you're not going to school. It's a big thing.\nFortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus, very substantially. When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. Ninety-nine percent of all China virus hospitalizations are adults. And 99.96 percent of all fatalities are adults. That means that children are a tiny percentage, less than 1 percent and even a small percentage of 1 percent.\nIn a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States than have been lost thus far to the coronavirus. Many different names. Many, many different names.\nThe life of every child is sacred and must be protected. Our sole focus is the health and well-being of America's children.\nI have a very, very special person who loves children, who is, I think, one of the greatest athletes of all time. A lot of people say \"the greatest pitcher of all time.\" Known as a \"relief pitcher\" who could have been whatever he wanted. Some people—he is the greatest reliever of all time, by far. Substantially more saves than anybody else. In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently.\nAnd he—I'm reading off these stats. I knew he was the best. I knew he was great, but I didn't know it was almost double anybody else. But he's a man who loves children—has children, loves children, works hard with children. We're going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera—you know, he's the \"Sandman,\" right? My wife said, \"Darling, why do they call him the 'Sandman'?\" I said: \"You know, they play the song. He just puts the batters to sleep.\" And that's exactly what happened.\nSo having Mariano here is a great honor. Thank you very much. He was talking about children in schools. And there's nobody that's done more than you have. Thank you very much, Mariano. Fantastic man.\nGiven these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely, provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers, and to protect students. And we do have to protect the teachers and the families also; we have to remember that.\nAll families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at higher risk.\nIn cities or States that are current hotspots—and you'll see that in the map behind me—districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks, and that's possible. That will be up to Governors. The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community, but every district should be actively making preparations to open.\nAgain, the children obviously have a very strong immune system, maybe even as strong as yours. They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem. So it's pretty amazing actually. Great, great credit.\nOur strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide. As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk—much lower, in the case of young children—to resume work and school and—as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing. We want that.\nA permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms. We don't want to do that.\nAt the same time, we have to get our economy going. We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday. Housing prices—pricing of housing up 21 percent. It's the highest in history. It's the highest number in history. Real estate housing went up 21 percent. Today the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely. I hope that local leaders put the full health and well-being of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions. This isn't about politics, this is about something very, very important. This is not about politics. I even think it's bad politics if you do the wrong decision. Very bad politics.\nWe're asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next coronavirus relief bill. This funding will support mitigation measures, such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aides, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing, and crucially, mask-wearing. This money is in addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year. That money we have; some is distributed, and some is not distributed.\nIf schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice. The key word being \"choice.\" If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions. So we'd like the money to go to the parents of the student. This way, they can make the decision that's best for them.\nWe cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school, harming their mental, physical, and emotional development. Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families.\nThe Council of Economic Advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year. That's a tremendous problem. It's a tremendous problem. Schools have to open safely, but they have to open.\nMore than a dozen European countries—as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others—have already reopened schools, and cases have not risen. We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.\nWe'll continue to support States and cities in the current hotspots in the South, Southwest, and West. The Governors, I know them all. They're all very, very capable. They're doing a very good job. They're working so hard. You wouldn't even believe it.\nWe have nearly 30,000 Federal personnel deployed in the States that need assistance. We're helping with doctors and nurses, medical personnel of all kinds. As a PPE update, we're in close communication with Governors and States. We have supplies, everything they could possibly need. We're very strong on supplies. Remember I used to say the cupboards were bare? Well, now the cupboards are the opposite.\nDue to our historic efforts to increase both the National Stockpile and the State stockpiles, the vast majority of the States have 60 days' worth of supplies on hand. And most importantly, they have ventilators, because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past. Now we're making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them, in many cases, to other countries.\nFor States that are making requests, we're rapidly delivering. In the last 24 hours, FEMA has deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000—well, let me change that. We've created about 600,000 different supplies. We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington. I think the number is 600. We'll go check that, and we'll give it you in a little while. But we've got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators. I think we've sent out about 600 just recently.\nThe United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world, by far. Roughly half of the tests are either the rapid, point-of-care tests, which, frankly, solves a lot of problem in delay, 5 to 15 minutes, instead of waiting for service both ways, in both directions, and then at the lab. But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are 5- to 15-minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day, in some cases, immediately.\nWe're continuing to surge testing to current hotspots, such as Miami and Phoenix, to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further. This is a copy of the map, and this is a—you have it right behind me. That's really very much indicating where the problems are. You see from that, it's in great shape, lots of it. The Northeast has become very clean. The country is in very good shape, other than if you look South and West—some problems. That will all work out.\nOn therapies: We've worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of remdesivir are arriving this week. That's a lot. That's a really—that's a lot. They're working around the clock to make it. It's had a tremendous impact. We've also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past 2 weeks. Arizona is doing very well; it's heading down. Numbers are heading down, I think, very quickly. The Governor has done a great job. They've all done a great job. They've all done a great job. Working hard.\nWe'll continue to monitor the areas rising and—with respect to cases. And we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation, this horrible disease that was sent to us by China.\nIt should not have been sent. They should have stopped it. They could have stopped it. They didn't. And the entire world has gotten infected, and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now.\nThis morning I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they're going through a very hard time with this, in Moscow, in particular. I spoke to the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia. They're doing well, but they're going through a lot. Everybody is going through a lot. Yesterday I spoke to the heads of four different countries. All four are going through a lot. They're going through a hard time.\nThis could have been stopped. It could have been stopped quickly and easily. But for some reason, it wasn't, and we'll figure out what that reason was.\nSo, with that, if you have any questions. Please.\nI just felt it was wrong, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], to have people going to what turned out to be a hotspot. You know, when we chose it, it was not at all hot; it was free. And all of a sudden, it happened quickly. It happens quickly. And it goes away, and it goes away quickly. The key is, we want it to go away without a lot of death, without a lot of problems.\nAnd we're learning so much about the disease. That's why we're very cognizant of nursing homes—we're watching them very carefully—and people over a certain age, and especially people over a certain age with diabetes or heart disease, in particular—but with a problem.\nSo we didn't want to take any chances. So we had a lot of people. We have—the delegates want to be there. We're going to do a fairly reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina. The nomination will be produced. And then, we'll announce what we're doing, how we're doing it, whether it's something that's done online; I guess you could call it \"online.\" So there can nothing—there can be nothing like our last convention, unfortunately. That was a great convention and in a great place, as you know. We had a great time—a great time—in Cleveland.\nBut it's a different world, and it will be for a little while. We want to get the world back to what it was, and I think we'll have that, including great job numbers, including so many things that are happening so positive.\nI have to say, the stock market is close to records. For NASDAQ, it is a record. It's already exceeded its highest numbers. But we want to get our country back to what it was.\nCoronavirus Outbreak in China/China-U.S. Trade\nWe haven't set that yet, Steve . We'll have that—we'll probably announce that over the next few days.\nLook, we've done a great job. We built the greatest economy in the world. Nobody close, not China, not anybody. We had to close it, we saved millions of lives, then we opened it. But we had the best numbers in history for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, every group you want to name: young people without a diploma, young people with a high school diploma, with a college diploma. Anything you want to name, we had the best numbers. Women doing incredibly. Never been a time like that.\nAnd we had to turn it off because of what China did. We had to turn it off. And then, all of the sudden, now we turn it back on, and we're doing very well. But it was very bad.\nChina—speaking about China—the trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it. When I made it, it was a great deal. But they're setting records. Yesterday was a record corn day. They purchased more corn than any order ever, and that went on for 2 or 3 days. And soy beans and all. But it just means much less to me. Can you understand that? It just means much less to me.\nPlease, go ahead.\nNo, they didn't. We're dealing with them, but they didn't. I would just say safety. Just safety. I just—you know, I could see the media saying: \"Oh this is very unsafe. This is\"—I don't want to be in that position. It's safety—not because of the media, but that's what they would say.\nAnd we'll have a very nice something; we'll figure it out. It will be online, in some form. Maybe it will be something even a little bit different. We have time. You know, we're talking about the end of August. But I think it will be something that will be exciting, but there can be nothing like having 25,000 people.\nWe had a tremendous thing planned in—and a tremendous convention planned in North Carolina. And it would have been very good, but a much smaller version in Florida. But then, we saw what was happening. Pretty quickly, we saw that the virus was coming up that coast.\nRise in Coronavirus Cases in Florida/School Reopening Efforts Q.Do you think it's an acknowledgment of the severity of the situation in Florida?\nNo, I think it's going to come and go. It will. I mean, you take a look at—some of these locations were heavily infected. I mean, to a point where—Deborah and I were talking that—you know, when you look at what happened in New York and what happened in New Jersey and other places. And now you're looking, and it's gone. I hope it stays gone. I think we—I think it will. But we had to be—we have to be vigilant. We have to be careful.\nAnd we also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important. It's hard for us to say we're going to have a lot of people packed in a room, and then other people shouldn't do it.\nDon't forget, we're talking about schools. And we want them to be vigilant. And we're saying, \"Open.\" And then, we're saying—here you have a big room. But I also—if you notice, I said, \"Where bars are crowded, where other things are crowded.\" Well, there's nothing more crowded than a convention. A convention—I mean, you've seen them. And even though you try and keep people away from each other, it's just not that kind of a thing. They probably can't do that. It just doesn't work for them. So it's a very hard—so I think we're setting an example by doing it. It's very important.\nYes, John [John Roberts, Fox News].\nYes.\nYes, I think so. I mean, I—a lot of people feel differently about testing. We talk about it a lot. When we have 50 million tests-plus, and you know, we broke the 50 million-test mark.\nSecond in the world is India, which has 1.4 billion people, and they had 12 million tests. And other countries that are very big had 2 million tests. And some countries essentially only test if you're sick and walk into a hospital or walk into a doctor's office or you're literally really sick. They essentially don't do tests unless you're sick, and I understand that too.\nSo yes, if they feel that that's what they want, it's—that would be fine.\nI would if they want. Again, we've done 50 million tests. There's nobody even close in the whole world. You look at our mortality rate. You look at our death rate. You look at different statistics. We're doing very well. But one death is too many. This should never have happened. This should never have been allowed to happen—from China.\nYes, I'd like to see a payroll tax cut. I think it's great for the workers. The Democrats would never have gone for it. They don't want it. They're not big into the workers, I guess. And based on that, I told them last night—I told the Republicans, who have been working very hard on this, I'll tell you—and they want what's right for the country—and hopefully, the Democrats ultimately will.\nBut I said, \"I think a payroll tax will be good, but you're not going to get it from the Democrats.\" We need their votes, as you know. It's not like—you know, we have a majority, but it's not enough that we—that's why I guess we have an election coming up. So you still need Democrat votes, and we're not going to get the Democrat votes on that.\nSo I'd like to see it. I think it would be very good for the workers. But if we're not going to get their votes, I guess we have to go on to the next thing. A payroll tax cut would have been very good. And maybe something happens.\nYes, please.\nWell, baseball, as an example—we were discussing it a little while ago—you're going to be at an empty stadium. I've agreed—Randy Levine is a great friend of mine from the Yankees, and he asked me to throw out the first pitch, and I think I'm doing that on August 15 at Yankee Stadium. And I say, \"How's the crowd going to be?\" And you know, it's like you don't have a crowd; there is no such thing.\nIt's going to be interesting, Mariano. He's not used to that. I've been at many games. He walks in; the place goes crazy. I think it'd be just as good without the crowd. You were just born with it, you know. Some people are born with it.\nI don't know if—this is only for the baseball players, but I've never seen a pitcher throw a ball where so many bats were broken as Mariano. He's got the alltime record. I said, \"How do you do that?\" He said, \"Parents.\" Great parents, when you get right down to it. Right? \"How do you do that?\" It's called parents.\nYes, I just—just to finish, I think—I think that we have to all set examples. I think Major League Baseball is setting the example by, you know, playing to empty stadiums, and so are other sports. You see that. Now, then they'll allow a certain number in. I see golf is now—soon will be allowing people to come in, in percentages. And all of a sudden, we want to get back to normal. The key is to get back to normal, because nobody wants to see this. But I think it's really good that baseball is opening. It looks like football is opening. It looks like sports are opening. We have—it's a tremendous thing, psychologically, for our country.\nAnd we're all, whether we're see—we're going to see right now some beautiful, young Little Leaguers outside with a great future ahead of them. They're already practicing on the front lawn of the White House, and we're going to go out and say hello to them, and it'll be really great.\nOkay, how about one more? Yes, please. Go ahead.\nI don't know that they're putting it in this bill, but I know they want to have a new FBI building. This one is very old, and it's really—it was never built to a very high standard, as you probably have heard. And it's got a lot of danger involved and panels falling off the outside and pieces of concrete falling off the building.\nAnd they want to build it at the site that they have it. They had options very far away from Washington. And I said to him, \"Frankly, you have to be near the Justice Department.\" There's nothing better than the site. The site they have now is better. But they were looking in sites in Maryland and Virginia, in different places, but they would have been too far away.\nSo I am—I've been encouraging them to build it. And if you're going to—you have a choice: You can renovate the existing building—but it's not a good building—or you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for a hundred years and have it be incredible. Even with tracks on top, they're talking about—you know, we have—because FBI people like to work out a lot. And you could have, literally, quarter-mile tracks on top. It's a very big site, a very wide site.\nSo I think the idea—the best idea would be to build a new building. And that way, you have it for a long time. Renovation can never be as good as a new building, in that case. I know they're talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else. But the FBI needs a new building, and we'll get it done.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1245"}
{"Title": "Interview with Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports", "Date": "2020-07-24", "Text": "He's a big fan of you.\nWe'll do that.\nWell, you're doing pretty well on that [crosstalk] .\nYeah, we are. We have good numbers.\nYou started very well, that's good.\nWere you involved with that show in some way?\nAll these guys, I said, \"Hey, this guy is a total fraud,\" and I left, and then I found out.\nYou're the only one that's ever given me credit for that.\nNow I like this interview. No matter what he does it, I like this interview now, Mariano. That's right. I said, \"What's going on with this guy?\" I just felt it was a phony deal.\nHe said he was from British Broadcasting Corporation. They called up with everything, beautiful, the voices, \"This is British Broadcast …\" And then this guy shows up, I said, \"This is a …\" like immediately. And thank you very much, you gave me credit.\nBecause I never get credit for anything good.\nYou're pretty good. I like you.\nWell, I mean, you can always say you run for office, right? You become successful. You could run for a lower office, you can do things, but there are ways. You get groups together and there can be very friendly ways of doing it, very successful. I mean, you're going to have negative rebounds if it keeps up the way it is. As an example of Portland, this is crazy. 51 days, we sent in very powerful, not military but very strong people. The police are good but they were told not to do anything by the radical left mayor. Now you have to go out and speak your mind. I think speaking your mind is good, but you have to do it fairly. We are for justice, but we're for law and order. It's got to be law and order, and there is law and order.\nI put something out when they were starting to rip down statues. I went out, I found an old law, an old bill, you couldn't get it passed today. You get 10 years in jail. 10 years and no games, and we have a lot of people in jail right now. If you ripped down a federal statue, because the states have to take care of their own, unfortunately, because I'd do that too, but you rip down a federal statue you get 10 years in jail. 10 years, no three months, and nothing's happened since then. It was amazing. I signed it. I had a news conference. I said, \"If you do it …\" And we were supposed to have thousands of people march on Washington that day, nobody showed up.\nSometimes for a purpose. I mean, but-\nI think it was happening, and then we got hit by the China Virus. I think it was happening, success. Our country never did better. The best employment numbers in the history of our country. Best unemployment numbers, African American, Asian, American, Hispanic American, everybody, best unemployment numbers in history, Best stock market we've ever had. Although I must tell you, as you know probably very well, the stock market is almost at the same level right now, which a great tribute.\nBut the stock market has been absolutely great.\nA lot of things are happening. Great housing numbers the other day, great everything. We're doing really well. We're trying to get rid of the rest of this pandemic, but success does it, and we were ready to do it. Because if you look at, when you say Hispanic, or when you say African American, Asian American, they were all working. Everybody was making a lot of money. Everybody was doing good, and it was coming together, and then China sent us this horrible, bad present, a real bad present. They could have stopped it. They should've stopped it. We made a trade deal with China, and it was a great deal, but it means much less to me now than it did then, because I'm not happy with what they've done to the world. They stopped it going into China from Wuhan, but they didn't stop it going into Europe, the United States and the rest of the world.\nBut we were ready to do it, and the word is success, and I think we're going to have that. I think we're going to have a great next year. You'll be able to see the results before the election, which is interesting because the election is November 3rd, at the beginning of November, the numbers are going to come out for the third quarter. I predict those numbers are going to be really great, despite the fact that Democrats want to keep their areas closed because they want the numbers to be bad.\nI mean, can you imagine?\nI know how you feel about that. I think a big part of the reason they do it is for politics.\nI don't like the kneeling. I must be honest with you, I don't like the kneeling. I didn't like it for the NFL. I think there are many ways of showing you're unhappy, because when the NFL was happening-\nI know, exactly. I know that. I've heard that actually. I don't know why he did it. In the middle of the summer, all of a sudden, sitting in a T-shirt in his basement, he came out with this thing that nobody was even thinking about it.\nI don't understand. He's talking in the middle of the summer, he comes out and he's sitting there and he looked nice, but I wouldn't say like Mariano. He looked nice in his T-shirt. I don't know if I'd look much worse than that to be honest with you. I wouldn't wear a T-shirt. I think he would've looked better in a suit and tie.\nNo, he would have looked better in a suit and tie. If I had any advice, number one, he could have waited until at least the fall. But more importantly, I would have worn a suit or a tie or even an open shirt that's loose, not tight.\nOkay. So he came out with this thing, Dave, and everyone was saying, \"Where did this come from now?\" And the whole big thing started, and he's made a mistake.\nWell, he wanted no part of you, obviously.\nNo, but I think it was a wise move.\nIt was a very smart move he did.\nLook, he's working hard and everything, but it's a strange thing.\nWell, he makes a lot of money.\nHe's the one, the only one I've shaken hands with in a long time. You, because you stuck your hand out, and I'm saying, \"What are we doing?\" But I shook your hand. You were tested?\nOtherwise they'd take you out right now. They'll end the interview. Did you notice that? He stuck his hand out and I said, \"What do I do here?\" Rather than insult him, I said fine.\nHey, I immediately ran, washed my hands, no. In the days, like four months ago, I just … People don't know that I get along really great with the world leaders. I'm tougher with the world leaders than any president's been. I've been tougher on Russia by far with the pipeline, with our military, with the oil. Now the number one energy producer in the world, and there's nobody even close. I've been very tough with Russia. I mean, China, nobody's been tough like me with China. And that's not to be tough, that's because for years they've taken advantage. So many countries, not those two only, the whole world, our allies, NATO, the whole world has taken advantage of our country.\nBut despite that, I have a very good relationship with leaders. I mean-\nI shake their hand. I hug them.\nI have a lot of great … Abe of Japan, look, they've been ripping us off for years and years. They send the cars in, there's no tax. We send a car to them, they say, \"We don't take your cars.\" This is the kind of thing that we've put up with. We defend these countries, we get nothing for it. I've ended a lot of the craziness that's gone on.\nThere are times when I love it, too much sometimes, right?\nWhere's Dan? I think we have-\nDan, what's our number now, total?\nCan you believe it?\nIt's mine. I don't know if I'll ever use it again, but it certainly was good. It's a platform … Look, we have fake news. You don't know about that, but we have fake news out there.\nAnd then, Dave, we have a very big voice. When you have the kind of numbers that we have, you're able to get the word out and an honest word, and it's important. So it's been very important for me.\nToo often.\nIn the old days, before this, you'd write a letter and you'd say, \"This letter is really bad,\" you put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say, \"Oh, I'm glad I didn't send it,\" right? But we don't do that with Twitter. We put it out instantaneously. We feel great, and then you start getting phone calls, \"Did you really say this?\" I say, \"What's wrong with that?\" And you find a lot of things. You know what I find? It's not the tweets, it's the retweets that get you in trouble.\nYou see something that looks good and you don't investigate it, and you don't look at what's on the helmet exactly, which is in miniature and you don't blow it up, and sometimes it's … I have found almost always, it's the retweets that get you in trouble.\nGood.\nWell, they say he was a good basketball player, and he is a very nice guy.\nWell, he was not tall, but he was a fast little guard, and they say he was a good basketball player. He's actually a very nice guy. We don't always agree on everything. He'd like to do things that I don't like to do, but ultimately I make the decision, but we make it all a group of people. And he's been here for like 45 years, for many, many years, and he's a nice man actually.\nWell, he'd like to see it closed up for a couple of years, but that's okay because I'm president, so I say, \"Well, I appreciate your opinion, now give me another opinion, somebody please.\"\nWell, you have to. Now we're open and we're doing well, and I just had a press conference about opening the schools. You've got to open the schools. They have a stronger immune system even than you have, or I have, the kids.\nThat's not saying much?\nBut they do. They have it. It's amazing. You look at the percentage, it's a tiny percentage of 1%. And in that one case, I mean, I looked at a couple of cases, if you have diabetes, if you have problems with something, but the kids are in great shape. So we want to open the schools and we're opening the country. We had great numbers announced the other day. And two weeks ago, we had the biggest number of jobs we've ever had. And the month before that, we had the same thing. A lot of good things are happening, and I think it looks like a V. We have a lot of people that would like to see their states closed. I have a feeling on November 4th, they'll open them up. I think they want to do it for political reasons, but we're doing well.\nThe polls are starting to really shape up. Dave, we were doing great. We were sailing. George Washington would have had a hard time beating us. And then when the China virus came in, all of a sudden, it's a dampener, it really is.\nWell, it's a downer, though, psychologically. It went down, and now we're really starting to do well. We're looking really good at a lot of different places.\nI was in so many rap songs, like 79 or something. I was in every rap. This is before I did this, right? It's a very interesting thing that you say, because the best day in my life in terms of business and life and everything was the day before I announced I'm running for president. Everything was good. The company was good. I had finished up a lot of jobs that were very successful, and then I said, \"I want to do this.\" Now, I'm really glad I did, but I was treated very unfairly with fake Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. Ukraine, Ukraine, all fake stuff. It's a very vicious business.\nSomebody said, \"Who's the toughest in the world to deal with? Is it Russia? Is it China? Could it be North Korea?\" I said, \"No, the toughest is the United States. It's the toughest to deal with.\" When you look at what I have to do, I have to focus on the big picture, but I also have to focus … I have so many people on the left or call them Democrats, call them whatever you want, and then you look at what they're doing with cities. Every city is run by a liberal Democrat and they're going to hell, and we have to do something. We just sent people into Chicago. We sent people into Portland, as we said. We're sending people into New York to help out. It's incredible, but I love doing it. There was this phony deal that I was devastated when I won, because I couldn't have my life. I had a great life, I did.\nOne thing that happened, I was going into a thing called the Robin Hood Foundation. I'll never forget it. It was just about the night I announced or whatever. And my wife looked at me, she said, \"I hear people booing.\" And she was with me for a long time. We've been together a long time. She said, \"Some people are booing.\" I said, \"Yeah, but some people were also clapping wildly.\" She said, \"You know what, I've been with you a long time, I've never heard anyone boo you.\" This was right after I started being the politician. It meant something because I said it's the first time in my life I was ever booed. You know this.\nI'd go to Yankee stadium, people would go … Who is a 100%? But it was pretty close. And now, I would say this, I have more fervor on the one side, and I have far more animosity on the other side.\nI mean, I don't know that such a person exists.\nAnd I should say yes, absolutely, I would. So let me say it that way, because that's a much more politically correct? Absolutely.\nBut it doesn't work that way, because it just doesn't, unfortunately. I really believe success. We were there. Everybody was working. Nobody's … Probably you, I don't know how you're doing now, but you were probably doing better four months ago.\nOkay. Well, you got in at the right time, but a lot of people with the 401(k), I mean, they're doing phenomenally. But a lot of people sold stock, and now they're saying, \"I missed it.\" I said to people, \"Don't sell. Just don't sell. Because the foundation is so strong, don't sell.\" But the people that really lost in terms of economic are the people that got out. The people that stayed in, they stayed with me, they're doing great, and we're almost at record highs.\nGo ahead. You can do it quickly, right?\nOh, he does, that's bad. That's too bad.\nIs he a good dad?\nGood.\nDon't worry about socially distancing.\nAnd you have a very talented son, good guy.\nHe's honest. You have an honest father.\nThat's no good.\nIt's great to see you.\nI'm going to put a lot of pressure on him. He'll call you today in a little while.\nThank you very much.\nGreat to meet you.\nHe was really good. I was really worried about that. He was nice.\nHe was nice. Dave, thank you very much.\nA great honor.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dave-portnoy-barstool-sports"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference on COVID-19 Vaccine Development at the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies Bioprocess Innovation Center in Morrisville, North Carolina", "Date": "2020-07-27", "Text": "Thank you very much. Great to be in this wonderful State. So many friends, so much success, and we love being here. And we're here, actually, today to discuss the exciting progress that we've achieved under the Operation Warp Speed, our historic initiative to develop, test, manufacture, and deliver a vaccine in record time. And that's what it is, in record time. Likewise, therapeutically, we are very, very advanced. You're hearing about it, and you'll be hearing about it a lot more in the next 2 weeks. We will achieve a victory over the virus by unleashing America's scientific genius, which is what it is.\nI'm therefore proud to announce that this morning, the Moderna vaccine has officially entered phase three already. And that's phase three clinical trials: the final stage before approval. There's never been anything like this, in terms of speed, nothing even close. A second vaccine is likely to enter phase three in a matter of days. Under Operation Warp Speed, we've shaved years off of the time that it takes to develop a vaccine—in some cases, many years—and we've done it while maintaining the FDA gold standard for safety. This is the fastest a vaccine for a novel pathogen has ever gone. It has never gone like this. And if you look at where we are, by phase three, we could say \"ever gone by far.\"\nFour additional promising candidates are expected to enter final trials in the coming weeks, including the Novavax vaccine being developed right here at this facility. It's an incredible facility. We're going to be making a tour in a little while—a very, very complete tour—with the folks that run it and the people that operate.\nWe've just completed a tour of Fujifilm's innovation laboratories—and that's going to be done at a much, much higher level in a few minutes after I'm finished, and I believe we'll take a few questions too—which were carrying out a crucial biomanufacturing process needed to make the Novavax vaccine. This production is made possible by my administration's $1.6 billion award to Novavax as part of Operation Warp Speed. It lets us deliver the final product in a time that never has been achieved anywhere, at any time, for anything like this.\nThese same manufacturing processes are being conducted on an even larger scale in College Station, Texas. Today I'm proud to announce that HHS has just signed a $265 million contract with the Fujifilm Texas A&M Innovation Center, which is quite the place, to dramatically expand their vaccine manufacturing capacity. I want to thank Fujifilm CEO Martin Meeson for welcoming us today. And Martin—where is, Martin? Thank you. Thank you very much, Martin. It's really wonderful to be with you under these circumstances in particular, with all the progress that's being made. As well as Novavax CEO Stanley Erck—Stanley, thank you very much. Thank you very much for being here.\nThanks also to Secretary Alex Azar, who is with us; Senator Thom Tillis, thank you very much. Thank you, Thom. Stand up, Thom. Good job you've done. Thank you very much. You really have. Representatives Richard Hudson, David Rouzer, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Greg Murphy, thank you. All friends. All warriors. Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who I hear is doing a great job—where is Dan? Stand up, Dan. Great job, Dan. Really good. North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore—thank you, Tim. Great job. And President pro tem of the North Carolina State Senate, Phil Berger. Thank you, Phil, very much. I appreciate it. Operation Warp Speed is funding a historic portfolio of highly promising vaccine candidates. In addition to our $1.6 billion investment in Novavax, we've issued a $483 million contract with Moderna, a $1.2 billion contract with AstraZeneca, a $465 million contract with Janssen, and just last week, a $1.95 billion agreement with Pfizer. Tremendous progress is being made with all of those great companies.\nOur groundbreaking agreement with Pfizer includes a guarantee to deliver 100 million doses shortly after the vaccine's approval—almost immediately—with the option to purchase an additional 500 million thereafter. Not only is Operation Warp Speed accelerating the development of a vaccine, we're also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing has happened like this since the end of World War II.\nInstead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously. So everything goes at one time. We're not waiting and waiting and waiting; it's all going at one time. We have a system that has—I think it's unparalleled. Never been done before, but we suspect it's going to work and work very well.\nWe're mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one that it's approved, it will be available to the American people immediately. And we'll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world. The world is suffering from this China virus.\nAnother dimension of Operation Warp Speed is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus. Over 140 clinical trials are underway, and a number of effective therapies have already been developed and widely delivered, including remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact—you see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically—dexamethasone, convalescent plasma, and antibody treatments. We have numerous treatments right now that are under study, and I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that.\nOn July 7, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. Late stage.\nDue to the medical advances we've already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85-percent lower than it was in April—think of that: 85 percent—and is 25-percent lower than Europe as a whole.\nIn the middle of April, more than 22 percent of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down—as of last week, it's dropped down to under 7 percent.\nTo decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing—very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They're pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than—substantially more than 50 percent.\nLast week, our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services began distributing rapid point-of-care diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.\nWhat we've already sent includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point-of-care tests. It's a tremendous amount. That's—you'll get your response and answer from 5 to 15 minutes.\nOver the next 3 weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point-of-care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That's more than all of Europe put together, times two. Nobody is even close. And as countries go, it is—as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. And we're going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people.\nThrough our relentless efforts, we've completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we've now distributed nearly 100 million N95 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face shields, and much, much more. In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month, and we're distributing—we have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need. Other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus.\nLast week, FEMA sent additional personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves, and 6 million gowns. It's a lot.\nOver the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas, and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona, they're heading very substantially down, and rapidly. We've been constant—and in constant communication with the States and are surging them resources when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full, we have everything we need, we get it to the States immediately, we deal with the Governors. The relationship with the Governors has been very good.\nThese States are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner and very, very quickly. We are working with every Governor and health commissioner across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each State, as well as tailored recommendations. States are different.\nMy administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections, by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America, however, the region's reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or undercounted. And I can say that's probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases; most of the world doesn't. They either don't do testing—therefore, they have very few cases, even though people are sick—or they just don't report it.\nGiven the reality of what we just said, we're focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly infected countries outside of our borders.\nI've spoken with Governor Abbott—terrific gentleman—and I can report that over 3,300 Federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We've given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We've supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators, and half a million KN90 masks.\nBeginning this week, Texas hospitals will receive 500 cases of remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients.\nIn addition to the cross-border spread, this stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease. We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance.\nI trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially—especially—focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars, and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions to shield those at highest risk, which are, in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them, and you want to guard them, and you want to protect them from the virus especially—especially those that are really targeted—almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic, pandemic.\nAmerica will develop a vaccine very soon, and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time. As our visit here demonstrates—and I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great State of North Carolina. This is a great place. It's a phenomenal place. And we've had so many great meetings and such a great time.\nI want to drive and to—the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I'm there, when they call—most of them, many of them are sitting here right now—I will always answer their call.\nSo thank you very much. I appreciate your being here with us. And let's get on to a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made, and it's been made rapidly, and it's been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before.\nSo please. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.\nWell, I think so. But you know, there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren't doing so well.\nWe're—you know, before—just before I left the White House, in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they're making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you, therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we'll have some, really, very good things to say. We're just having great answers.\nSo it is about that, and it's also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length is just coming along really well. And it's not just one company, it's many companies have had tremendous progress. So that will be announced over the next very short period.\nWell, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we're in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we're going to—in terms of the vaccine. I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning, you go, and you give somebody, whether it's transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal, and they heal quickly.\nSo we've had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at remdesivir and if you look at some of the other things. But we'll have some announcements on that over the next 2 weeks.\nYes, it is hope, but it's only hope, because we've gotten such incredible results, scientifically.\nWe don't talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion, and I think it was very productive.\nI don't think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We've set record job numbers. We've set record numbers. Whether it's a pure \"V\" or a little bit less than that, I think it's going to be very good.\nIf, therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you're going to have a tremendous recovery. Likewise, with the vaccines, if you do that by the end of the year, that's ahead of schedule—substantially ahead of schedule. And it's ahead of anything that's ever taken place, in terms of vaccines, before.\nSo I think if those things happen—if just one of those events happen, you'll go right back into that \"V,\" and I think you're probably in the \"V\" anyway.\nI really do believe a lot of the Governors should be opening up States that they're not opening, and we'll see what happens with them. But a lot will have to do with the fact that, therapeutically, I think you're going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise.\nYes, please. Go ahead, in the back.\nWell, we're actually coming to North Carolina, as you know. And we're having a very major—I guess that would be the nomination night, so that's Monday. That will be Monday—they're going to be here. And the rest we'll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing. And I'm really happy that we're going to be having a piece of it at least—and a very important piece—in North Carolina.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nI think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We're leading in North Carolina. We're leading in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Arizona—our numbers. We're leading in Arizona. We're leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We're leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it's a terrible thing when you look at it.\nBut I had the same thing 4 years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn't going to win any State, and I ended up winning every one of them, you know, the swing States. I wasn't going to win any of them, and I won all of them. And I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer. They have it closer, but it's the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing State and substantially in other States, by even more than I won in '16.\nWhen you look at Florida, as an example, you have thousands of boat out on—boats out in the ocean, out in the Intracoastal. You look at other States where, likewise, you have thousands of boats, and they're all waving the Trump sign—Trump-Pence sign—and they're so proud. Thousands and thousands. You've seen it—where you have Bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends.\nI think there's more spirit now than there's ever been for my campaign, and that includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there's more today, because what we've done, nobody has ever done before. Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes—the most in our history—created the greatest economy we've ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody has ever done, and all of these different things.\nThe VA—we got VA Choice. We got VA everything for the VA. Right now they had a 91-percent approval rating at—in a recent poll. I was just speaking to the Secretary—91 percent in the VA. That's never happened before.\nI think when people see all that we've done, even Space Force. We created a force, an actual—you know, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. Right? It's pretty amazing. Coast Guard. And now Space Force. That hasn't happened in 75 years. What we've done—working with some of those warriors over there, by the way—but what we've done has never been done.\nIf you look at Alaska with ANWR, one of the—perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton—everybody wanted to get it done; I got it done—ANWR in Alaska. Probably or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. No, what we've done has been incredible.\nRecently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic, and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. And by the way, gasoline prices for everyone are very, very low, in many cases, less than $2. That's pretty incredible.\nAnd I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone, and they cut way back. And we're now at $40-and-plus a barrel. And we're saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We're the number-one in energy in the world.\nSo with all that we've done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history. We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again. And everyone knows I'm going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn't close it, you would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more, than that—what you have.\nWe closed this greatest economy ever—far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs—they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they've had—think of it—in 67 years. We were having the best year we've ever had. I had to close it, and now we're reopening it. And next year, we'll be stronger. It will be the strongest year so far. It will be better, even than last year.\nOkay, thank you very much. I'll be heading back, and I'll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We're going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders.\nThank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-covid-19-vaccine-development-the-fujifilm-diosynth"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-07-28", "Text": "Thank you very much. Today my administration has taken a momentous step toward achieving American pharmaceutical independence—a very, very big, big step—a focus of our campaign to bring America's critical supply chains and medical manufacturing back to the U.S.A. We've been working on this for a long time.\nThis is a core of our strategy to protect our people from the horrible China virus. It should have never happened. It should have never been here. They should have stopped it.\nIn the decades before I took office, foreign nations were allowed to freely plunder our factories and loot our industries, take our business out of the United States. Millions of jobs were vacuumed out, just taken out so easily. Our politicians let that happen. And our communities were stripped and shipped, in many cases, to China and all over the world—countries all over the world.\nNearly 4 years ago, we launched a bold effort to revitalize American manufacturing, enact fair trade deals, and bring our industries back home where they belong. When the China virus landed on our shores, it became clearer than ever before that restoring American manufacturing is a core matter of national security. We must never be reliant on a foreign nation for America's medical or other needs, and that includes many other needs.\nI just want to say that Pfizer just announced, a little while ago, that they're combining phase two and phase three trials, and the vaccine looks like it's really heading in a very rapid direction, in a very positive direction. First time that's happened. And they're many months ahead of any other trial. There's never been anything like it. So it's the fastest ever, and to me, it's very exciting.\nToday I'm proud to announce one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries. My administration has reached a historic agreement with a great American company—you remember this company; it's called—from the good, old camera age, the old days—to begin producing critical pharmaceutical ingredients. It's called Kodak. And it's going to be right here in America.\nSo I want to congratulate the people in Kodak. They've been working very hard. Members of my administration are present in Rochester right now—Rochester, New York—good place. And they're trying to finalize this groundbreaking deal, and they will be announcing this deal.\nI want to thank Governor Andrew Cuomo and his representatives. We've worked really well together on this deal. It's a big deal. It's going to be a great deal and a great deal for New York and a great deal for Kodak.\nNinety percent of all prescriptions written in the United States are for generic drugs. We have approved more generic drugs than any other administration, by far. Generic drugs can be just as good as the brand names, but cost much less.\nYet, in less than 10 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients needed to make these drugs—they're currently manufactured in America—more than 50 percent, however, are made in India and China. And you'll be seeing—a lot of things have happened. It's been happening, but it's happening at a more rapid pace right now.\nWith this new agreement, my administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan to support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals. It's a great name, when you think of it. Such a great name. It was one of the great brands in the world. Then, people went digital, and Kodak didn't follow. But now, under very extraordinary leadership, they are following, and they're doing something that's a different field, and it's a field that they've really hired some of the best people in the world to be taking care of that company and watching that company—watching over it. But it's a breakthrough in bringing pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States.\nUnder this contract, our 33d use of the Defense Production Act—remember when you were saying I didn't use it enough, I didn't use it enough? And now you heard it's the 33d use. We don't talk about it all the time; we used it, and we used it as a little bit of a threat, frankly, with certain companies that weren't doing as we were asking them to do, and it came through as both a threat and a usage. But this is our 33d use of the Defense Production Act.\nKodak will now produce generic active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is a big deal. Using advanced manufacturing techniques, Kodak will also make the key starting materials that are the building blocks for many drugs in a manner that is both cost-competitive and environmentally safe. We'll be competitive with almost all countries and soon with all countries.\nOnce this new division is fully operational, in addition to all of the other plants that we've opened with other companies throughout the United States recently, it will produce as much as 25 percent of all active ingredients needed to make generic drugs in the U.S.A. That's a big number: 25 percent.\nThis agreement will directly create 360 new jobs at Kodak's factory in Rochester; that's just in the initial phase. And in Minneapolis, a place I have gotten to know very well, and it's a great place—and I'm very happy that we're able to help them with the problems that they've had recently. And the National Guard—I want to thank the National Guard, both State and beyond. I want to thank them for the incredible job. They went in, and they did some beautiful job. They cleaned it up. You didn't hear about the problems anymore.\nAnd indirectly, I want to create—we created thousands more jobs all across our pharmaceutical supply chains. We have now been building a very big pharmaceutical supply chain—not only coming out of China, coming out of other countries also. I want to thank Peter Navarro, Adam Boehler, and Admiral Polowczyk for their tremendous work to make this deal possible.\nToday's action is our latest step to build the greatest medical arsenal in history. We'll be able to do that. Through the Defense Production Act and other authorities, we have invested more than $3 billion in our Nation's industrial base. We've contracted with companies such as Ford, General Motors, Philips, and General Electric to produce more than 200,000 ventilators by the end of this year, nearly seven times more than we would ever do in a typical year.\nWe've contracted with Honeywell, 3M, O&M, Halyard, Moldex, and Lidl to increase U.S. production of N95 masks. And we've brought it from less than 40 million a month to over 100 million a month by August, and we'll have 160 million in a very short while, 160 million a month. That's many times what we used to do. If you go back 2 years ago, it's many, many times.\nWe're increasing domestic production of gloves by 1,000 percent. It's 1,000 percent. We will be manufacturing 450 million gloves annually by next year. We're finalizing contracts with our textile industry to make gowns in America with American fabric, which makes a lot of our businesses happy that produce the fabric. We have 13 million reusable gowns in the stockpile, and we'll continue to grow that number to 72 million this fall, which is a rapid escalation indeed.\nWe made major investments in new rapid point-of-care tests. So we have—there's nothing like the rapid point, where you get your answer in 5 minutes to 15 minutes to maybe 20, 25 minutes at the max. And we're already at about a 50-percent level, and we're bringing it up very substantially from there.\nWe're growing domestic production from less than 250,000 test kits per month in May to 8 million test kits per month. There is nothing like this that has ever taken place anywhere in the world or close.\nThrough our partnership with Puritan Manufacturing in the State of Maine—a great State—we've increased production of test swabs from 30 million per month in June to 56 million per month now. As you remember, I went to Maine; I went to the plant where they do this. It was incredible. It was a great experience. And we'll produce over 100 million swabs per month by January.\nWe've dramatically ramped up production of materials needed for a vaccine and are on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as a vaccine is approved, which could be very, very soon, and 500 million doses shortly thereafter. So we'll have 500 million doses. And logistically, we're using our military, our great military—a group of people; their whole life is based around logistics and bringing things to and from locations—and they'll be able to take care of this locationally and bringing it where it has to go very, very quickly. They're all mobilized. It's been fully set up.\nA very, very talented general is in charge. And when we have that vaccine, it will be discharged and taken care of. It will be a very rapid process all over the country. And perhaps we'll be supplying a lot of the vaccine to other parts of the world, like we do with ventilators and other things that we, all of a sudden, have become very good at making.\nWhen the China virus struck our Nation, we mobilized the entire Government and the private sector to acquire, source, and deliver lifesaving supplies. HHS, FEMA, and the private sector combined have coordinated the delivery of more than 196 million N95 respirators, 815 million surgical masks, 20 million gloves, 34 million face shields, and 354 million gowns. That's a lot of gowns.\nLast week, FEMA completed a second shipment of personal protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes in the United States. Our big focus has been on nursing homes and senior citizens. As you know, that's where we want to take care—we have to take care of the most vulnerable, especially if they have a medical difficulty, a medical problem—in particular, heart or diabetes. Which provided a total of 1.2 million pairs of protective eyewear, 14 million masks, 66 million pairs of gloves, and 13 million gowns.\nWe have replenished the long-neglected National Stockpile. In January, the stockpile had 17.9 million N95 masks. Today, the stockpile has over 50 million N95 masks, and we'll be doubling that in a very short period of time and then doubling that number.\nWe've shipped more than 14,000 ventilators to areas of need across the country, and we've more than 75,000 available to deploy. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. And if you remember, early on, when we were first hit with the virus, ventilators were very hard to come by, and now we're the largest maker anywhere in the world, by far. And not only are we fully supplied and stocked, but we're helping other nations, because ventilators are hard to build and hard to get.\nThis is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will continue the largest onshoring campaign in American history. We will bring back our jobs, and we will make America the world's premier medical manufacturer and supplier. That's what's happening already. It's been happening now for quite some time. We're seeing improvements across the major metro areas and most hotspots. You can look at large portions of our country; it's corona-free. But we are watching very carefully California, Arizona, Texas, and most of Florida. It's starting to head down in the right direction, and I think you'll see it rapidly head down very soon. But if you look, California, Arizona, Texas, and, for the most part, most of Florida, it's starting to head down.\nIn the wake of the recent mass gatherings Americans have witnessed in the streets of Portland and Seattle, we are also tracking a significant rise in cases in both metropolitan areas because of what's been going on.\nAnd we, as you know, have done a excellent job of watching over Portland and watching our courthouse where they wanted to burn it down. They're anarchists. Nothing short of anarchists, agitators. And we have protected it very powerfully. And if we didn't go there, I will tell you, you wouldn't have a courthouse. You'd have a billion-dollar burned-out building.\nWe're also working aggressively to combat the virus and Native American and Alaska Native communities. Under the CARES Act, we provided $8 billion to address the coronavirus in Tribal communities, and we've worked very hard with Tribal communities. They're very vulnerable to this horrible plague. That's the largest investment in Indian Country in U.S. history. There's never been an investment that big in Indian Country.\nWe need every American to help protect our fellow citizens and prevent the spread of the disease. It's critical that younger Americans remember that even though they are at lower risk—and, in fact, some are in—some age groups are at an extraordinary low risk themselves—they can unknowingly spread the virus to others who are at higher risk.\nI ask all Americans, regardless of background or age, to practice social distancing, which people have gotten very used to, but we have to keep doing it; remain vigilant about hygiene; avoid indoor gatherings and large gatherings, but especially indoor, especially where you have crowded bars; and that you wear a mask whenever appropriate.\nThrough the genius of our scientists, the devotion of our doctors, the skill of our workers, and the dedication of our people, we will achieve victory over the virus and emerge stronger than ever before.\nWe're looking at a very powerful year next year, economically. The job numbers are looking outstanding, to put it mildly; set records. The numbers on retail—retail sales—came in 2 weeks ago at the highest number in the history of our country. So we look like we're heading to some very, very good economic times; that means jobs, that means stock market.\nThe stock market is already doing very well. It's getting to a point very close to where it was when we had this—when we were hit with the plague. So I just want to thank everybody for being here.\nSteve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please. Go ahead.\nWe'll be doing a speech on Thursday—the main speech, the primary speech. Charlotte—they will be doing—nominating on Monday. That's a different period, a different thing happening, but they'll be doing nominations on Monday. I speak on Thursday. Okay?\nWe'll go—we'll be announcing it soon. We'll be announcing it soon.Q.So you could be going to Charlotte?\nAnybody have any ideas? We'll be announcing it very soon.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nYes, there are actually, and we'll be talking about it. There are, you know, also things that I very much support, but we'll be negotiating. It's sort of semi-irrelevant because the Democrats come with their needs and asks, and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved. Kevin has been very active, as you know—all of the people involved. Steve Mnuchin has done a great job, keeps everybody together, both Democrat and Republican.\nAnd we'll see. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things. All right?\nWell, that was—I wasn't making claims. The—it's recommendations of many other peoples and—people, including doctors. Many doctors think it is extremely successful—the hydroxychloroquine—coupled with the zinc and perhaps the azithromycin. But many doctors think it's extremely good, and some people don't. Some people—I think it's become very political.\nI happen to believe in it. I would take it. As you know, I took it for a 14-day period, and I'm here. Right? I'm here. I happen to think it's—it works in the early stages. I think frontline medical people believe that too—some, many. And so we'll take a look at it.\nBut the one thing we know: It's been out for a long time, that particular formula, and that's what—essentially, what it is, the pill. And it's been for malaria, lupus, and other things.\nIt's safe. It doesn't cause problems. I had no problem. I had absolutely no problem, felt no different. Didn't feel good, bad, or indifferent. I—and I tested, as you know. It didn't get me, and it's not going to, hopefully, hurt anybody.\nSo we know from that standpoint—because it's been so many years, from a safety standpoint, it's safe. I happen to think, based on what I've read—I've read a lot about hydroxy. I happen to think that it has an impact, especially at the early years. There were some very good tests at Ford, and the doctor from Yale came up with a very, very strong testament to it. There was a group of doctors yesterday, a large group that were put on the internet, and for some reason, the internet wanted to take them down and took them off. I guess Twitter took them off and I think Facebook took them off. I don't know why. I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it, that she's had tremendous success with it. And they took her——\n——they took her voice off. I don't know why they took her off, but they took her off. Maybe they had a good reason, maybe they didn't. I don't know.\nI can only say that, from my standpoint, and based on a lot of reading and a lot of knowledge about it, I think it could have a very positive impact in the early stages. And I don't think you lose anything by doing it other than, politically, it doesn't seem to be too popular. You know why? Because I recommend it. When I recommend something, they like to say, \"Don't use it.\"\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci/Federal Coronavirus Response\nNo, not at all. I think—I don't even know what his stance is on it. I was just—you know, he was at the—he was at the Task Force meeting a little while ago.\nI have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. You know, it's sort of interesting—we've listened to Dr. Fauci. I haven't always agreed with him, and it's, I think, pretty standard. That's okay. He did not want us to ban our—this—this—put up the ban to China, when China was heavily infected—very badly, Wuhan. He didn't want to do that, and I did. And other things. And he told me I was right, and he told me I saved tens of thousands of lives, which was generous, but it's—you know, I think it's fact that I banned—I did the ban on Europe. But I get along with him very well and I agree with a lot of what he's said.\nSo—you know, it's interesting: He's got a very good approval rating, and I like that. I—it's good. Because remember, he's working for this administration. He's working with us, John. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn't have to be Dr. Fauci. He's working with our administration. And, for the most part, we've done pretty much what he and others—Dr. Birx and others, who are terrific—recommended.\nAnd he's got this high approval rating, so why don't I have a high approval rating with respect—and the administration, with respect to the virus? We should have a very high, because what we've done in terms of—we're just reading off about the masks and the gowns and the ventilators and numbers that nobody has seen, and the testing at 55 million tests; we tested more than anybody in the world. I have a graph that I'd love to show you—perhaps you've seen it—where we're up here and the rest of the world is down at a level that's just a tiny fraction of what we've done, in terms of testing.\nSo it sort of is curious: A man works for us—with us, very closely, Dr. Fauci, and Dr. Birx also highly thought of. And yet they're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all.\nGo ahead.\nWe're going to work with a lot of people on DACA, and we're also working on an immigration bill, a merit-based system, which is what I've wanted for a long time.\nThat decision was an interesting decision, because it gave the President, as a President, more power than many people thought the President had. So the President is now, which happens to be me, in a position where I can do an immigration bill and a health care bill and some other bills. And you've seen some of them come along.\nWe're going to do tremendous—we just signed it 3 days ago—we're doing tremendous prescription drug price reductions. Tremendous. It could be over 50 percent—whether it's favored nations clauses or anything else. I mean, it's tremendous numbers we're talking about.\nYou know, you go to some countries, and they'll sell, like, a pill for 10 cents, and in the United States, it costs $2. And it's the same basic factory. It's the same everything. The United States bears the cost of all of these low prices that you see all over the world where people go to Canada to buy a prescription drug from the United States. Not going to happen with me. It's not going to happen with me.\nSo, John, I think one of the exciting things—got very little coverage, and that's okay, but the people understand it—I think we will be reducing prescription drug prices by massive amounts, numbers that have never been done before.\nOther thing: In 51 years, we got—as you know, last year, drug prices came down. First time in 51 years that they came down. Now, with what I signed last week, I think that drug prices can come down by numbers like 50 percent and even greater, in certain instances.\nWe are going to make DACA happy and the DACA people and representatives happy, and we're also going to end up with a fantastic merit-based immigration system.\nWell, I said there would be a meeting—yes, a meeting sometime this week. Yes. They want to meet. I mean, I don't know that it was canceled. They want to meet. I thought the meeting was actually scheduled for tomorrow.\nI thought—I thought the meeting was scheduled tomorrow. Sorry about the dates. But you know, I see how upset you are by it.\nBloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg. You look like Mr. Bloomberg. Go ahead.\nI think you look much better, actually.\nWe'll do something. We're going to take care of the people. Yes. It's a good question. We're going to take care of the people.\nWell, maybe it's a saying, maybe it's not.\nBut I can—I can tell you this: She was on air, along with many other doctors. They were big fans of hydroxychloroquine, and I thought she was very impressive in the sense that, from where she came——\n——I don't know which country she comes from, but she said that she's had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients. And I thought her voice was an important voice, but I know nothing about her.\nGo ahead.\nOkay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1246"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-07-30", "Text": "Thank you very much. Let me begin by expressing our sadness at the passing of a wonderful man and a dear friend of mine, Herman Cain. He was a very special person. I got to know him very well. And unfortunately, he passed away from the thing called the China virus. And we send our prayers to Herman's great wife Gloria. Wonderful family.\nAnd I have to say, America grieves for all of the 150,000 Americans who had their lives taken by this horrible, invisible enemy. We mourn their loss, as a nation; we mourn their loss, as people, as people that love one another. And we're working very hard to not only contain this horrible event, this horrible plague—it's what it is, is a plague—but also to come up with therapeutics and vaccines. And we're making a lot of strides.\nAll over the world, they're having tremendous problems. A resurgence has taken place in many countries that people thought were doing well. Despite a wide range of approaches to the pandemic between countries, this resurgence in cases is occurring throughout large portions of our planet—in Japan, China, Australia, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Hong Kong—places where they thought it was—they had really done great. It came back. And in a couple of cases, it came back very strongly.\nThe virus was said to be under control, but new cases have risen very significantly once again. So when you think somebody is doing well, sometimes, you have to hold your decision on that; you have to hold your statement.\nSince the beginning of June, daily new cases have increased by a factor of 14 times in Israel; 35 times—that's 35 times—in Japan; and nearly 30 times in Australia, just to name a few. These were countries that were doing incredibly well; leadership was being praised. Latin America now leads the world in confirmed infections. And with the scarcity of testing in Latin America, the true numbers—you have no idea what they might be. And I can say \"scarcity of testing.\" Almost anywhere, except for our country.\nThis disease is highly contagious and presents unique challenges to our border States. Meanwhile, States like California, Washington State, Maryland, Virginia, Nevada, Illinois, Oregon, and many others, they were thought to be doing well, and they had a big resurgence and were hit very hard.\nAnd Governors that were extremely popular are not so popular anymore. They were held up as models to follow, and then they got hit and—now, I'm not even saying this is their fault. It's probably not their fault. It's just the way it is. That's the way it is. Highly infectious, one of the most infectious diseases that anybody has ever seen. Not since 1917, over a hundred years ago, has anyone seen anything like what we're witnessing now.\nBut these states have also seen the virus substantially rebound. And, again, no one is immune. No one is immune. These facts illustrate the imposing determinant—and it is a determinant—that a blanket shutdown to achieve a temporary reduction in cases is certainly not a viable long-term strategy for any country. People are starting to understand the disease now. We certainly have understood a lot about the disease that we didn't have any idea. We didn't—nobody ever saw anything like this. The primary purpose of a shutdown was to flatten the curve, ensure sufficient hospital capacity, and develop effective treatments and therapies to reduce mortality. And we've done that. But it can come rearing back when you least suspect it.\nWe did the right thing initially. We saved millions of lives, what we did. We did the right thing. But a permanent shutdown would no longer be the answer at all. A small shutdown of certain areas—but we don't want to do that—small shutdowns can be very helpful, but not for long periods of time. We understand what we're dealing with now, but it's a very complex situation. And I can only say, thank Heaven that we are so advanced in what we're doing, in terms of vaccines and therapies.\nWe now know a great deal about the virus and how to treat it and who it targets. Almost half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population. Think of it: Half of the deaths—really, a tremendous number—half of the deaths come from less than 1 percent of our population: those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The average age of those who die from the illness is 78.\nWe've announced very strong measures to protect those who are most vulnerable. The scientific path forward is to protect those at highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to carefully return to work and to school with appropriate precautions.\nI'm once again urging the American people to protect their dear family and friends and anybody who's elderly, especially if somebody is elderly and they have heart problems, if they have certain illnesses. Diabetes is a very bad one, having to do with what we're discussing. But you want to protect the elderly and socially distance, wear a mask if you cannot socially distance, and practice vigorous hygiene.\nEveryone, even healthy young people, should be taking extraordinary care to avoid infecting those at the highest risk from this terrible disease. The elderly and those with chronic health issues have to be protected.\nIn the current hotspots across the Sun Belt, the data is showing very encouraging signs. Arizona, in particular, has crossed an important threshold. For every person with the virus, we're now seeing an average of less than one additional person infected. And the numbers are coming down and coming down very substantially. They're starting to come down in Florida. Arizona is really leading away.\nI was in Texas yesterday, and they're starting to come down significantly, we believe, in Texas. Need another few days to figure that one out, but it looks like they're coming down very significantly.\nEarlier today I visited the Red Cross headquarters to discuss plasma therapy—which is a tremendous—a tremendous thing that they're looking at, and they have a lot of experience with it—potentially lifesaving treatments that infuse sick patients with powerful antibodies donated by those who have recovered successfully from this disease.\nMore than 2 million Americans have recovered from the virus, and today we're asking them to visit coronavirus.gov—coronavirus.gov—and volunteer to donate plasma. We need plasma. It's something that's been very effective, and we need plasma from those that were infected and successfully recovered, as most people do. Most people do.\nPlasma is one of the many promising treatments my administration is accelerating. We've secured over 90 percent of the world's supply of remdesivir—which is terrific—an encouraging antiviral drug that can effectively block replication of the virus. We've also approved the use of the widely-available steroid—which has been very successful—dexamethasone, which has shown success, even in patients at more advanced stages of the disease. On July 17, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to build manufacturing plants and hundreds of thousands of doses of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late-stage clinical trials, moving along very rapidly. That's Regeneron.\nAs a result of such significant strides in treatment, the mortality rate in those over the age of 18 is 85-percent lower than it was just in April. So in a very short period of time. Think of that: Just 18—85-percent lower than it was in April. It's a big statement.\nNow I want to provide an update on our efforts to ensure a strong economic comeback, including our negotiations on Capitol Hill. Throughout this crisis, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to rescue American workers. We love our American workers. And we've set records on job creation—records—2 months in a row.\nWe enacted a $3 trillion economic relief package. The Paycheck Protection Program alone saved over 50 million jobs. We delivered $300 billion to direct cash payments to Americans. We approved $500 billion for our hardest hit industries—$500 billion. We allowed struggling homeowners to reduce or defer their mortgage payments, and we put a nationwide moratorium on evictions from federally backed properties. It was a big thing, a very big thing. We also suspended student loan payments for 6 months, and we're looking to do that additionally and for additional periods of time.\nAs a result of these extraordinary steps by the administration, we added a record 7 million jobs in the 2 months past alone. To ensure this comeback continues, which we think it will—we had a great foundation to build on. We were the strongest country in the world; nobody close. We were outdoing everybody from China.\nIf you remember, for many years, you heard that in 2019, China would surpass the United States. Well, it didn't. We gained on them very significantly. We took it to a level that nobody has ever seen—2019, and we'll be back there very shortly. And it won't take very long, based on everything that we're seeing. It's not going to take very long. I think next year is going to be an excellent year, maybe one of our best years ever, from an economic standpoint.\nWe can never, ever forget the people that have been lost, and we never will. We'll never forget them; never forget what happened. This could have been stopped in China. They should have stopped it, and they didn't.\nBut I'm asking Congress to pass additional legislation to support Americans in need. First, we want a temporary extension of expanded unemployment benefits. This will provide a critical bridge for Americans who lost their jobs to the pandemic through no fault of their own. This was not anybody's fault. From the standpoint of jobs, it happened—a terrible thing happened. Could have been stopped. It happened.\nI want to thank Senate Republicans for fighting to extend unemployment benefits today—in the face of very strong Democrat obstruction, which I'm surprised at—because this is great for our country, and it's great for our workers, and it wasn't our workers' fault.\nSecond, we're asking Democrats to work with us to find a solution that will temporarily stop evictions. We do not want people who have lost their jobs due to the virus to be evicted from their homes or apartments. We don't want that to happen.\nThird, we need Democrats to join us to pass additional economic relief payments for American citizens, like the payments sent directly to 160 million Americans earlier this year, which was a tremendously successful program. This money will help millions of hard-working families get by.\nMy administration is also asking Democrats to work with us to pass $105 billion to help schools safely reopen. Children are not [Children are]* at the lowest risk. If you look at what's going on: the younger, the better. Amazing—the immune system. For children, the lower they are in age, the lower the risk, in terms of the age group itself.\nI tell the story that, in New Jersey, with thousands and thousands of people dying—sadly, dying—the Governor was telling me that only one—Phil Murphy—only one died under the age of 18. That's incredible. Where thousands of people that died in the State of New Jersey, one made an impact; one died under the age of 18.\nChildren are at the lowest risk of any age group from the virus. Indefinite school closures will inflict lasting harm to our Nation's children. We must follow the science and get students safely back to school, while protecting children, teachers, staff, and family. We have to remember that there's another side to this: Keeping them out of school and keeping work closed is causing death also. Economic harm, but it's causing death for different reasons. But death—probably more death.\nIf Governors do not want to open the public schools, the money should go to parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. So we say if a school doesn't want to open or if a Governor doesn't want to open—maybe for a political reason and maybe not, but there is some of that going on—the money should go to the parents so they can send their children to the school of their choice. If schools stay closed, the money should follow the students so families are in control of decisions about their sons and daughters, about their children.\nBut to pass a bill, Democrats must reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party. They have tremendous voices. They're looking at November 3. And probably a day later, they'll say, \"Let's open up the country.\" But the Democrats have to reject the extreme, partisan voices in their party so that we can get our country going even quicker than it's going right now. We have a lot opening, and we have a lot of States that you thought were doing pretty poorly, from the standpoint of the virus, and they're actually coming back very strong.\nThis pandemic has underscored the importance of economic policies that put American families and workers first. I got elected on the fact that I put America first. For many, many decades, in my opinion, we put America last. If you look at the crazy, horrible, disgraceful trade deals that we've watched for many years destroy our country—NAFTA, we terminated it. We have USMCA now, which is a great deal, and our farmers are doing really well despite the pandemic. But we put America first, America's families first, and America's workers first.\nBut that means bringing jobs and factories back to our shores, reducing unnecessary regulations, and creating new training opportunities for jobs and for the future. We've cut regulations at a level that no President has ever cut regulations. And we've cut taxes more than any President in the history of our country.\nAmericans always rise to the challenge, and we will emerge more resilient, more self-reliant, more independent, and more prosperous than ever before.\nSo I just want to thank you all. And if you'd like, we'll take a few questions.\nSteve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please.\nI just feel—I don't want a delay. I want to have the election. But I also don't want to have to wait for 3 months and then find out that the ballots are all missing and the election doesn't mean anything. That's what's going to happen, Steve. That's common sense, and everyone knows it. Smart people know it. Stupid people may not know it. And some people don't want to talk about it, but they know it.\nAnd no, we want to have an election where people actually go in and—\"What's your name?\" \"My name is so-and-so.\" Boom, you sign the book, like I've been doing for years.\nIt's very, very unfair to our country. If they do this, our country will be a laughingstock all over the world, because everyone knows it doesn't work.\nHow many ballots is he sending in California, as an example? Twenty-eight million or some massive number? Other States are sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, they've done it. They had experiments. They had news organizations experimenting.\nAnd look, read the story in the Washington Post about mail-in voting; it's a disaster. I'm very surprised to see that story, frankly, from them. The story is a disaster. So we're asking for a lot of trouble.\nAnd no, do I want to see a date change? No. But I don't want to see a crooked election. This election will be the most rigged election in history if that happens.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News].\nWell, we have many court cases, John. We have one that's been filed for a while now in Western Pennsylvania, as an example, on mail-in ballots.\nAnd by the way, John, we give tremendous examples, numbers of examples of all the fraud and all of the things that have taken place with respect to mail-in ballots.\nWell, it's had an interesting impact. I didn't know it was going to be the impact it had. What people are now looking at is: Am I right? But not me. Are all these stories right about the fact that these elections will be fraudulent, they'll be fixed, they'll be rigged? And everyone is looking at it, and a lot of people are saying, \"You know, that probably will happen.\"\nPlease, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News].Coronavirus Relief Legislation\nWell, it's a great question. I can't tell you, though, because that wouldn't be very smart from a negotiating standpoint. But we'll be putting certain things on the table.\nWe want to get money to people. It wasn't their fault. And we want to get money to people, and it has to be substantial. It's not their fault what happened.\nThe fact is, people don't like saying it—they know it's true—it's China's fault. Okay? It's not their fault. It's not the worker who lost his job; it's China's fault. And that's the way it is.\nOAN, please.\nSo our people have done—Homeland Security have done a fantastic job. They went to Oregon a little more than a week ago. The place was a mess. The city, Portland, was just a disaster. You see it, and a lot of people weren't reporting it right. They tried to pretend it was a protest, as opposed to anarchists and agitators. You understand what I'm saying. It's a mess.\nThey went there a short while ago, and they saved a Federal courthouse that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And they put a ring around the courthouse, and they saved it. But the group that's there is basically meant to save buildings, and they were very strong, very powerful. And they didn't come out too often out of this cocoon that they built in order to save these very expensive, valuable, and psychologically important buildings—right?—like courthouses.\nThe Governor and the mayor, we've been dealing with them, and we think they don't know what they're doing, because this should not have been going on for 60 days. It's not our job unless, in case of emergency—which I consider now to be an emergency—it's not our job to go in and clean out the cities. That's supposed to be done by local law enforcement.\nYesterday the Governor worked a deal where they'll do it; we'll stand by, they'll do it—and that's good. That was very good, but she didn't report it that way. What she reported was totally different. She said, \"I think Trump wants to take over the country.\" It's crazy.\nSo what happened is, our people are staying there to see whether or not they can do it today and tomorrow. And if they don't do it, we will send in the National Guard and we'll take care of it. And we're telling, right now, these protesters—and many should be arrested, because these are professional agitators, these are professional anarchists; these are people that hate our country. We're telling them, right now, that we're coming in very soon, the National Guard. A lot of people. A lot of very tough people. And these are not people that just have to guard the courthouse and save it. These are people that are allowed to go forward and do what they have to do. And I think that makes the Governor's job and the mayor's job a lot easier. So they're working today and probably tomorrow to clean out this beehive of terrorists. And if they do it, I'm going to be very happy. And then, slowly, we can start to leave the city. If they don't do it, we'll be sending in the National Guard.\nSo can you assure anybody of anything? I do say, again: Young people are almost immune to this disease. The younger, the better, I guess. They're stronger. They're stronger. They have a stronger immune system. It's an incredible thing. Nobody has ever seen this before. Various types of flu will hurt young people more than older people.\nBut young people are almost immune. If you look at the percentage, it's a tiny percent of 1 percent. It's a tiny percent of 1 percent. So we have to have our schools open. We have to protect our teachers. We have to protect our elderly. But we do have to have our schools open.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nOh, I think you're seeing it, and I think you will see it. And one of the things that we've done that we're getting—and it hasn't been utilized fully yet—but we're all set to march when it comes to the vaccine.\n——and all of these great companies, and they're doing very well.\nAnd the delivery system is all set, logistically. We have a general that—that's all he does, is deliver things, whether it's soldiers or other items. And I think you're going to see something that's going to be spectacular.\nThe FDA has approved things at a rate that's a tiny fraction of what it would cost—what it would take during a—another administration, let's say.\nWe are way ahead on vaccines, way ahead on therapeutics. And when we have it, we're all set up with our platforms to deliver them very, very quickly. The vaccines are doing well, the therapeutics are doing well, and we're all set to deliver them as soon as we have them, and that's going to be very soon.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1247"}
{"Title": "Interview with Jonathan Swan of Axios", "Date": "2020-08-03", "Text": "Okay.\nThank you very much.\nSure.\nTo an extent. I also think in terms of the downside. I do. I've been given a lot of credit for positive thinking, but I also think about downside because only a fool doesn't.\nI think you have to have a positive outlook. Otherwise, you would have nothing without a positive outlook. I think we've done an incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from China coming in, meaning putting the ban on China, which frankly nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody because it was very early in January. Then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. When you put a ban on Europe, that's a big thing. We would have probably lost hundreds of thousands of lives more had I not done that.\nAnd all of the experts, every one of them, not one of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. Three months later, they're all saying, I'm glad you did it.\nLook, look.\nNobody knew what this thing was all about. This has never happened before. 1917, but it was a totally different, it was a flu in that case. Okay? But other than 1917, there's never been anything like this. And by the way, if you watch the fake news on television, they don't even talk about it. But you know, there are 188 of the countries right now that are suffering, some proportionately far greater than we are. Okay? As bad as we are.\nSome proportionately greater than we are. Right now, right now, Spain is having a big spike. There are tremendous problems in the world. You look at Moscow, look at what's going on with Moscow. Look at Brazil, look at these countries what's going on. This was sent to us by China, one way or the other, and we're never going to forget it. Believe me, we're never going to forget it.\nAnd we were beating China at every single point. We were beating them on trade, we were making progress like nobody's ever made progress. Before the pandemic, they had the worst year, Jonathan, that they've had in 67 years. You know that. With the tariffs and everything else I did. We were taking in billions of dollars. I was giving some of it to the farmers. The farmers were doing well because they were targeting the farmers, I was targeting China. We were doing good.\nThen all of a sudden, the game changed, and I had to close it down. I closed down the greatest economy ever in history.\nWell, wait. And then, I closed it down. And now we're opening it. And we saved, by the way, by closing it down, we saved millions of lives. If we would have gone to herd and we knew very little about the disease, if we would've gone herd, we would have lost millions of people, millions of people. One person's too much. We're at 140,000 people. One person is too much. We're at 140. We would have lost millions of people. And those people that really understand it, they really understand it. They said, it's incredible the job that we've done. And again, I bring it up, the ban-\nWhat's that?\nNobody knew the extent. Nobody knew how contagious it was. You know What? Maybe China knew.\nBy the way, [crosstalk] Excuse me, Jonathan, we had a 19,000 seat stadium and first of all, we had 12,000 people, not 6,000, which you reported and other people reported. But you couldn't even get in. It was like an armed camp.\nExcuse me, wait. And Tulsa, well, because that area was a very good area at the time. It was an area that was pretty much over. [crosstalk] After, after, a month later, it started going up. That's a month later, but Tulsa was a very good, Oklahoma was doing very well as a state. It was almost free. It spiked a month later, a month and a half, two months later. But it was a good area.\nWe had a tremendous crowd, we had tremendous response. It was like an armed camp. You couldn't even get through. You couldn't get anybody in. But we had 12,000 people. It was incorrectly reported. The other thing we had that nobody wants to talk about, so Fox broadcast it. It was the highest rating in the history of Fox television Saturday night. It was the highest rating.\nWell, wait a minute. You're saying something. That speech was the highest rated speech in the history of Fox television on Saturday night. And nobody says that.\nI'm just saying this. I'm just saying this. At the time… And I canceled another one. I had to cancel it and we were going to have a great crowd in New Hampshire, and I canceled it for the same reason.\nWell, what's your definition of control?\nYeah. Under the circumstances right now, I think it's under control. I'll tell you what-\nThey are dying. That's true. And it is what it is. But that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we can. It's under control as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us.\nWell, I'll tell you, I'd like to know if somebody… First of all, we have done a great job. We've gotten the governors everything they needed, they didn't do their job. Many of them didn't and some of them did. Someday we'll sit down. We'll talk about the successful ones, the good ones. Look at that smile. The good ones and the bad. We had good and bad. And we had a lot in the middle, but we had some incredible governors. I could tell you right now who the great ones are and who the not so great ones are, but the governors do it. We gave them massive amounts of material.\nBy the way, not get worse like the original flow. You understand that.\nBut If you look, Arizona's going down. Texas is going down, and Florida is going down.\nNo, I'm not going to get bored. I never get bored of talking about this, it's too big a thing.\nAnd again, it should have been stopped by China, and it wasn't.\nWe have it here.\nNo, I think I'm very consistent. No, this is a very serious thing. We have 140,000 people at this moment.\nThis is a very, very serious situation. And what you have to do, is handle it the best it can be handled. And again, I'm working with the governors. I got them tremendous amounts of equipment that they would have never gotten. Jonathan, they wouldn't have equipment now, if I didn't get.\nWell, we have great testing. We're doing and many other people do-\nLet me explain the testing. We have tested more people than any other country, than all of Europe put together times two. We have tested more people than anybody ever thought of. India has 1.4 billion people. They've done 11 million tests. We've done 55, it'll be close to 60 million tests. And there are those that say, you can test too much. You do-\nAnd there are those that say you can test too much. You do know that.\nOh, just read the manuals, read the books.\nRead the books. Read the books.\nLet me explain. What testing does, it shows cases. It shows where there may be cases. Other countries test… you know when they test? They test when somebody is sick. That's when they test. And I'm not saying they're right or wrong. Nobody has done it like we've done it. We've gotten absolutely no credit for it. But we've come up with so many different tests. The only thing that we have now is some people have to wait longer than we'd like them to. We want it-\nWe want point to point. We want to have a five minute to a 15 minute test.\nAnd, from what I understand, we're close to 50% where it's point to point tests. We are making thousands of instruments, thousands of tests right now, tens of thousands that can be distributed to various parts of the country. But you have to understand. And we've even sent some of them to other countries where they had a big problem. Jonathan, almost 50%, in fact, I think the number might be over, is immediate testing. The other is tough. You take a test. You have to send it to a laboratory. Let's say that takes a day. Let's say it's a day.\nSo, it's three, or four, or five days.\nThere is nothing you can do about that.\nI think that you will have that relatively soon. I mean-\nYou already have half.\nI would much rather get back to you.\nBecause I don't want to have you write in one month, I didn't make it.\nI missed it by a day.\nAnd it's a headline.\nExcuse me. One thing I would say about testing.\nBecause we test so much, we show cases. So, we show many, many cases. We show tremendous number of cases. I know you're smiling when I say that, but I'm telling you.\nI know. Other countries don't test like we do. So, they don't show case.\nWe're testing so much because we had the ability to test.\nJonathan, we didn't even have a test. When I took over, we didn't even have a test. Now, in all fairness-\nExcuse me. I was going to say-\nThere was no test for this. We didn't have a test because there was no test.\nAnd, in a very short order, we got one test. We got another test.\nWe got another. Many of those tests are now obsolete because it's called science.\nAnd, all of a sudden, something is better. But, because we tested so many people, 55, 60 million people, very soon, we get cases. You test. Some kid has even just a little runny nose. It's a case. And then, you report many cases. So, we look like we have more cases than massive countries like China, which by the way, doesn't report, as you know.\nNo. No. The point is-\nThe point is, because we are so much better at testing than any other country in the world, we show more cases.\nOkay. No, no.\nLet's look. Let's look.\nTake a look at some of these charts.\nWe're going to look.\nHere is one. Well, right here, United States is lowest in numerous categories. We're lower than the world.\nWe're lower than Europe.\nLook. Take a look. Right there. Here is case death.\nYou can't do that.\nYou have to go by where… look. Here is the United States. You have to go by the cases. The cases are there.\nThe people that live from those cases.\nNo. Because you have to go by the cases.\nYou don't know that.\nYou don't know that.\nI won't get into that because I have a very good relationship with the country.\nBut you don't know that. And they have spikes. Look, here's one of-\nHere's one. Here's one right here, United States.\nYou take the number of cases.\nNow look, we're last meaning we're first.\nWe have the best.\nTake a look again. It's cases.\nAnd we have cases because of the testing.\nNo, but you're not reporting it correctly, Jonathan.\nIf you take a look at this other chart… look, this is our testing. I believe this is the testing. Yeah.\nNo, wait a minute. Well, don't we get credit for that? And, because we do more tests, we have more cases. In other words, we test more. We have… now, take a look. The top one, that's a good thing not a bad thing. But the top… Jonathan-\nIf you watch the news or read the papers, they usually talk about new cases, new cases, new cases.\nWell, you look at death.\nDeath is way down from where it was.\nDeath… excuse me. Where it was is much higher than where it is right now.\nIt spiked, but now it's going down again.\nIt's gone down in Arizona. It's going down in Florida.\nIt's going down in Texas. Take a look at this. These are the tests.\nYeah. It leveled out and it's going down. That's my report, as of yesterday.\nIt is going down in Arizona. It is gong down in Texas.\nAnd it is spiked. It spiked and is now going down in Florida. It's evened out and going down in Florida.\nBut you have to look at this. This is the number of tests compared to the rest of the world.\nRight. And, because we've done more tests, we have more cases.\nNow, you can take them back. Check it out in your office.\nRight. Right.\nNo. That was a phone call to discuss other things. And frankly, that's an issue that many people said was fake news.\nI think a lot of people. If you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush Administration, some of them, not any friends of mine, were saying that it's a fake issue. But a lot of people said, it's a fake issue.\nBut we had a call. We had a call talking about nuclear proliferation.\nWhich is a very big subject where they would like to do something. And so would I. We discussed numbers things. We did not discuss that. No.\nI have never discussed it with him. No. I would. I'd have no problem with it.\nIt's interesting. Nobody ever brings up China. They always bring Russia, Russia, Russia. If we can do something with Russia in terms of nuclear proliferation, which is a very big problem.\nBigger problem than global warming.\nA much bigger problem than global warming in terms of the real world, that would be a great thing. No. It never reached my desk.\nYou know why? Because intelligence, they didn't think it was real.\nThey didn't think it was worthy. I wouldn't mind. If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it. It never reached my desk because-\nI do.\nI read it a lot.\nI read a lot. They like to say I don't read. I read a lot.\nI comprehend extraordinarily well, probably better than anybody that you've interviewed in a long time. I read a lot. I spend a lot of time at meetings. Usually it's once a day or at least two or three times a week, intelligence meetings.\nTalking about India, talking about the problems with China.\nTalking about so many different elements of the world.\nThe world is a very angry place, if you look all over the world. We call up. I see a 22 soldiers were killed in India with China fighting over the border. It's been raging for many, many decades. And they've been fighting and back and forth. I have so many briefings on so many different countries, but this one didn't reach my desk.\nWell, we sold them weapons when they were fighting Russia too. When they were fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan-\nWell, it's a different… I'm just saying. Yes.\nI'm just saying we did that too.\nI don't know. I didn't ask Nicholson about that. He was there for a long time. Didn't have great success because he was there before me. And then, ultimately, I made a change.\nI don't know. When you say arming is-\nI have heard that but, again, it's never reached my desk.\nHey, Russia doesn't want anything to do with Afghanistan. Let me just say about Russia. Russia used to be a thing called the Soviet Union. Because of Afghanistan, they went bankrupt. They became Russia, just so you do understand. Okay? The last-\nWent bankrupt, they became Russia, just so you do understand, okay? The last thing that Russia wants to do is get too much involved with Afghanistan. They tried that once. It didn't work out too well.\nAnd by the way, we're largely out of Afghanistan, as you probably know.\nNo, you're wrong. No.\nOkay. Are you ready?\nWe'll be down in a very short… It's already planned.\nLet me explain. We'll be down in a very short period of time to 8,000, then we're going to be down to 4,000. We're negotiating right now. We've been there for 19 years.\n19 years.\nWe'll be getting out.\nWe'll be at 4,000. I'll get you the exact-\nVery soon. Very soon.\nVery soon. Yeah, very soon.\nI don't want to tell you that. I don't want to tell you.\nWhat is? That is [crosstalk]\nProbably anywhere from four to 5,000.\nNo, it's not. We had-\nWe had much more. We had a lot of people over there too.\nA lot of people. And we did a good job. We wiped out ISIS. Let me just tell you what you don't see.\nWe took out, in Syria, we took out ISIS. We a hundred percent of the caliphate. When I took over Obama, it was totally rampant. ISIS was all over the place. We took them out. We captured them. We killed them a hundred percent, not 99%. I wanted to get out at 99. Everyone said, \"Oh, please, would you stay?\" I stayed. 99% was good, but a hundred percent of the caliphate.\nWe took out Soleimani. We took out al-Baghdadi. We took out people that nobody thought possible. Al-Baghdadi was the biggest terrorist of them all. They couldn't find him. I took him out. Soleimani, even bigger. I took him out. I've done things that no other president's done. None. I mean, fortunately, not too many. They should have never been in the Middle East. The decision to go to the Middle East and get into the Middle East was the single biggest mistake made in the history of our country. That's my opinion.\nWell, Hillary Clinton never accepted them.\nI mean, she doesn't accept them and she got beaten very easily.\nGrumbled? Grumbled? She wrote books about it.\nAnd don't use the word grumbled.\nShe wrote books about it.\nShe got beaten easy.\n306 to 223. That's a lot. That's a lot.\nI'll tell you what it looks like.\nLet me tell you what it looks.\nSo we have a new phenomena. It's called mail-in voting, where you send, where a governor-\nIn terms of kind of the kind of millions and millions of ballots. They've never done anything like that.\nBigger? Not bigger, massively bigger.\nSo they're going to send tens of millions of ballots to California, all over the place, to who's going to get them. I have a friend who lives in Westchester County-\nHis son passed away. He had a beautiful, wonderful son. Young man. Passed away seven years ago. He called me, he said, \"I just got a ballot for my son, Robert.\"\n\"He died seven years ago.\" Somebody got at ballot for a dog. Somebody got a ballot for something else. You got millions of ballots going, nobody even knows where they're going. You look at some of the corruption having to do with universal mail-in voting… Absentee voting is okay. You have to apply, you have to go through a process.\nAbsentee voting is good. Look, you're sending it out-\nGovernors, millions of ballots. There is-\nThere is no way you can go through a mail-in vote without massive cheating.\nGo ahead.\nCorrect.\nLet me tell you. We have no choice.\nLet me tell you. You ready?\nWe have no choice because right now, we have, but we have many court cases that we're waiting. We have one filed in Western Pennsylvania. We have many court cases where we're trying to end it. We went through World War I, you went to the polls, you voted, we went through World War II, you went to the polls, you voted.\nAnd now because of the China virus, we're supposed to stay home, send millions of ballots all over the country, millions and millions. You know, you could have a case where this election won't be decided on the evening of November 3rd.\nIt could be decided many months later.\nYou know why? Because lots of things will happen during that period of time. Especially when you have tight margins, lots of things can happen. There's never been anything like this when you try… Now, of course, right now, we have to live with it, but we're challenging it in many courts, as you know, all over the country.\nWas either killed or committed suicide in jail. She's now in jail. Yeah, I wish you well, I'd wish you well, I'd wish a lot of people well. Good luck. Let them prove somebody was guilty. I mean, you do know that she [crosstalk]\nWell, her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happened? Was it suicide? Was he killed? And I do wish her well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her. I'm not looking bad for anybody. And they took that and made it such a big deal-\nBut all it is is her boyfriend died. He died in jail. Was he killed? Was it suicide? I do, I wish her well.\nNo, no, no, no, no, no. No. No.\nhere you go, the fake news.\nNo, no.\nFor 59 days, these people were anarchists and agitators, and some protesters, but these were anarchists. These people were beating the hell out of the city. They were beating up our federal buildings and our federal courthouse. We told the police to stop it. You make sure. And the police wouldn't do it. Not the police-\nExcuse me.\nInstead of Antifa.\nIt's Antifa and anarchists that are causing the problems, not law enforcement. Our law enforcement, if we didn't have people at our courthouse, and they're strong, tough people, and they don't want… They try and be very good, believe me. But if we didn't have people there, you would have your federal courthouse, a $600 million building, you would have that thing burned to the ground right now.\nOkay, let me tell you about unmarked.\nWell let me tell you about unmarked.\nFirst of all, these are Homeland Security people. They're securing a courthouse.\nThey're Homeland Security.\nBorder, hopefully they have ICE in there.\nHopefully they have ICE. Now, do you know why they're unmarked?\nBecause these terrorists, these Antifa people, these people that are at anarchists and agitators, when they see the name on a uniform of a person, a policeman or a law enforcement person, they find out where that person lives. And then they go and they scare the hell out of the person's family. And so they do it for that reason. It's just common… There's nothing secret about this. And you know it.\nYou see what's going on right now. We have Chad Wolf. They have people. He's doing a fantastic job. He's the acting head. He's doing a fantastic job. Chad Wolf has pickets and very dangerous looking people outside of his house. He's going to be just fine. He's tough and he's got people, but if you have the names on all of these uniforms, you'll have these maniacs in front of their houses, scaring their family and their wives or husbands, whatever it may be. I think it's a very good reason not to have your name. Why should you have identification? \"My name is Bill Smith and here's where I live and I'm a member of-\"\nNo, no, that's a serious concern.\nWhy? Why are they being detained?\nYou know why? You know why they're being detained? Well, [crosstalk].\nWell, I haven't seen the result yet. Let me see the result.\nI think Antifa should be investigated, not the law enforcement. They're investigating, think of [crosstalk]\nHave you been watching television?\nHave you been seeing the violence?\nNow, if you watch NBC News like I watch NBC fake news. I'm watching it. Lester Holt, real beauty. I'm watching this NBC News sham, and you have a mayor named Wheeler and he's standing out there and he's being accosted by the people. You know that. I mean, it's horrible what they're doing to him in Portland, the mayor of Portland and he thought he'd go out. He'd be a man.\nWhat they were doing and saying, and everything else to him, I happened to watch it on a different station. He had to get out. He had five security guards.\nHe got out with his life. Okay.\nWait. If you watch NBC News, they make them like he's standing there bravely fighting with the people, in a positive sense, that everything is wonderful.\nActually, it's getting better. We had a very good… We've arrested a lot of people and we now have a 10 year rule. You try not to knock down our courthouse-\nYou touch our courthouse, you go to jail for 10 years.\nThese are Democrat-run cities.\nAnd they're doing it for political reasons.\nI have.\nCriminal justice reform, opportunity.\n… pigs in a blanket, burn them like bacon. That was the first time I ever of Black… That was three, four years ago. Pigs meaning policemen. Pigs is what they're referring to, in a blanket, fry them like bacon. So I got off to a bad start. I got off to a very bad start.\nAnd so did [crosstalk].\nI would. But I think right now when they paint-\n… the sign. Nobody's asked for a meeting, right? I've never been, nobody's ever asked me for a meeting. Let me tell you with African Americans, I'm doing very well. They had the best employment numbers they've ever had. They had the best job numbers they've ever had. They were making more money than they ever made. We were all set until we got hit by China with the virus. Jonathan, there was actually, we were becoming a very unified country.\nBecause of success.\nWell, I hope not. I hope not. Certainly the…\nThe knee on the neck was a disgrace. Okay?\nIt was a disgrace.\nI hope the answer to that question is no. Does anybody really answer that question accurately? Does anybody really know?\nI have seen where there is a difference and I don't want there to be a difference. I don't like that there would be a difference. But with that being said-\n… in larger number, police have killed white people.\n… but I don't like it.\nI don't know why, but I don't like it. I do know this-\n… that police have killed many white people also.\nIt speaks to something, if that's the number?\nOkay. If that's the number, it speaks to something that to me is unacceptable.\nLet me just tell you.\nI've done a thing called criminal justice reform.\nAnd your friend President Obama couldn't get done.\nHe tried, but he couldn't get it done. I got criminal justice [crosstalk]-\nI got opportunities on, I took care of the historically Black… If you look at what I've done for colleges, for Black colleges and universities, I got them funding. Obama never did it. I did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, whether you like it or not. People say, \"Oh, that's interesting.\"\nI think I did, yeah.\nI've done things. Well-\nAsk. Ask. How has it worked out? If you take a look at what Lyndon Johnson did?\nHow has it worked out? Because frankly, it took a long time, but for African Americans-\n… under my administration, Jonathan, under my administration, African Americans were doing better than they have ever done in the history of this country. So I did a lot, job numbers, all of it, money. They had money, they were getting great. Their percentage was up, their housing ownership was up. They did better than they've ever done until we got hit-\n… and now you know what we're doing? I'm building it up again. We're going to have it. Next year will be a great year, unless it's screwed up by somebody that doesn't know what he's doing, which could happen, but I don't think it will.\nI don't know. I really don't know. I don't know. I don't know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration. He chose… I never met John Lewis, actually, I don't believe.\nI can't say one or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive. But no, but I didn't go-\nHe didn't come to my inauguration. He didn't come to my State of the Union speeches, and that's okay. That's his right. And again, nobody has done more-\n… for Black Americans than I have.\nHe should've come. I think he made a big mistake by not showing up.\nHe was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights, but there were many others also.\nI would have no objection to it if they've like to do it.\nWould have no objection to it whatsoever.\nWell, thank you very much. Great honor.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-jonathan-swan-axios"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-03", "Text": "Thank you very much. I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias. It's a very interesting name. Last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I've issued emergency declarations to support a response in both of those areas. So that's Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.\nThis week, the storm passed just east of Florida. Got a little bit lucky. Didn't hit Florida too hard. Working with the Governor, working with everybody. But it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might.\nIt's currently off the coast of South Carolina, heading northward to North Carolina. It's expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a category 1 hurricane. Very serious. A lot of water. A lot of water coming from that storm.\nI've already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina. And FEMA's personnel—and they are great; they're doing a job—they're already on the ground in all areas. Every single area that we mentioned is covered.\nOver the next several days, there's expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey. We're working with each of those States, and in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement—all of the different groups that are involved. Storm surge and inland flooding are possible, and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes.\nI encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the State and local authorities. We're working with them. And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far. So stay safe.\nNext, let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus. We're beginning to see evidence of significant progress. Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6 percent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 to 8 percent over that same period of time, an encouraging sign—very encouraging, I have to add—that the virus is receding.\nIn hotspots across the South and West, we've seen slow improvements. From their recent weekly peaks, Arizona's weekly case counts have dropped 37 percent. That's a tremendous drop. And the Governor and the State have done a fantastic job. Down 37 percent. Texas down 18.7 percent. I was there a couple of days ago. And Florida, 21.2-percent drop. So that's a tremendous job that they're all doing.\nAs we begin to contain the virus in these States, we must focus on new flareups in the States where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri. And I think you'll find that they're soon going to be very much under control.\nMeanwhile, 18 States continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates, under 5 percent: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It's under five.\nEven in these States, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful, in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those States. To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places, and to protect the elderly—very, very important—protect the elderly. It's much different. Young children have very strong immune systems. We've learned how strong they are. But protect the elderly. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. That's the average age.\nIt's important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward, and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent.\nAs we're seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging—you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough, invisible enemy—lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future. They just don't. It comes back. Many times, it comes back. The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially as it respects to—with respect to hospitals; learn more about the disease; and develop effective treatments, as we did in the United States. We're doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics.\nCountries where there have been very significant flareups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan. And also, as you probably heard, in Hong Kong, they've had some very serious flareups. Japan has gone—yes, a lot, six-fold—six-fold flare up. That's a lot. But they'll get it under control.\nIn our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school, with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools. We want to open them.\nAt the same time, we're placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment, and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine. The vaccines are coming along incredibly well.\nToday I'd like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we've done. We're taking—really taking an increased interest, and we're seeing numbers that nobody can even believe, in terms of percentage increase. It's telehealth for American patients. The percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it's very, very significant, numbers that you would not even think possible.\nThis has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA health care team. And it worked out really well. We have a 91-percent approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we're doing. This is the first—it's the highest ever recorded.\nNow telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA, and it's becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens. You don't have to go to the doctor's office; you don't have to go to hospitals.\nWhen the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience. And really, they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes.\nToday I'm taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay. Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an Executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent. We've done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we're doing on medicine and medical and what we're doing. They can do things that you wouldn't believe, that even a year ago, 2 years ago would not have been doable. We're enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient. And very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you.\nThe order builds upon a series of actions we've all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That's no additional cost. And copayments can be waived for telehealth services.\nWe are working very hard also on prescription drug prices. And I will tell you that the \"favored nations\" clause that I've signed into existence—nobody thought anybody would ever do that—has a massive impact on prescription drug prices, in addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, in particular prescription drugs.\nBut the \"favored nations\" clause is massive. For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 10 cents a pill, as an example—just as an example—and the United States pays $2 for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right as they do. We never had that before. We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development. So the numbers are astronomical. And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by Big Pharma. Very big ads. Very massive buy.\nBut, in the meantime, they're calling. They want to know if they can make a deal. And I say to people, \"The only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you.\" And they understand that. I think our people understand that.\nBut, in particular, when you look at the matching—you could call it \"matching\" or you could call it \"favored nations\"—call it whatever you like—it's a tremendous—it's going to have a tremendous—and I'm talking about 50, 60 percent, 70 percent. That doesn't mean it goes to 10 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up, and ours goes down. And you have many, many countries where their numbers—the numbers are so low. I mean, so low. And by that, I mean, much lower than the United States.\nAnother thing I'm doing is if a certain country, like Canada—Canada buys for very much less than the United States has bought. How they allowed this to happen—representatives of our country standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office—how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible.\nWe've been working on this for a long time. I've been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right? So now a Governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida—who is doing a great job—or our great Governor of Ohio or a great Governor of any State can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50-percent less. So we'll be buying from Canada.\nNow, what the drug companies are going to do—maybe they'll raise them, maybe they'll lower them, or maybe they'll just give up and sell them to us directly much cheaper. So a lot of things are happening.\nAlso, the rebate—we have people that are very wealthy that nobody ever heard of them. Nobody knows who they are. I guess, in some cases, they can be pharmacies; in some cases, they're individuals. We're doing a rebate, and the rebate goes to the people. It lowers the price of drugs.\nSo we have a series of four things that we signed. And you will see, over a period—a fairly short period—drug prices are going to be tumbling down at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible.\nWe have—in 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration. It was last year. Fifty-one years it went up. But that was just a small decline. This is a massive decline. This is a decline that nobody can believe. I was called by Senators, I was called by Congressmen, \"Please don't do this.\" But Big Pharma doesn't mean anything to me other than we want them to do a great job. We want them to get their vaccines. We want them to do what has to be done.\nSo I think you're going to see drug price reductions over the next 4 or 5 or 6 months—it will probably take a little while to kick in—that are going to be at numbers that you wouldn't believe. But in the meantime—they called on Friday afternoon—they want to meet and see if they do something else. They don't like \"favored nations\" clauses. I understand that.\nWe vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services—through telehealth, by the way—including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority. We brought the substance abuse—at least prior to the China plague or whatever you want to call it—we brought it down very substantially. Pediatric critical care and much more.\nThanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services. So a very, very big priority on telehealth. As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help health care providers and hospitals expand their telehealth. And they're all doing it. They're doing it gladly.\nPrior to the epidemic or the pandemic—whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it—but prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn't anything raging. And I guess one of the only good things that we've gotten out of this whole horrible situation is, telehealth has been incredible. And again, the increases are, you know, many hundreds of times greater than it was before. Do you have a number? It's like 2,000 percent or something like that. It's an incredible increase. You'll get the number. But it's—I think they have it now finally, and it's really an incredible—thank you, Kayleigh.\nWe worked with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus. We cut redtape to allow many services to be conducted by phone, rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. Thirty-five percent of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone. So you're talking about six-point—3.6 million seniors. That's something. Ten-point-one million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic. So you're talking there 10.1 million people.\nIn April, over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than 0.1 percent in February. Those are part of the numbers that I think—I'll have you get them. So this part, you don't have to; you'll get the other section. Thank you.\nSo think of that: compared to less than 0.1 percent—0.1 percent. That's an incredible number. So over 43 percent of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to—so you went from 0.1 percent to 43 percent. That's an incredible—that's an incredible number.\nThe Executive order I signed today will also expand health care access in rural America. We take care of rural America. It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure. And we're working very hard with all of the people in Government that are involved with the communications infrastructure so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access.\nAdditionally, revenue for rural providers vary significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business. Many, many are having a very difficult time. To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility—really, great flexibility—and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients.\nFurthermore, I'm directing the Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission—we were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium—to form a Task Force that will break down barriers to expanding rural health care. This order continues my administration's focus on rural health care.\nWe allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas. We allocated another $10 billion to 2,000 rural hospitals and more than 2,400 rural health clinics. We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time—and these are people that had great reputations and great track records—for practitioners that serve on the frontlines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients.\nWe're also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the State and local areas have the supplies they need. We've been supplying hospitals and cities and States, Governors—helping Governors—at a number that nobody has ever heard of before. Fifteen-thousand-four-hundred-and-forty nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment. They're very much stocked up; they're in great shape. They all have the ventilators—all the ventilators they need. They have, actually, more than they need. And their equipment—medical equipment is in very, very good shape. They're full.\nMy administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves, and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide. We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we've been talking about together on vaccines and treatments.\nUnder Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting—most exciting—last week, we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Had great results. This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia. And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along.\nHospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late-stage illness. They've been very good. We're also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies, and that, we're working on. And that's a brilliant art. It's really an art. And we launched a national plasma drive last week—I was at the Red Cross building—with the American Red Cross and 13 other health care organizations.\nI urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov—coronavirus.gov—and donate plasma today. We would really appreciate it. This really makes people better. But we need—what we need is, we need that beautiful ingredient that you, that got better, seem to have in your veins. You have to go to coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today. It will be tremendous. We really appreciate it if you do it, because we're low. We're low. We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing. It will take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative. Makes people better. And you know, you had something very special. You had something that knocked it out. So we want to be able to use it. So whatever you can do—coronavirus.gov.\nAs a result of improvements we've made in treatment, for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85 percent from its April peak. Eighty-five percent decline.\nOn vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK]On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK]On vaccines, last week, we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX [GSK]* to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine. One hundred million doses. This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting. We are supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, who are having wonderful results, and they're in final stages of testing.\nThere are now two vaccines in the—in that final stage of clinical trials in America, with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately. And we have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies. These are great companies. These are companies that are not only well known, they're well respected, most importantly.\nWe're balancing speed and safety, and we're on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year. And we're mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we're ready immediately upon approval. We have our military lined up. It's logistics; it's all about logistics. They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers. But now they'll be doing vaccine. Our general is all ready to go, and he's very excited. And once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he'll start the process. They will start the process, and they'll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond, if it works as we think it probably will.\nBy unleashing America's technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic, and we will, hopefully, end it very quickly. The therapeutics are very exciting to me—where you can go into a hospital, and whether it's through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody, and they get better. That's something, to me, that's very important. And we're doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines.\nSo thank you all very much for being here. We'll take a couple of questions.\nYes, please.\nDeath of Servicemembers in a U.S. Marine Corps Training Accident Off the California Coast\nThey're actually briefing me in a little while. We have it scheduled for a little while from now.\nOh, it's terrible. No, it's terrible, and we'll be in contact with the families. A thing like that is terrible.\nOh, absolutely not. Absolutely not.\nIt's possible that I get involved. But no, it won't have anything to do with—we want to make people better. We want to send them to the areas that most need it. And I think we're going to have something very soon. It's going good\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], please.\nWell, I think we're doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look—if you take a look at what's going on, especially now with all these flareups in nations that they were talking about—and don't forget: We're much bigger, other than India and China. China is having a massive flareup right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems.\nAnd I notice that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any of the news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like, we thought we might be over it in Florida, and then, all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back.\nBut I think we're doing very well. I told Dr. Birx I think we're doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She's a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi has treated her very badly—very, very badly. Very nasty. And I'm just referring to the fact that I thought that, really, they should say the job we've done, whether it's on ventilators or testing—we've tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people with great—in many cases, about 50 percent now rapid fire, meaning 5- to 15- to 20-minute test, where you get the result almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. And I think we're just doing very well.\nYes, go ahead.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes.\nEither way. Whether it's Microsoft or somebody else, or if it was the Chinese, what the price is, the United States could—should get a very large percentage of that price because we're making it possible. Without us—you know, I use the expression, \"It's like the landlord and the tenant.\" And without the lease, the tenant doesn't have the value. Well, we're sort of, in a certain way, the lease. We make it possible to have this great success. TikTok is a tremendous success, but a big portion of it is in this country.\nIt would come from the sale, yes. Whatever the number is would—it would come from the sale———\n——which nobody else would be thinking about but me. But that's the way I think. And I think it's a—I think it's very fair.\nBut we want no security problems with China. It's got to be an American company. It's got to be American security. It's got to be owned here. We don't want to have any problems with security, et cetera. And something could come out. I will tell you, there's a lot of excitement not only by Microsoft, but by other companies, in terms of buying it.\nSo we'll see what happens. But we want and we think we deserve to have a big percentage of that price coming to America, coming to the Treasury.\nI might do that, yes.Q.So I was wondering if you could talk about both how you might prevent evictions through executive action and then also if there——\nYes, I could do that if I want, and I want to do that. I don't want people to be evicted. And you know, when they're evicted, when they're thrown out of their, whatever the place may be, in many cases, they go to big shelters. And if you talk about pandemic, this is a pandemic, and they go to shelters. Number one, they're thrown out viciously. It's not their fault, it's China's fault. It's not anybody's fault, it's China's fault.\nBut number two, and if they are thrown out, they oftentimes will go to a shelter with tremendous numbers of other people. And the virus will spread, and we don't want that.\nWell, I can do that also through an Executive order. So we'll be talking about that.\nBut we're having a very good discussion with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. The problem is they want to do bailouts of their various Democrat-run States and cities, and they want a lot of money. They want a trillion dollars for that. And so they want to do much more than COVID related. They want to do—they want to bail out cities and States that have been in trouble for years of bad management—in all cases, Democrat-run cities—and we don't think that's fair. You understand that. You've heard it before.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nDeployment of Federal Law Enforcement Personnel to U.S. Cities/National Guard\nYes. It's not a mass send, but it's sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the guns and the things that are happening. It's not like sending in the National Guard and stopping it cold, which, as an example, a lot of progress has been made in Portland. But you know, frankly, sending in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis, it stopped it cold. From the time we sent that National Guard, they walked down the street, it was over in Minneapolis. Now it may be starting up again.\nThis is—these are Democrat-run cities and States, and it hasn't been a pretty picture to watch. We will help Chicago. We'll help New York, if they request. They have to request the help, but we want to stop the drugs. We want to stop the guns. A lot of the Chicago is guns and—but what it is, is drug related, gang related. Largely gang related.\nWith ICE, we send out thousands of MS-13—thousands and thousands of MS-13. We send them back or, in some cases, have to put them in prison. They're too violent. They're truly violent.\nSo we're helping out. When you look at what's happening in Chicago and some other cities with the shootings and the killings, they need help. And we haven't met with resistance, I have to be honest with you. I think it's good that we haven't. But we're only looking to help them. We're only looking to help.\nYes.\nWell, there's never been a push like this for mail-in ballots. And if you look at the New York Congressional race, which is a disaster—Carolyn—it's been a total disaster. They have—they're 6 weeks into it now. They have no clue what's going on. And, I mean, I think I can say right here and now, I think you have to rerun that race, because it's a mess.\nNobody knows what's happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots, I guess. I think you'd probably have to take the Carolyn Maloney race and run it over again. How can you do this? And this is a small race with literally thousands of people—small thousands—and it's all messed up.\nYou look at Paterson, New Jersey, it's all messed up. Almost every one of these—and these are small, easy to control. They should be able to do this easy.\nNow you're talking about, like, Nevada, where last—2 nights ago, they went out and in the darkness of night without people, without having any meetings of the public, without having anything, they approved a ridiculous—you don't have to look at signatures. You don't have to approve anything. You can have double mailings. You can have all sorts of things. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It's a disgrace. I mean, honestly, it's a disgrace.\nSo it's a very good question. I mean, the mail-in ballots, if you look at just some of the small places, the small races—congressional race in New York, it should be very easy. Normally, that would have been announced at 7 o'clock, and it would have been down to the wire and everybody would have loved it. If it was at all complex, it would have taken an extra 45 minutes or an hour, and they would have announced it a little bit later. They have no clue. This was about 6 weeks ago, and they have no clue what's going on.\nThey've lost ballots. There's fraudulent ballots. It's—how are you going to do that for an entire nation? They're using COVID to try and get the mail-in ballots.\nNow, absentee ballots are great. Absentee ballots, they have to request them. They go through a process. They get them. But the universal mail-in ballots have turned out to be a disaster.\nAnd what Nevada has been doing—if you look, over the last few days, you have to look at what they've done. You can have two ballots, you can harvest—it's harvesting, so you can take thousands of ballots, put them together and just dump them down on somebody's desk after a certain period of time.\nThey have something where, if you vote, the vote can count up to 7 days later. Well, if the vote is going to count 7 days later, that means you—you know, if it depends on the one State like Nevada, that would mean simply that you can't have—supposing it's down to that one State—it could be—it's a great State. But supposing it's down to that one State, that means you have to wait 7 days.\nBut they won't have it there. This is something that's so messed up. And by the way, I have to say, the Post Office, for many, many years, has been, you know, run in a fashion that hasn't been great. Great workers and everything, but they have old equipment—very old equipment. And I don't think the Post Office is prepared for a thing like this. You'll have to ask the people at the Post Office. But how can the Post Office be expected to handle? They have regular mailing, and then now, on top of that, they have the internet, where you have Amazon and these companies doing, you know, all the buying—instead of going to a department store, they go buy through mail. So you have massive numbers of purchases now going through the Post Office, purchases of items and gifts, and that's a tremendous strain on the Post Office. The Post Office loses a fortune, and it has been for many, many years, for decades.\nSo now, on top of it, it has this, and the Amazons of the world and the others, they pay very, very little money. They lose money on every—the Post Office loses money, which is ridiculous, on every package it delivers. But now, on top of that—and I'm not just referring to Amazon, I'm talking about all of the competitors, if there is such a thing, to Amazon. There will be. But if there is such a thing.\nBut now, on top of that, you'll have somebody like the Governor of Nevada come out with this massive plan, out of nowhere, to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You'll never know who won that State. It will get messed up just like New York and just like Paterson, New Jersey and just like many other places.\nIn West Virginia, they indicted a postman for doing something very bad. You know that. And—but there are many cases all over the country. If you look, you'll be able to find—there's a list of them all over the country. And that has to do with universal mail-in.\nAgain, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they'll do absentee. It really works. But universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country.\nWell, I have the right to do it. We haven't gotten there yet, but we'll see what happens. We will be suing in Nevada, and that's already been taken care of. We'll probably file something tomorrow.\nI do want to say that we're going to be introducing a tremendous health care plan sometime prior—hopefully, prior to the end of the month. It's just completed now.\nIn addition, next month, we'll be doing the immigration plan. So we'll be doing that in September. We'll be doing, sometime during this month, the health care plan. And I think that will be before the end of the month. And I think it will be very impressive to a lot of people.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1248"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-04", "Text": "Hello, everybody. Thank you very much. Let me begin by sending America's deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed, hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut. Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon, and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack.\nI also want to provide the latest on Tropical Storm Isaias. Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East Coast, and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible. I spoke to Governor Cooper, I spoke to Governor DeSantis, and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA, and they're working very hard.\nCoastal areas in the storm's path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents, while inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds. FEMA is responding to States that have requested the assistance. We have a list of those States; we can give them to you in a little while. And my administration is monitoring the situation very closely.\nWe have the military on guard, but we have—FEMA is there, in all cases. The Corps of Engineer is ready if needed—the Army Corps of Engineers. Very talented people. I urge everyone in the storm's path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your State and local authorities.\nI now want to update you on the path forward, having to do with the China virus. Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers, which are rather spectacular, that just came out. The manufacturing index of the Institute for Supply Management—that's \"ISM\"; most of you know it by \"ISM\"—increased for the third month in a row, rising nearly 2 points in July to 54.2—that's fantastic—the highest reading since March of 2019.\nThis is remarkable, considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest, in particular, virus hotspots. The ISM measures—and it's a very strong measure of new orders. It rose 5 points in July, to 61.5, in its highest rating, that would be, since September of 2018. That's a big number.\nSince the April low, new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM, dating back all the way to 1948. So 34 points—that's the largest since 1948. Similarly, the ISM's measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest 3-month gain in over 70 years. That's some number. These were somewhat surprising, but I've been saying we're doing well, and those numbers are really spectacular.\nAutomobile sales, likewise, are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up, stunningly. Its 65-percent increase since then, to 14.5 million units, which is a massive number.\nThe great strength and great news is really for States like—in particular, Michigan; and Ohio; South Carolina; Pennsylvania, very good; Florida, a little bit. These are great numbers, record-setting numbers.\nThe strength in new car sales is also evident in the used car market, where soaring demand—literally, soaring demand—is putting upward pressure on the used car prices. This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry. The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector—and, we think, very substantially, based on the numbers. We're very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers, in a very positive way.\nEconomy-wide, inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter. A crash, in that case, means a good thing, not a bad thing. That's the largest drop ever on record—ever.\nHomebuilder sentiment, likewise, is soaring, as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year. And new homes recently made a 13-year high. So we have a 13-year high in new home construction.\nNew business applications are very strong. That just came out. The widely followed Atlanta Fed GDP—and it's something that they have just come out with—now forecasts the new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates. It looks like it's showing a 20-percent annualized growth in the current quarter. So 20 percent in the current quarter; we'll take that all day long. I—let's see if that's right. That's a projection. So we'll see if that's right. The Atlanta Fed, very respected.\nThe virus—back to that—we are continuing to monitor and monitor, in particular, hotspots across the South, Southwest, and the West. And we're seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well, actually, especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for—ever since we've gotten to understand this horrible, horrible plague that's been unleashed on our country by China.\nAs of yesterday, cases are declining in 70 percent of the jurisdictions, compared to 36 percent last Monday. That's a big, big number. Eleven out of 13 States with the positive rate above 10 percent have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July. In other States, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always is strong, even though the numbers are getting very good—States that have a test positivity rate between 5 and 10 percent. And in the States with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them.\nWe must ensure that these States do not become new flareups, so we're watching them very, very closely. Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself, the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths.\nFatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak. So the death—the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level. One is too much—one death—because this should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped at—very easily, by China, in Wuhan.\nThanks to our major advances in treatment, we've seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups. Compared to April, mortality rates are 85-percent lower among individuals aged 18 to 69, and 70-percent lower among individuals over 70 years old.\nWe've also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly. Approximately 85 percent of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65—just getting some very accurate numbers on this. And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications.\nSince the pandemic began, nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted living centers. That's an incredible statistic, when you hear that number. This data underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk.\nAs we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly, and we're doing that. We're doing that at a level that we've never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlining [underlying]* conditions, especially the elderly with the underlining—whether it's heart or diabetes—they seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems. While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school.\nWhere embers flare up, we must engage immediately, and that's what we're doing. This is the science-based approach, and that's good with us. Working very hard on that. An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations, while inflicting massive economic pain, long-lasting damage on society and public health as a whole.\nSo there won't be lockdowns, but we watch specific areas. We're very careful, and we're putting out embers. We're putting out flames. When you look at what's happening with Miami, and it's going—the numbers are going down. But Florida is going down very significantly. Texas and California are going down rather significantly.\nOn telemedicine, as we discussed the last time, as—and as I said numerous times during this day, it's an incredible thing that's happening. A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth, so seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes. And that's what's happening. The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million—so from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week. In total, 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began. That's a tremendous thing that's happened with telehealth.\nAs we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines. Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials, with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks. And you've read and seen what's happened today. Today's news was very exciting.\nThrough Operation Warp Speed, we're also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we're determined to have a vaccine very quickly. We think we're going to have something very soon.\nWe have great companies. These are the—among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don't like me so much because I'm forcing them to drop drug prices—prescription drug prices—very massively. Some of these companies are involved in that; some of them aren't. We're having a tremendous—you'll see a tremendous drop in price. We're using favored nations; we're using the rebates. We're using everything.\nFor so long, I've heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them \"the middlemen.\" And they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they're very wealthy people.\nAnd we're doing the rebates. We're doing purchases from other countries, like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to, under a very bad system. I don't call it \"archaic\"; I call it \"bad\" because it's meant, really, for drug companies to get higher prices.\nBut under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 10 cents and ours is $2, we're allowed to say we want favored nations, and we want the pill for the same—the same as the lowest country in the world. If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that's the price we're going to get. Drug companies aren't too happy about that, Big Pharma. We've also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness. Today the NIH—we're—very exciting—announced that they're beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country. We're going to move very quickly. Results look very good already. Incredible results.\nMore than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway, and we've secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir—of remdesivir. We're really doing a job with it, and it's helping a lot of people. That's why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good, relatively speaking, that is. But that's for American hospitals through the month of September. So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September. That's big news.\nThe United States also has far and away the most robust testing capacity in the world. Testing has been incredible, what we've been able to do. Nobody is even close. Since March 12, we've increased daily testing by 32,000 percent. How's that? Thirty-two thousand percent. Somebody would say, \"That must be a typo.\" It's not a typo. Thirty-two thousand percent.\nWe now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide, averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly 5 million tests per week. And now that we're understanding the virus, we're understanding very much what we're doing with respect to who it affects, who it's destroying, and who gets away with it, like young people, very young people. We'll be having some interesting statements having to do a testing and focus testing. I call it \"focus testing.\"\nBy comparison, Mexico—so we're doing numbers that are incredible. But by comparison, Mexico—as you know, the President was here; he's a great guy—but their numbers are much different. They do about 1 million tests. France has done 2.9 million tests. Canada is around the 4 million mark. Australia is around the 4 million mark. The United States is testing more people in a single week than, in many cases, large segments or large, well-known countries all put together. It's been an amazing achievement: the testing and the quality of the testing also. And now we're doing testing where you can have results in 5 minutes, in 7 minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting to come back from labs—for it to come back from labs.\nOver the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge; New Orleans; Phoenix; Miami; Jacksonville, Florida; McAllen, Texas; Bakersfield, California. And this week, we're opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas; Atlanta. To date, more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites.\nLast week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual's blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response.\nFEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than—we have new numbers—more than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls, and 21 billion gloves—billion. Can you believe that? Billion gloves.\nAnd we distribute that to the Governors, different States. And they're—when we get on the phone with them, they're very happy, that I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They're very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we've done.\nIn our National Stockpile, we've tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million; tripled the number of gowns to 15 million; and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000. These numbers are growing every day, and we're now making thousands of ventilators—many thousands of ventilators—a month. And we're getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators. They're very hard to produce. They're very complicated machines. So we're fully stocked here, and we've made sure that every State is fully stocked, but we're getting them to a lot of countries that need help.\nWe'll continue to work with the Governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine. I'm more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus.\nAnd I want to thank you all for being here. We'll take a few questions.\nYes, please.\nWell, I don't know. I wasn't involved in the deal. The concept of the deal is good, but I'll let you know. We'll do a little study on that, and we'll find out.\nIf there's—if there is any problem, we'll let you know about it very quickly, but I wasn't involved in it.\nIt's a big deal. It's a way of bringing back a great area too, in addition to the pharmaceuticals. Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business. And so we'll see what that's all about, but we'll let you know very quickly.\nYes, please.\nWell, it would seem like it, based on the explosion. I've met with some of our great generals, and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not a—some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was a—seems to be, according to them—they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind, yes.\nRight.\nWell, a lot of our numbers were based on the—New York had a very tough time, as you know. New York, New Jersey—that area. And when you take them out—just as an example, take a look at Florida, relative to New York.\nThat's not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together. It's crowded. It's not easy.\nBut when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in—I will get back to you, but we have among the lowest numbers. They've done a fantastic job on it.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nYes.\nWe are looking at it. We're also looking at various other things that I'm allowed to do under the system, and—such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we're allowed to do things.\nWe're talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat-run States and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean, really bad management. So that seems to be where they're looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats, in some cases, radical-left Democrats that have not done a good job.\nI appreciate—today the Wall Street Journal said very good things—that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in. Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, and the folks—we went into Portland, and we've done a great job. And they had that in an editorial, that we really won that situation. But we want the whole—we did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in. We took care of it. And we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said.\nAs far as the various things that I may or may not sign: I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made, as you know very well, on the Hill. We'll see what happens. But I have the right—including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things.\nWe want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It's not their fault. It's China's fault; it's not their fault. And people are being evicted, and we can do that with an Executive order. So if we don't get—and we want to do it relatively quickly.\nI mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted, and then they go into shelters, and there are thousands of people in the shelters. And this is not a time—you never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it, and it's no good.\nSo I may have to do something on evictions too, because the Democrats, amazingly, don't want to do it. We offered them short-term deals, and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out States that have been poorly managed by Democrats.\nDid you say, \"That's impressive\"? Did you actually use that term?\nOh, unprecedented—well, it's almost the same thing. Not quite. [Laughter] I like \"impressive.\" I like \"impressive\" much better. Not quite, but close.\nSo TikTok—TikTok is very successful. It does tremendous business in the United States. People are riveted by it. I mean, I have many friends—when they saw that announcement, they're calling. And I think their kids love it; they don't. Because they don't get to see their kids anymore, but they are—it's an amazing thing, whatever it may be.\nAnd I told Microsoft—and frankly, others—if they want to do it, if they make a deal for TikTok—whether it's the 30 percent in the United States or the whole company, I say: \"It's okay. But if you do that, we're really making it possible, because we're letting you operate here.\"\nSo the United States Treasury would have to benefit also, not just the sellers. And I said, \"Inform\"——\nVery simple. I mean we have—we have all the cards because, without us, you can't come into the United States. It's like if you're a landlord, and you have a tenant. The tenant's business needs a rent; it needs a lease. And so what I said to them is, \"Whatever the price is, a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the Treasury of the United States.\"\nAnd they understood that. And actually, they agreed with me. I mean, I think they agreed with me very much.\nYes, please. In the back.\nSo that deal may or may not happen. We've given them until September 15 or so, and we'll see.\nIf we can have it and there can be great security—meaning, the obvious security—Microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect. They're approved in that respect at many levels, including working with the Department of Defense. And you know, they're very high-level approvals. So it would be good, but there are other companies also.\nYes, please.\nNo, we've had other companies call us, and Microsoft called me directly. And we've had other companies call. I don't know where they are. It sounds like Microsoft is along the way of doing something. I don't blame them. It'd be—you know, it's great company. It's really a great company.\nBut we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies, including Huawei, which as you know, we put a halt to. But we can't take the security risk.\nI think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world, and it shouldn't have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don't know. When you lose——\n——when you lose so many thousands of people, and—you know, ultimately, it'll be millions of people around the world. It's a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWell, we do more testing than anybody in the world, as I explained—and I don't mean just a little bit. If you look at India, they're at about 11 million, and we're at 61 million. And there comes a point when you just—you want to focus your testing in a different way. And we'll be announcing some—what we've done is incredible with the testing. Not only the testing——\nAnd we will continue, but we want to really be able to test, very specifically, the people that are in most danger, most in need.\nAll right. Please, go ahead.\nYes.\nOkay, I'm glad you're asking.\nSo Florida has got a great Republican Governor, and it had a great Republican Governor. It's got Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott—two great Governors. And over a long period of time, they've been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other States.\nI mean, in Nevada, where you have a Governor—he said, \"Let's just send out millions of ballots,\" and the Post Office cannot be prepared; I haven't spoken to the Post Office about it, but I don't know how they could possibly be prepared. Florida has been working on this for years. And they have a very good system of mail-in—and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So, in the case of Florida, there aren't too many people that would qualify.\nThey're so well run. Florida is a very well-run State: low taxes, low everything. They've done a great job, really a great job. And the two Governors, between the both of them, they've really got a great system of absentee ballots and even the—even in the case of mail-in ballots, the postal services have built up their—you know, it takes a long time.\nWhen you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they—and I'll give you the story: I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look.\nIn New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don't know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there—it's a disaster. And that's only for a relatively small number of ballots. But I think they have to do the election in New York over.\nThe Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It's a disaster. It's a mess. And they have to do that—I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is.\nSo, in the case of Florida, they've done a great job, and they've had tremendous success with it. But they've been doing this over many years, and they've made it really terrific. So, for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don't have to go. In maybe a couple of other States, they've worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn't take weeks or months.\nIn the case of Nevada, they're going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can't do that. I can't imagine the Post Office could do it. All of sudden, they're supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots?\nBut Florida has done a great job, and we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it's going to matter.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1249"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-05", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. It's good to be with you. I'd like to begin by providing an update on my administration's actions to protect American workers as we battle the China virus. Since the virus escaped China, my administration has enacted $3 trillion in economic relief. It's been very, very successful, and you saw that by the numbers that were issued yesterday and the day before, as to used car sales and auto production. They've been incredible numbers actually. Shockingly incredible.\nWe've been negotiating in good faith with Democrat leaders in the House to extend relief payments. We're negotiating right now as we speak, and we'll see how that works out. But if Democrat leaders put partisan demands aside, we would reach an agreement very quickly. It happened—it would happen very quickly.\nIn the meantime, my administration is exploring executive actions to provide protections against eviction—eviction is a big problem, very unfair to a lot of people; it wasn't their fault that this virus came from a faraway land—as well as additional relief to those who are unemployed, as a result of the virus.\nVery importantly, I'm also looking at a term-limited suspension of the payroll tax, something that has great support from many, many sides, especially some of our top economists and some people that we have great respect for. So we're looking at a suspension of the payroll tax.\nThe Democrats are primarily interested in a $1 trillion bailout of the poorly run States. We have some States and cities—you know them all; we don't have to go through names—but they've been very poorly run over the years. And we can't go along with the bailout money. We're not going to go along with it, especially since it's not COVID related.\nEarlier today I met with a great Governor, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. He's really done a fantastic job, beyond even the COVID situation, which you've been reading about as it pertains to Arizona, a State that is a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.\nArizona's record in reducing the spread of the virus while maintaining hospital capacity and allowing society to continue functioning—and functioning very nicely, very successfully—is an example that shows how our path forward can work in other States.\nArizona has a record—and a record, really, to be proud of. It's reduced the number of daily new cases by over 75 percent, cut the positivity rate in half, and reduced ER visits by two thirds, all the while keeping the economy functioning and functioning really well.\nWhen cases surged in June, the Vice President and Dr. Birx visited Arizona to consult with Governor Ducey. They had long consultations with Governor Ducey and his staff, and the Vice President has been in constant contact ever since. My administration is also collaborating with the State and local officials across the South and Midwest to provide similar guidance.\nWe had a great relationship with the representatives in Arizona, and it's been such a successful endeavor. The Federal Government has supplied or delivered more than 400 million pieces of personal protective equipment to Arizona, along with nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir. We've provided over one—excuse me, we provided over $18 billion in economic support to Arizona, including more than $8.6 billion to support over 80,000 small businesses. So we really have been helping Arizona, and it's gotten tremendous results. Our goal is to protect the most vulnerable, increase recovery rates—you know that; it's something so important—and prevent hospital overcrowding, all the while avoiding the kind of stringent lockdowns that would inflict substantial suffering in the phase—and this phase of the battle. We have the tools, resources, and knowledge to implement a targeted approach as we race to deliver a vaccine.\nAnd we are really working very hard on the vaccine, and we're doing—I think they're doing a fantastic job. I've been meeting with officials of some of the greatest companies in the world and meeting with scientists, and they're getting very close. If not there, they're getting very close. They're testing.\nAny proper analysis of infection control measures must take into account the short-term and long-term public health harms, including death caused by a far-reaching shutdown. When you shut down, you have many, many things that happen—from suicides to depression to drinking, alcohol problems, to drug problems, to problems with marriages. Problems with marriages. That—you have people confined to their house, their apartment for long periods of time, it can cause a lot of problems with that also.\nInstead, Arizona has adopted the following measures: The Governor advised residents to aggressively social distance when possible and maintain strict hygiene. The State encouraged mask use in crowded public places, especially when social distancing is not possible. The Governor also exercised his discretion to restrict capacity at indoor locations to limit the possibility of super spreading. It's a big thing.\nMy administration surged treatments. We got them a lot of treatments and therapies to the State, including nearly 70,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat over 11,000 patients, and it's been very successful, I might add.\nMy administration also delivered PPE and point-of-care testing to over 100 Arizona nursing homes. In total, the Federal Government has provided massive amounts of masks and equipments and gowns, and you know some of those numbers. But Arizona was a very big beneficiary, and they very much received—very much really appreciated.\nMore than 1,000 National Guard and medical personnel have also been deployed in Arizona, and they've really helped. They've been terrific, and I want to thank them. They have been brave and brilliant, combination of both.\nWe also supported our Tribal communities. The Tribal communities were hit very, very hard. Governor Ducey and I personally delivered rapid testing systems to the Navajo Nation, which has been really, really in originally bad shape and now getting better and very, very quickly. The Navajo Nation now has one of the highest levels of testing per capita anywhere in the world. We really worked very hard on the Tribal areas. And in particular, in this case, the Navajo Nation, they've done incredibly well.\nOverall, Arizona has conducted over 1.1 million tests, more than the entire nations of Japan, Mexico, and Switzerland. Arizona's per capita testing is higher than Germany, South Korea, France, and Canada. And Tribal governments in Arizona have received nearly $1.3 billion for the Coronavirus Relief Fund.\nMeanwhile, outdoor dining, limited indoor dining, and most of the other businesses in Arizona have remained open and very vibrant. They're doing incredibly well. This is an approach, and it's an approach that's been incredibly successful. Arizona has been able to protect high-risk populations and quickly bring its outbreak under control without the need to impose overly punitive measures. Thanks to advances in treating the virus, the fatality rate across all age groups in Arizona is very low. Arizona's scientific and data-driven strategy also preserved hospital capacity, ensuring that those who need care were able to receive it and receive it immediately, very quickly.\nAt the peak, approximately 15 percent of beds remained available statewide—that was at their peak—with roughly 20 percent of all occupied beds going to patients hospitalized for the virus. They kept other things going. They kept other forms of operations going. They kept elective surgery going. Did a really amazing job.\nToday, only 6 percent of the current hospitalizations in the State are related to the China virus. Arizona has also demonstrated success in protecting the State's African American population. Only 5 percent of patients hospitalized were African American, and African Americans represent just 2 percent of all deaths from the virus.\nAs it has worked to contain its outbreak, Arizona has also been formulating a plan to get children safely back to school as soon as possible. We want our schools open all over the country. We want our schools open. Arizona has worked very hard on this, and they're doing very well. The Department of Education is providing Arizona schools with $625 million—they're working very hard—and that's in conjunction with CARES funding.\nMy administration is actively working with other States in the same way we worked with Arizona. In recent weeks, members of the Coronavirus Task Force have visited over 15 States to encourage them to follow our path forward, including Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Indiana, and Ohio. And I'll be going to Ohio tomorrow. I look forward to it very much. It's a great place and a great State with an excellent Governor, and we look forward to being there tomorrow.\nNext week, Dr. Birx will be visiting Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas—and also, I believe they're trying to get in West Virginia, a great place, a great State, and I'm sure that will happen, because we'd like it to happen. They'd like to see her. So we're going to try very hard to get the doctor to West Virginia in addition to those States—to deliver aggressive, tailored, and targeted guidance.\nThe strategy we're taking to these States will protect those at highest risk while allowing others at a lower risk to safely resume work and school. If we do this successfully, it can be really something incredible, because we're talking about a lot of States. We're talking about many, many States.\nIt's really great to see also that Florida, we're coming down—it's coming down and pretty substantially in many locations. And even Miami is starting to come down. Miami was hit very hard. California likewise, and Texas likewise, coming down and really starting to be a substantial amount of reduction.\nIt recognizes that prolonged lockdowns impose a wide range of serious public health threats, including higher levels of suicide, drug overdoses, and other significant health harms resulting from the depression that we talked about—social isolation, economic hardship. It's been very tough for those people that are put in a lockdown position for too long. It really has been a very tough and harmful situation for many people.\nThe fact is that these harms are not measured daily here or abroad. It makes them really a very serious threat because people don't know exactly what they are and how bad they are, but I think they're very bad.\nGoing forward, we must continue to remain vigilant in shielding the elderly and those with underlying conditions. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, which is an incredible number and statistic, if you think about it. I also urge Americans to help us stop the spread of the virus: practice good hygiene, socially distance, avoid large crowds, and wear a mask where distancing is not possible. It's a patriotic thing to do. If you are sick, isolate yourself, especially from high-risk family members and friends. So important: Isolate yourself from high-risk family members and friends if you're not feeling well.\nTogether, we will defeat the virus and emerge from this safer and stronger than ever. Thanks to the robust Federal action in partnership with State and local leaders, new cases of the virus are declining in 80 percent of the jurisdictions, which is an incredible number, and the overall test positivity rate has declined by 8 percent since last week. Zero States have seen outbreaks get worse since yesterday—so zero States.\nWe're also continuing to make progress in the development of a vaccine. This is something so important. Also, therapeutics are on the front burner. We're having tremendous, I think—we'll let you know very soon, I think long before the end of the year—we're having tremendous success on therapeutics and tremendous success on vaccines, and we're ready to deliver them literally as soon as they're okayed.\nThis morning my administration approved $1 billion for Johnson and Johnson, who's been working very hard—and they think they have something very special—to manufacture and distribute 100 million doses of a China virus vaccine as soon as one is available. And again, we think that's going to be soon, and we think we're going to have the vaccines before the end of the year, maybe long before the end of the year.\nFinally, today I'm pleased to announce that the Department of Justice has issued $35 million in grants to 73 organizations nationwide, providing assistance to human trafficking victims. A terrible thing. You think of human trafficking as being an ancient form of crime. It's not. Because of the internet, it's a very modern crime all over the world, not just here—all over the world—human trafficking. It's usually in women or women and children. But it's—again, because of the internet, it's a terrible situation. Never been like this.\nAnd also, survivors who face heightened dangers during the pandemic—it's actually increased during the pandemic. I guess, some reasons are obvious, and some reasons are less obvious. But human trafficking, we're working very, very strongly.\nThe wall is up to 277 miles right now, and it's going up by the end of the year. It will be largely finished, shortly after the end of the year. And it's had a tremendous impact, a very positive impact on human trafficking. Unbelievable impact, actually.\nMy administration will never rest in our fight against the human trafficking. To me, it's one of the most horrific of crimes, and we work very hard on that.\nWith that, we'll take some questions. Please.\nWell, if you read, even the Washington Post had a terrible story on mail-in and the New York Times. And many, many newspapers have had terrible stories. You see them all over the internet. They've had some just horrible stories on mail-in ballots.\nYou look at Arizona [Nevada]*, you don't even have to have—as you know, they have a provision where they don't have to check signatures. So you sign it, and you could have a totally different signature. It's okay. It won't be approved. They have the right to go 7 days after the election for approval, so you're not even going to know who won the State of Nevada.\nOkay, but that's not what they said when they approved it. They said they're not going to check signatures; they're not going to be able to. And their machinery, which is old, doesn't allow them to. So they're going to be—it's going to be physically impossible for them to do that, especially in a short period of time.\nIn addition, you have the November 3 election, and they're allowed to count votes until 7 days after the election. So what does that mean? If—if Nevada, which is a big State and a great State, a State I like very much—and I think we're going to do very well there—are we going to wait a week after November 3? If it comes down to Nevada, which it could very well. I don't think so. I don't think it's appropriate.\nSo, with all of the bundling that you're going to have, with the harvesting you're going to have, with people being sent ballots all over that have, maybe, nothing to do with the State anymore, it's a terrible thing.\nIn New York, they had the Carolyn Maloney situation. And I criticized it badly over the last 2 years and—2 days. I mean, I gave it some very, very strong criticism, and all of a sudden, like a miracle, they just approved the winner. Well, what happened? Did the person that was second concede the race even though it was very close and all mixed up?\nThey have a terrible situation in New York with the ballots. You know that. And as soon as I said, \"Well, I think you should have a new election\"—because the election, obviously, they're not going to know what to do—\"I think you should have a new election,\" they, all of a sudden, announced a winner. I assume it was her. But they announced the winner.\nWell, I don't agree with it. Did somebody speak to the person on the other side, the opponent? Did they do something for the opponent on the other side?\nTake a look at Paterson, New Jersey. Take a look at many things. It's all over newspapers what's going on with the mail-in ballots. They vote—they send out millions of ballots—millions of ballots. They're totally unprepared to do it, and then they come back in the millions. It's going to be a disaster.\nI'm doing our country a big favor by bringing it up. And you know, from a common-stance point, even—commonsense standpoint, if you look at it just out of common sense and pure, basic, beautiful intelligence, you know it can't work.\nNow, Florida has worked very hard for years and years on developing a system, and I'm sure they probably have problems also. But absentee ballots are different than mail-in ballots—what you call \"universal mail-in ballots.\" They're much different. You have to apply for it. You have to do different things, and it's a much better system, and it's a system that can be reasonably accurate. But there's no system like going to the poll and voting.\nSo I would like to find out why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, in the midst of all of this grief, why is it that they approved the New York race? Why you asked that question.Q.Well, the Maloney race, sir, there's no evidence of widespread voter fraud there.\nWhich one?\nOh, really? Well, then you're reading—then you're reading a different newspaper than me.\nGo ahead, please. Go ahead, please. Go.\nCoronavirus Cases in the U.S\nIt's going away.\nIt's going away. It's going away. No, it will go away like things go away. Absolutely. It's——\n——no question in my mind it will go away.\nPlease, go ahead.\nHopefully, sooner rather than later.\nWell, I'd like to see the schools open. I think many of the schools—most of the schools will be open. I can say that Republican areas want to see them open, and the Democrats probably want to keep them closed until after November 3 because they think it's good for them politically. I actually don't think it's good for them politically.\nParents want the schools open. We want them open. We want them open safely. We're going to practice very strong hygiene and all of the other things that I've enumerated many times. But we want to see the schools open.\nNo, not his model. I just think he's done a very good job. I mean, he's really done a great job. If you look at the numbers, you look at how it's dropped, and very rapidly—he's done a great job. He's a great Governor.\nWell, when I say that, I'm talking about from getting very sick. If you look at children, I mean, they're able to throw it off very easily, and it's an amazing thing, because some flus, they don't. They get very sick and they have problems with flus, and they have problems with other things.\nBut for whatever reason, the China virus, children handle it very well. And they may——\n——they may get it, but they get it, and it doesn't have much of an impact on them. And if you look at the numbers, the numbers of—in terms of mortality, fatality, the numbers for children under a certain age, meaning young, their immune systems are very, very strong. They're very powerful, and they—they seem to be able to handle it very well, and that's according to every statistic.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nWhose—whose ballot?\nWith Kanye West? Oh.\nThat Kanye West does? I don't know that. Who said that?\nI don't know about that.\nI like him. I mean, I like him. He's always been very nice to me.\nHe's talking about Kanye West.\nNo, not at all. No, not at all, other than I get along with him very well. I like him. I like his wife. His wife recommended certain people, as you know, for—including Alice Johnson, who's a fantastic woman. But his wife recommended certain people to get out of prison. They were in prison for a long time—a long, long time. It should have never happened, and I took what she said very strong—Kim. Kim Kardashian. And, you know, he's got a good heart, very good heart. And I like Kanye very much. No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot.\nWe'll have to see what happens. We'll see if he gets on the ballot, but——\n——I'm not involved.\nPlease.\nThey're doing what? Republican Senators are doing——\nWell, if they need it. Certainly, that's a business—some businesses are doing better than they would normally. Obviously, we know what those businesses are, and obviously, the airline business is not doing very well. You have shutdowns all over the world, and you have airlines that are essentially shut down. Some airlines are doing, you know, modest—best they're doing is modest. I think it's very important that we keep the airlines going. There will be very good times, very soon, I hope. And we don't want to lose our airlines.\nSo if they're looking at that—whether they're Republican or Democrat—I'd be certainly in favor. We can't lose our transportation system.\nYes, go ahead.\nWell, they don't really know what it was. I can't tell you, whatever happened, it's terrible, but they don't really know what it is. Nobody knows yet.\nAt this moment, they're looking. It could—I mean, how can you say \"accident\"? Somebody was—you know, left some terrible explosive-type devices and things around, perhaps. Perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was an attack.\nI don't think anybody can say right now. We're looking into it very strongly. Right now it's—I mean, you have some people think it was an attack, and you have some people that think it wasn't.\nIn any event, it was a terrible event. And a lot of people were killed, and a tremendous number of people were badly wounded, injured. And we're standing with that country. You know, we have a very good relationship with that country, but it's a country under—there's a lot of turmoil, a lot of problems, but we stand with them.\nYes.\nJohn Thune did, right?\nThe Republican, John Thune? Oh, okay. Well, it is legal. There is no Hatch Act, because it doesn't pertain to the President.\nBut if I use the White House, we save tremendous amounts of money for the Government, in terms of security, traveling. If we go to another state or some other location, the amount of money is, you know, very enormous, so that's something to consider also.\nI think it would be a very convenient location. It would be, by far, the least expensive location. There'd be very little in terms of that tremendous traveling security with airplanes and everybody flying all over the place.\nSo I think it would be a very convenient idea. It's something that we threw out. It would be very cost-conscious by comparison to any other location.\nYes, please.\nRejected in what way?\nWell, I'd listen to both sides. I don't know of the argument yet, but I would certainly listen to both sides. My son has some very strong opinions, and he is very much of an environmentalist. And he was very impressed with what we did yesterday, because that's one of the great environmental bills, and beyond that, ever signed since—well, I guess over 100 years, if you think about it. It's been a long time.\nBut I will look at both sides of it. I had heard about it. I will be—I understand they're going to be doing a briefing sometime over the next 48 hours. It's going to go very quickly. I've done a lot for Alaska. I love Alaska. It's a special place. ANWR was one thing. The highway—Cove highway, or whatever the new name is, whatever the old name is. We're getting approvals for a tremendous highway that's been sought for 40 years. They've been trying to get it approved, and I'm getting it approved. We've done a lot for Alaska; it's a special place. And I'll take a look at that. That's interesting.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nSure.\nNot $300 billion, no. Not 300——\nNot 300. You mean $300 million?\nI will. I just heard of it for the first time. The ambulance people have done an incredible job, as have the doctors, the nurses, the frontline workers. Law enforcement has been incredible, the military, FEMA. I mean, I could name almost every group. I can't tell you of a group that's done poorly. But the ambulance people have done a very—it's a tough job too. Very dangerous job. Very tough job.\nI will certainly look into it. I mean, you're telling me something that—for the first time. Nobody is complaining about not getting paid too much, but we'll take a look at the ambulance drivers.\nYes, I know. Whatever he—if he—if that's what he heard, I think that—I've heard it both ways too. I've heard \"accident\"; I've heard, you know, \"explosives.\" And obviously, it must have been some form of explosives. But whether it was a bomb intentionally set off—it ended up being a bomb. But no, I've heard it both ways. It could have been an accident, and it could have also been something that was very offensive. And I wouldn't be very happy with that.\nWe're working very closely with the Government, and we're working very closely with many different agencies, including the military. And we'll be able to figure it out. We already, probably, have figured it out.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1250"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey", "Date": "2020-08-07", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. And it's a great honor to have everybody here. And I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend. We have a terrific number of things, and some very positive things to tell you tonight.\nI want to begin by giving an update on the economy. Economic health is vital to public health. That's why our strategy to kill the China virus has focused on protecting those at greatest risk while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school. Very important.\nWe added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May. And I will say that the job growth that we've seen over the last 3 months—9.3 million—is the single greatest 3-month period of job creation in American history. That's big stuff. That's big news and great news.\nOver the past 3 months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs. Over the last 3 months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember: \"You'd need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs\"? And we're getting them even in a pandemic—which is disappearing; it's going to disappear.\nAnd 639,000 brandnew construction jobs. Over half of the new jobs are full-time jobs, and wages are up by 4.8 percent, which is terrific. Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30 percent since April. Think of that: 30 percent since April.\nHispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32 percent. Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns—incredibly hard—increased by nearly 1 million over the past 3 months, and that's also a record. That's a job record: African American, 1 million. It's job record.\nWe must ensure that the progress continues. My administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world. So we've contributed $3 trillion.\nMy administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits; provide protections against evictions; a terrible thing happens with evictions. Not fair. It wasn't their fault that we were infected with this disease from China. And get relief to American families.\nYet, tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical leftwing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus. Nothing to do with it at all. So you have a virus that comes in, and you have people in Congress that don't want to help our people.\nIf Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act, under my authority as President, to get Americans the relief they need. And what we're talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months till the end of the year. And I can extend it at a certain period. Hopefully, I will be here to do the job. We're going to do the job; we've been doing a job like nobody could. Nobody would, actually. And so we're going to have the payroll tax go till the end of the year, and it will be retroactive to July 1. So we're going to go back to July 1, and it will go to the end of the year—payroll tax. At the end of the year, it may be extended. We're going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year. So unemployment benefits will be—that's a big one—will be brought out to the end of the year. And defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice—so students who are paying student loans and, in many cases, they're not even allowed to go back into their colleges. Extend the eviction moratorium—we will be extending that so people aren't evicted. Not their fault.\nWe had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France, concerning numerus subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon. Horrible, horrible event.\nAt 3 p.m. this afternoon I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft on the—are on the way, and they're fully loaded—fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things, lots of emergency equipment. Also first responders, technicians, doctors, and nurses are on their way. This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time. A horrible event.\nWe'll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world. Everyone wants to help. We spoke to a lot of people; they all want to help.\nThe United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come. We're working very closely with their Government and with their leaders.\nAnd on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families—a much larger number of families than anybody would have thought and than anybody at first thought—but all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy. We stand firmly with the people of Lebanon and will continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time. We have not seen anything like this in a long time.\nAs you know, earlier this week I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority who have been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority. As you know, this is a form of utility. It's been around for a long time, since FDR.\nAnd the head person—not controlled by Government, but it's sort of semipublic, in a sense—gets paid the highest salary in the world of Government. He gets $8 million a year. That's not a bad amount of money. It's $8 million a year. And we are not accepting that. Even though we're not the ones that appoint him or her—but, in this case, him—we're not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year. This has been going on for many years. And we will do something about that, and we're already in negotiations right now, including possible termination.\nThey and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers—the workers at the TVA—were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this and on top of the $8 million salary and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year. But, on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions—these incredible people—in order to train the lower-cost foreign workers imported to replace them. How's that for a law? And this was set up, originally, to create jobs and economic development, and now they're getting fired, and they're supposed to train people for a much lower—who get a much lower salary. It's crazy.\nThis was a grave injustice. I fired the Chairman of the Board in response. On Friday, I fired the Chairman of the Board, along with one other Board member. That's the one thing we have; we have the right to fire Board members. And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the Board members. And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course, totally. And today I'm proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee and Kentucky and other areas that are covered—great States, great States—that the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back. They're being rehired as we speak.\nIn this administration, we live by two rules: Buy American, and hire American. You can't do that; you can't fire all our workers and hire people back from other faraway parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people. And they can never train them as good as what you have, because they've been there for many years. They've done a fantastic job, and they love the TVA.\nWe had a lot of people in the office the other day; a lot of the media was covering it. They love the Tennessee Valley Authority. So—and they're so proud to work for it. But this happened, and it was a terrible thing, so now they're going to get their jobs back—they're all going to be getting their jobs back.\nNearly every nation on Earth continues to combat the virus. A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe. Cases continue to surge in Latin America. That's, right now, the most infected place anywhere in the world. They have more than doubled in recent days. Latin America is doing very little testing. They're not really equipped to do that. It's tough.\nIn the United States, more than 80 percent of jurisdictions report decline in cases. We're doing very well. You don't hear that too often from the media, but we're doing very well. We have a very large country, very complex country, in a sense. More than half of America's counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. So, if you look at that, more than half of America's counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. But we have to remain vigilant. We're doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.\nNationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July. The southern States that were very strong hotspots not long ago—Arizona, Texas, Florida—continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hospital beds.\nArizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus in-patients. Since mid-June, it's gone—the Governor was up, and we had a great meeting—Governor Ducey. And the meeting was terrific. But since mid-June—so they're doing well, and it's going down—heading down very rapidly, actually.\nTexas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley, and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths.\nFlorida is also stabilizing, and statewide positive test rate continues to decrease: from 13 percent on July 23, to 8 percent this week. Florida has done very well. It's going down; it's heading down, actually, quite rapidly. And even Miami, which was the hottest spot in Florida, is heading downward. But Florida has done very well.\nTexas has done very well, and rapidly. And Arizona has done incredibly well. So it—Arizona has really been a very rapid drop.\nNew Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1 percent of emergency room visits due to the China virus, the illness. It took a devastating toll on both States, as you know. While both States really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year, thankfully, we have not seen a resurgence. They've been doing a good job. Everybody is working very hard. Both Governors are working very, very hard. We're in touch with them. We're supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed, if needed. But they're needing very little right now. They're in very good shape. We will continue to monitor the new cases.\nThroughout this crisis, my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York, and to the people of every State—all of our States.\nWe're carefully monitoring California's Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. We're carefully watching regions from increasing cases, including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest. We're watching them all very carefully. It's vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable.\nFor this reason, we've delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America. We're focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems. Diabetes is a big problem. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. That's an incredible number, when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.\nAnd I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes, and they are very, very vigilant. They're doing a very good job now. They've really done something that I think is special. They're doing very well, in terms of the virus. They're working very hard. And a lot of things happen—a lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard. But the representatives of nursing homes—in some cases, the ownership of nursing homes—they're working very hard.\nThe Federal Government and the private sector have delivered more than 9 million N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns, and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone. Think of that. We've provided $3.4 billion to the State of New Jersey in emergency relief funding. So we happen to be in New Jersey right now, so those are great numbers. The Governor is working very hard; Governor Murphy is doing a good job. We're working very closely with him. We've also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and health care facilities.\nAnd through the Paycheck Protection Program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses. A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well, they're there because of what we did with Paycheck Protection.\nOn therapeutics and vaccine updates: Three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials. This would be years ahead of schedule. We have done wonders with the FDA. I want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn. But we have phase three trials already going on, which is, most people would have said, impossible to even think about.\nToday Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead's drug, remdesivir, where we've had tremendous success. Last week alone, my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what's going on. And if you can go to a blood bank—if you've had this disease and beat it, and there are a lot of people that have—if you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help.\nThe United States is only 5 percent of the world's population, but we have conducted over 25 percent of the world's testing. Think of that: 5 percent, and we've given 25 percent of the world's testing. Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account, because we're constantly showing cases, cases, cases; cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up, because we're doing—one of the reasons—we're doing a lot of testing.\nWe're doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests, where other countries have done very little testing. They'll test people if they get sick. They'll test people if they go into the hospital. They'll test certain people. We're doing tremendous testing. And we're especially doing big testing at the nursing homes.\nOver the last week, the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pooling samples. And we've also been able to send out many more of the tests, which are the 5-minute to 15-minute-result tests. Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we're very focused on and doing. But, in the not-too-distant future, we'll have so many tests where it's a quick test—they call it a \"quick test\"—5 minutes to 15 minutes. So we won't even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving. Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and, let's say, a day at the laboratory—that's 3 days right there. And the other tests, you can have them in 5 to 15 minutes.\nOver the next 2 weeks, I'll be pursuing a major Executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers. That's a big thing. I've always been very strongly in favor—we have to cover preexisting conditions. So we will be pursuing a major Executive order, requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all of its customers.\nThis has never been done before, but it's time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of.\nThis follows a series of Executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices—and significantly. We had the only year, which was last year, where drug prices went down in 51 years. But we're talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now, even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that's usually a reason—they're not happy. They can't be too thrilled. But they've made a lot of money over the years, and prices just go up. Not fair.\nThis includes a landmark Executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans—and charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. That means our country can't be charged more.\nSo if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price, and we're paying many times that price in the United States—because we pay for all of the research, the development, the promotion, and other things—we will get what's called a \"favored nations clause.\" We're going to have—and I signed a favored nations clause so that the United States—which is the number-one purchaser of drugs by far in the world—biggest purchaser in the world, not even close. You have other countries that are bigger, if you look at India, China, et cetera. Not too many. But we have countries that are bigger, but not even close, in terms of ordering drugs. We're the number-one country in the world.\nBut we have a favored nation—so if somebody has a drug—in many cases, it comes from a plant—the same plant. It comes from—it's the same pill; it's the same medicine or medication. Whatever the lowest country charges—so if Germany charges 10 cents for a pill and we charge $2—and I only use Germany as an example—then we get that for 10 cents. So what's going to happen is, that's going to go up a little bit, and ours is going to come down a whole lot. So it's the favored nations. And I will tell you that Big Pharma is not happy. For too long, we've been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries. We've subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe. Nobody talked about it. Everybody wondered: \"How come every President that runs for office says they're going to lower drug prices, and they never do? They go through the right—roof.\" Over the last administration they went up, like, skyrocketing—skyrocketing. That's Biden. Biden is not going to be able to be able to do it. He has no clue. [Laughter]\nSo what's happening is: We are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands. And we're going to give, essentially, all of the benefit that, frankly, they have as great negotiators—those benefits are going to go to our people. So it's called a \"favored nations clause,\" and you can look it up, and you can see. And nobody has had the courage to institute it, to call it because it's a very big step. But it's something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70 percent. We're talking about numbers that are unbelievable.\nI also signed an Executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves. These are some of the richest people in the world. Everyone talked about middlemen. I've heard about them for years, on prescription drug prices—middlemen. I guess you'd have to say to be politically correct, \"middle men and women.\" But you never heard the \"middlewomen\" before; you heard \"middlemen.\" That's the term.\nAnd you know, say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product. They produce the pill. They produce the medicine—the medication. But these people make billions and billions of dollars. I don't know who they are, but they're very rich. But they won't be so rich anymore.\nThis Executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients. So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I'm going to lose a lot of friends, even though I have no idea who these people are. [Laughter]\nOn opioids, I'm pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America. In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic. And we've done very well. We've done—it was prior to the virus—we were down 18, 19, and 20 percent. But when you think about it, that means that you have 80 percent, and that's not acceptable.\nThe wall is going up. We have 276 miles of wall. It's having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already. It will be finished toward the end of the year. And it's had a very, very big impact.\nNo. You, go ahead.\nYes.\nYes, it could be by the end of the week. They're being drawn by the lawyers right now. They work very nicely. It would be nice to be able to do it with the Democrats, but they're really just interested in one thing, and that's protecting people that have not done a good job in managing cities and States. And nothing to do with COVID, nothing to do with—or little to do. They want to be able to make up for many, many years—in some cases, decades—of bad management. We can't do that.\nSo that's what they want. They want to do that, and we don't want to do that.\nNo, not at all.\nNo. If somebody—well, you always get sued. I mean, everything you do you get sued. I was sued on the travel ban, and we won. I was sued on a lot of things, and we won. So we'll see. Yes, probably, we get sued, but people feel that we can do it.\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.\nPotential Foreign Interference in the 2020 Presidential Election/Russia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations/Iran/North Korea/National Economy\nIt could be. I mean, it could be—very much. I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.\nWell, I don't care what anybody says. Nobody with any common sense would say, do—look at what we've done with our military. Look at what we've done in exposing the pipeline with billions of dollars going to Russia. Look at all of the things we've done with NATO, where I've raised $130 billion a year from countries that were delinquent, and now they're paying all of this money. And the 130, by the way—$130 billion—not \"million,\" \"billion\"—goes to $400 billion over a few years. And that's all money to protect against Russia.\nChina would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost to Sleepy Joe Biden. They would dream—they would own our country. [Laughter] If Joe Biden was President, China would own our country. And you said another country? What was the third country?\nIran would love to see me—Iran would love to see me not be President. And I'll make the statement: If and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly. We'll make deals with North Korea very quickly.\nAnd whatever happened to the word \"North Korea\"? You haven't seen that, have you? If I didn't win the election in 2016, our country would now be—maybe it would be over by now, but in war with North Korea. Everybody said, \"Oh, Trump will get us in war.\" No, it's just the opposite.\nAnd we actually have a relationship with North Korea, which is something that—it was never established by the previous administration. You would have been in war with North Korea, and it would have been a very bad war.\nSo North Korea—whether you look at Iran—every one of them will make a deal with us very quickly. Iran is dying to make a deal, but they want to see, because they'd much rather make a deal with Biden. Because if they make a deal with the United States, if China makes a deal with the United States with Biden in charge, they would own our country.\nLook what I've done. I've taken billions—tens of billions of dollars from China. China was having the worst year they've had in 67 years, and we were having the best year we've ever had—with big tax cuts, with big regulation cuts. We've rebuilt our military. We became independent in terms of energy. We're the energy leader of the world. We were having the best year we've ever had.\nBy the way, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American unemployment numbers—the best in the history of our country. All things—and many other groups too—including women; including high school diploma, no high school diploma, college diploma. Everybody was doing better.\nThe last thing that Russia wants and China wants and Iran wants would be for Donald Trump to win.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWell, we're going to look at it very closely. You're telling me that this came out a little while ago, and I've heard that it came out. It came out just a little while ago, and we're going to look at that very closely.\nBut you started off with Russia.\nWhy don't you start off with China? Do you think China is may be a bigger threat? I mean, I think maybe it is. I mean, you'll have to figure it out. But we're going to watch all of them. We have to be very careful.\nThe biggest risk that we have is mail-in ballots, because with the mail-in ballots—it's called \"universal mail-in ballots\"—it's much easier thing for a foreign power, whether it's Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, many others, people—countries you wouldn't expect—it's much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in. It's much easier for them to cheat with universal mail-in ballots.\nSo I think one of the things we'll have to look at is exactly that, but that's a big problem. That's a big problem. And you saw, in New York, they called the winner, but they have no idea what the vote is.\nPlease, go ahead.\nNo, I'm totally involved. No, I—they call me all the time. They tell me how they're doing with Nancy and Chuck. But in my opinion, they're just using it as an excuse to try and—you know, Chuck Schumer came out with a strong statement today that you have to get back into school because it's good for the economy, but he has—he doesn't do it. He doesn't practice what he preaches.\nNo, my people—Steve Mnuchin and our wonderful Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows—they're constantly on the phone with me. I'm totally involved with it. And we are going to do it in a way that's just much easier. We gave them their chance, but they view it as an election enhancement.\nYou know, you talk about foreign countries cheating on the election. Well, the Democrats are cheating on the election, because that's exactly what they're doing. If you look at what they're doing, even with these negotiations, that's an influence and an unfair influence on an election. But we're going to win anyway.\nWell, we'll see. We'll see what happens, but right now they're not ready. And they're not ready because, frankly, I don't think they care about people. I think they care about their politicians that have done a terrible job running the cities and States—Democrat cities and States—that are bleeding money, that have been so badly run.\nYou take a look at Baltimore, and you take a look at so many different cities, including the ones I've already mentioned. Take a look at what's going on. And they want lots of money to keep it going. For many years, they've been bad.\nSo all I'm doing is, we're having it out. We're finally having it out.\nYes, please.\nYes, we have the money. We have the money. Yes.\nI won't say that yet. You'll see that when it happens, but we have the money.\nNo, they don't have to. This is a political activity.\nAudience members.Booo!\nYes. You're wrong on that, because it's a political activity. They have exceptions. Political activity.\nAnd it's also a peaceful protest. [Laughter] So when you have an—and as you know—it's a peaceful protest. They asked if they could be here.\nYou know, they—a number of—and, to me, they look like they all have—pretty much all have masks on. But you know, you have an exclusion in the law. It says \"peaceful protest\" or \"political activity,\" right? In fact, specifically—yes. It says—exactly—\"political activity\" or \"peaceful protests.\"\nAnd you can call it \"political activity,\" but I'd call it \"peaceful protests\" because they heard you were coming up. And they know the news is fake. They understand it better than anybody.\nAudience members.Yes! [Applause]\nThey asked whether or not—they asked whether or not they could be here. Like the question about Russia. He doesn't mention Iran was in the report. He doesn't mention—or he mentions very late that China was in the report——\nAudience member.China wants Biden!\n——because that's the way they are. They're not——\nIf the press in this country were honest, if it wasn't corrupt, if it wasn't fake, our country would be so much further ahead. But we're doing really great. [Applause]\nThank you all very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey", "Date": "2020-08-08", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, and good afternoon. My administration has been working around the clock in good faith to reach an agreement with Democrats on additional China virus relief.\nAlready, my administration has enacted over $3 trillion in historic relief, saving many tens of millions of dollars and jobs. And you see how fast the economy is coming back. It does look like it's going to be a very sharp \"V.\" We have tremendous enthusiasm, tremendous spirit, and tremendous job growth. We set a record on number of jobs in the last 3 months. It's the most jobs ever created in a 3 month period—during a 3 month period. That's great.\nBefore we begin, I've just signed two bills that are great for our vets. Our vets are very special. We passed choice, as you know—Veterans Choice—and Veterans Accountability. And they've been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades, and no President has ever been able to do it. And we got it done so veterans have choice. And now you have accountability—that if you don't love your vets, if you're in the VA and you don't love the vets or take care of the vets, you can actually get fired if you don't do your job. We want people that love our vets.\nThe first expands the eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes. So we have an expansion of benefits, an expansion of various elements of being and working with the VA for vets with blindness and—in particular, blindness in both eyes. And we have a lot of problems with blindness in the VA, and we're doing something about it. They've been talking about this for many years. So that is expanding eligibility for vets with blindness in both eyes. Okay?\nSecond is—requires the VA to establish a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes. And you know what that all means, and it's really something that they've been trying to get done for a long time. The second requires the VA to establish a treatment court. So this is a treatment court program for vets who need treatment rather than punishment for certain nonviolent crimes. Okay? I think it's self-explanatory.\nWe've wanted this for a long time, they've been trying to get it for a long time, and now we have it. And I want to thank everybody for helping us get that done. We had a lot of support from a lot of great people, including people in the VA.\nIn the current negotiations, we have repeatedly stated our willingness to immediately sign legislation providing expanded unemployment benefits, protecting Americans from eviction, and providing additional relief payments to families. Democrats have refused these offers; they want to negotiate. What they really want is bailout money for States that are run by Democrat Governors and mayors and that have been run very badly for many, many years and many decades, in fact. You know the States; everybody knows who we're talking about and what we're talking about. I don't think we have to go over it.\nBut what the Democrats primarily want is bailout money. It has nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing to do with anything that we've been talking about over the last period of time. They want to bailout States that have been badly managed by Democrats, badly run by Democrats for many years and, in fact, in all cases, many decades. And we're not willing to do that. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have chosen to hold this vital assistance hostage on behalf of very extreme partisan demands and the radical-left Democrats, and we just can't do that. So, hopefully, we can do something with them at a later date, but we're going to be signing some bills in a little while that are going to be very important, and will take care of, pretty much, this entire situation as we know it and as you have been covering it in some cases, actually covering it accurately.\nMany of the far-left policies they're pushing have nothing to do, again, with what we have been working on so hard, namely, the corona. You can call it so many different names. What a horrible thing China released upon the world.\nOne third of their bill—the Heroes Act—is spending completely unrelated money to the virus. Here are just a few of the policies in their extreme-left bill. And, again, this is a bill supported by Biden, and Biden is totally controlled now by the Bernie Sanders left wing of the party. And, in fact, he's gone further left than Bernie Sanders ever dreamt of going. So, obviously, other than Bernie have brought him left. If you look at the manifesto that they've agreed to, it's far further left than I've ever heard anything about Bernie Sanders.\nThe massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue States we talked about; that's one of the things they're looking to do. Measures designed to increase voter fraud. Banning voter ID; they want to ban voter ID. We should have voter ID in every State. Every State should have voter ID. You have ID on everything you do, practically, yet every—everybody has voter ID. Everybody has ID except for voters. When you vote, you don't want ID; they don't want.\nWe have some States with it; it works out great. And if you want to stop fraud in elections, have voter ID. They want measures designed to increase voter fraud, which is banning voter ID in all States and banning requirements for signature verification in Federal elections.\nNow, why would they want, in this bill—which really has nothing to do with what we're talking about: stimulus—something banning voter ID? In every single State, they want to ban it, including States where we already have it, because we have some States where we have it: Indiana and others that do very well.\nWhy would they want to ban voter ID in all States? And why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in Federal election? Who would want a bill banning signature verification? What's that all about?\nYou know what it's about? Fraud. That's what they want: fraud. They want to try and steal this election because, frankly, it's the only way they can win the election.\nThe bill also requires all States to do universal mail-in balloting—which nobody is prepared for—regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure. They want to steal an election. That's all this is all about: They want to steal the election.\nSo, in the bill, they have a bill that requires all States to do universal mail-in balloting, regardless of whether or not they have the infrastructure. Like in Nevada, it's such a disaster. Their infrastructure is a total disaster. They don't want to have signature verification, they don't want to have any of the safeguards that you need, and they don't want to have safeguards that are so common and so basic and even other States that we disagree with have. This Nevada thing is a mess, but we'll see how the courts determine—what the courts determine. But they certainly don't have the infrastructure in Nevada. So we'll see how it is.\nAs you know, we brought suit last week, and we'll see how that all works out. I think we're going to win it. But basically, what they're trying to do with all of these requirements, including no signature verification: They're trying to steal an election. And I was in Ohio, I was in Texas, I was in Florida over the last 4 or 5 days. And if you would see the crowds along the highways and the roadways, people have said they've never seen anything like it, and they haven't seen anything like it. And the press doesn't report it because they're fake news. [Laughter]\nThey even want to force States to implement the controversial practice known as \"ballot harvesting\"—a very dangerous practice—meaning they would allow Democrat Party operatives to deposit thousands and thousands of completed ballots at the post office without any verification of who filled them out, including a verification of signatures on the ballot. So you're not even going to have a verified signature. Anybody—I could sign it. You could sign it. Anybody in this room could sign it. And that's going to count as a vote. How can you do a thing like this?\nSo this is what they're asking for. This is what Nancy Pelosi and Crying Chuck Schumer are asking for. [Laughter] Okay? It's ridiculous. It's horrible. It's a horrible thing.\nThe Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens. So if you were able to get into our country illegally—and our border is, as you know, doing very well right now. We have a very strong border, and the wall is up to 276 miles. And we'll be completed with it around the end of the year. We're going to do some extra mileage in certain areas that people didn't realize were so bad, so we'll be completed with it. Right after, we're going to do the additional mileage. We'll do it probably a little bit after the year.\nI think, from what I've heard, Joe Biden—Sleepy Joe—wants to rip the wall down. He wants people to pour into our country. They want to have open borders. We don't want to have open borders.\nSo the Democrat bill includes stimulus checks for illegal aliens. They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. They also compel the mass release of inmates, including serious felons. How do you like that one? And this is in the bill that we're talking about? What does this have to do with stimulus, the economy? What does this have to do with the coronavirus? Another name. What does this have to do with this?\nSo think of that: They require the mass release of illegal aliens from detention. What does this have to do with what we're trying to do? They want to put this—and this is a radical-left policy so they can go to Portland and try and rip the place apart that they've been doing for many years and they've been doing for years and years.\nThey also compel the mass release of inmates. What does this have to do with what we're talking about? This is Nancy Pelosi—Crazy Nancy—and Chuck Schumer. They want to compel you to do this stuff, and this has nothing to do with what we're talking about, and it includes serious felons. They want to have these people released on a mass basis, including serious felons.\nThat's page 1,689; page 1,762. Think of it: 1,762. And that's nowhere near the end of their bill. They have things in there that nobody has even at the time to look at or read. These people—I don't—I honestly don't believe they love our country, if you want to know the truth.\nIn addition to demanding these extreme partisan provisions, Democrats are actively blocking the following measures: support for K-12 schools to help them safely open, additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program to help millions of workers on the payroll. This is a great program. Very successful. Kept a lot of businesses open. That's why we're doing so well in reopening our country. Additional money for hospitals. Testing and vaccines. Direct payments of $3,400 for a family of four.\nNow, remember, this is what the extreme partisans—this—we've got—we have to—this is what we're talking about. Democrats are actively blocking the things that we want. And what we want is good for people. Those—these are things that they're blocking: support for K-12 schools, so they can open. Think of that.\nAlso, direct payments of the $3,400 for a family of four-plus, then funding for childcare and mental health care. And you need that, especially when you have so much of a lockdown. You need that: mental health care.\nFunding for broadband, airports, and agriculture, rental assistance, and support for community banks and credit unions to help them provide $100 billion in loans to the hardest hit communities, including rural communities and farmers. They don't want anybody to get that. Democrats are obstructing all of it.\nTherefore, I'm taking Executive action. We've had it. And we're going to save American jobs and provide relief to the American workers, and I'll be signing these bills in a very short period of time.\nFirst one is on providing a payroll tax holiday to Americans earning less than $100,000 per year. In a few moments, I will sign a directive, instructing the Treasury Department to allow employers to defer payment of the employee portion of certain payroll taxes from September 1. And we're actually going to be making that; we just got the word. We're just getting some word from a lot of people. We didn't think we'd have to do this, because we thought the Democrats would be reasonable, but they've been not only unreasonable, they've been ridiculous.\nSo we're going to make that August 1, most likely. It'll be August 1. We'll let you know the exact date, but we're looking like August 1. So it'd be August 1 through the end of 2020. This will mean bigger paychecks for working families, as we race to produce a vaccine and eradicate the China virus once and for all.\nAnd we're doing very good with the numbers. You see it's going down in Arizona very, very substantially and rapidly, going down in California, going down in Texas, going down in Florida. Other areas are propping up a little bit, but we're watching them very closely. We understand the disease, and we're watching them very closely, especially our senior citizens and our senior citizens' residences.\nIf I'm victorious on November 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax. So I'm going to make them all permanent.\nNow, Joe Biden and the Democrats may not want that. They don't want that, because they're adding $3 trillion in taxes. So they'll have the option of raising everybody's taxes and taking this away.\nBut if I win, I may extend and terminate. In other words, I'll extend it beyond the end of the year and terminate the tax. And so, we'll see what happens. Biden probably won't be doing that; you'll have to ask him. I don't think he knows what he's doing. [Laughter]\nSecond, I'm signing an Executive order directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HHS, and CDC to make sure renters and homeowners can stay in their homes.\nSo I'm protecting people from eviction. Yet you've been hearing a lot about eviction, and the Democrats don't want to do anything having to do with protecting people from eviction. I said: \"Let's do that separately. That can be a totally separate thing from passing along money so people can live.\" And they didn't even want to protect people from eviction.\nSo they would get evicted—it's not their fault that this virus came into our country; it's China's fault. And came into the world—by the way, a lot of the people, a lot of the States that were doing the best are having some problems. A lot of the States that we weren't thinking were doing the best are doing very well. You look at some of the countries involved. Some of the countries that were really standing out as examples are now exploding. But they'll get it down; they understand it. We're dealing with them. We're dealing with a lot of countries.\nWe're providing thousands and thousands of ventilators all over the world right now. We make a lot of ventilators. We started off with very little, and we're making a lot. And we have thousands in our stockpile, but we're making thousands a month. And we're providing many of them—thousands and thousands—to other countries that would never be able to get them.\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development will also provide financial assistance to struggling renters and homeowners, and work with landlords and lenders to keep Americans safely in their homes. So we don't want people being evicted. And the bill—the act that I'm signing will solve that problem, largely—hopefully, completely.\nThe third action I'm taking today will also provide additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. Under the CARES Act, I proudly signed expanded unemployment benefits into law. Congressional Democrats have stonewalled our efforts to extend this relief. They even oppose measures that would give bonuses to workers returning to the job. They were totally opposed to that.\nFor this reason, I'm taking action to provide an additional or an extra $400 per week in expanded benefits: $400. Okay? So that's generous, but we want to take care of our people. Again, it wasn't their fault; it was China's fault.\nStates will be asked to cover 25 percent of the cost using existing funding, such as the tens of billions of dollars available to them through the Coronavirus Relief Fund. Under this plan, States will be able to offer greater benefits if they so choose, and the Federal Government will cover 75 percent of the cost. So we're all set up. It's $400 per week.\nAnd we're doing that without the Democrats. We should have been able to do it very easily with them, but they want all of these additional things that have nothing to do with helping people.\nFourth, I am signing a directive providing relief to student loan borrowers. Earlier this year, we slashed student loan interest rates to zero. I don't know if people know that because the press doesn't ever report it, but maybe they're watching now. [Laughter] The press doesn't report a lot of good things that are good for the people and good for the country.\nEarlier this year, we slashed student loans' interest rates to zero percent and suspended student loan payments, and Congress extended that policy through September 30. Today I'm extending this policy through the end of the year, and we'll extend it further than that, most likely, right after December 1. So we look like we're going to be extending that. They're paying zero interest. And again, not their fault that their colleges are closed down and not their fault that they're unable to get what they bargained for.\nThrough these four actions, my administration will provide immediate and vital relief to Americans struggling in this difficult time. And the beautiful thing about this difficult time is we're now coming back and setting records. We'll also ensure that our economic comeback continues full speed ahead. And with the $400 and all of the other measures that we're talking about and will be signing in a little while, that will happen.\nWe're further looking at additional tax cuts, including income tax relief, income tax cuts, and capital gains tax cuts. So we're going to be looking at that—capital gains—for the purpose of creating jobs, and income tax is self-explanatory. And it'll be income tax for middle-income and lower-income people, but middle-income people, because they pay a lot of income tax and you do have tax inequality. I'm saying that as a Republican, and you do have tax inequality. So we're going to be looking at income tax, and we're going to be looking at capital gains tax cuts on both and maybe substantial. And we'll be reporting back fairly shortly on that. That's big news. That's big news, but very important. We want to have our jobs flourish. We want to have our companies do great. We want to have the 401(k)s, which are now at a level—if you look at the stock market, it's great.\nIf you have stocks in NASDAQ, you're higher than you ever were, including even—this is still during the pandemic. The stock market—because they see such incredible things are happening, smart people—the stock market is that almost an alltime high. We're just short of it. And NASDAQ is higher than it ever was. It's broken the record 14 times in the last couple of months.\nSo 401(k)s are doing fantastically. I hope you kept your stocks. I hope you didn't sell. I hope you had confidence in your President and confidence that your President was going to be reelected.\nAnd I will tell you this, that the biggest tailwind, the biggest problem that we have, with respect to the stock market—which is not much of a problem because it's doing so well, but it would be actually much higher—is the possibility that these radical-left Democrats could win. And if they win, we're going to have a crash. We're going to have a terrible problem, because they're going to raise taxes: 3 trillion dollars' worth of taxes. And that's going to affect everybody from middle income to upper income, to jobs, to companies. Your 401(k)s will go down like a rock. Your stocks will go down like a rock.\nYou know, and don't forget: These big companies—you have stocks in these companies. You know, you own stocks. And they have millions and millions of shareholders. And whether it's pension funds or anybody else, you all have stocks. So there are big companies, but a lot of people own that stock, and we want to keep it going.\nBut we do have, I guess you could say, not a tailwind; it's a headwind—I guess would be a better description. But it is; it's a headwind. And when you think of it, that's—in my opinion, it would be much higher. But you look at what they want to do. They want to raise everybody's taxes—everybody. And they want to do the Green New Deal, which will decimate our country and decimate—it's ridiculous too. It's childish. I actually say the Green New Deal is childish. It's for children. It's not for adults. [Laughter]\nAnybody that believes in that is—I don't know, maybe it's politics. I don't even think it's good politics. They seem to think so. We'll see how they do. But I don't think it's good politics, and it will decimate our economy.\nWe've learned a great deal about this virus and how to treat it. Our strategy is to aggressively shield those at the greatest risk while allowing younger and healthier citizens to safely resume work and school.\nI noticed that some of the Democrats that I would say are very strongly on the left are now coming out and saying we really have to open our schools for the good of the economy. I was shocked to see a couple of them; you know they are.\nWe urge all Americans to socially distance and avoid large crowds and all of the things that we talk about all the time. We have to go and make sure that everything is in good shape. We really are: We're coming back very, very strong. We're doing very well with the virus, because all of those States that everybody thought would be in a bad position for a long time, they're all coming down. Governors have done a great job. Don't forget, we're dealing with Governors. Some have done a fantastic job. All have worked hard. Some have done a much better job than others. And someday, if you'd like to know, I'll give you the good ones and the bad ones. We'll give you some good ones and some bad ones.\nBut, by contrast, the never-ending lockdown being proposed by some, mostly—I guess you could almost say \"almost all\"—in the Democrat Party, would inflict unimaginable harm to our people and to our health for decades to come. It'll hurt our economy, and they view that as a good thing. They actually view that as a good thing because they're interested in one date: November 3.\nAnd I actually think it's bad politics, and I think they're starting to come along, because I'm seeing more and more people want to open up. And you see the devastating results of lockdowns, too. You know, you have depression and suicide and drugs and alcohol and bad marriages. Marriages that were very good turned out to be very bad. [Laughter]\nIt's an amazing thing, and it's—who would think it? But people get along for 20 years; I guess they didn't know each other very well, and now they're not getting along. [Laughter] And you had the opposite, also. You've had people to get along better. They like each other more than they thought. That's okay too. [Laughter] That, we like. But the other situation is very, very—very, very bad.\nWe'll develop a vaccine. We're going to have it very soon, and we're ready to distribute it. And we're got the military ready. \"Logistics,\" it's called. And we'll end this pandemic, and we will rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world.\nYou know, we created the greatest economy in the history of the world—the highest stock market ever. And we're very close to getting that back. That, I have to say, is way ahead of schedule. Highest stock market ever. Best employment numbers for African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans.\nAnd by the way, Hispanic Americans just set a record for new jobs. African Americans just set a record for new jobs just now, during the pandemic, the last month. And Asian Americans just set a record for new jobs. So we're very proud of what's happening.\nAnd I will now sign the Executive action. And then, if you want, we can ask a few questions.\nOkay, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. Yes, let me do this first, and then you can do some questions. Thank you very much.\nOkay, good. Okay, so this is for the authorization of other needs assistance program, major disasters declaration related to the coronavirus disease. Okay?\n[At this point, the President signed the memorandum.]\nSo this—authority invested in me—this is the payment relief during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n[The President signed the memorandum.]\nThis is fighting the spread of the COVID-19 by providing assistance to renters and homeowners. We're doing assistance.\n[The President signed the Executive order.]\nAnd this is deferral payroll tax obligations. So this is your payroll tax obligations, which we're going to end up terminating eventually, right?\n[The President signed a third memorandum.]\nHow many pictures can you take over there? [Laughter] I mean, you're taking hundreds of pictures. What are you doing? Okay.\nI will. I will.\nSo that's the story. Would anybody like a pen? Would anybody like a pen? Would anybody——\nAudience member.I do!\nWhy do we hand these—we'll hand these out to you in the back. Okay, fine.\nYes, please.\nWell, if they don't, they don't. That's up to them. But if they don't, they don't. That's going to be their problem. I don't think their people will be too happy. They have the money. So I don't think their people will be too happy. But if they don't, they don't.\nBut again, the States have the money. It's sitting there.\nAll right, Kelly.\nYes.\nWell, no, it's not a hardship. This is the money that they need, this is the money they want, and this gives them a great incentive to go back to work.\nSo this was much more than was originally agreed. The $600 was a number that was there. And as you know, they were diff—there was difficulty with the $600 number because it really was a disincentive.\nYes. Okay. It helps people greatly. It helps our country get back. And anybody that would say anything different, I think, is very foolish. Everybody wanted it. By the way, the Democrats want it. The Republicans want it. They just couldn't get it—they just couldn't come to an agreement, but everybody wants it.\nAnd the very important thing is, the people want it, and the people need it, actually.\nWell, the answer is yes, but we have money to do other things, and we have a lot of money that was unspent, and we'll be able to do things with the money that was unspent. We have significant money that was unspent, and we will be able to use that for different purposes.\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead.\nWe think it's going to be very rapid. We want it to be very rapid. It's going to be distributed in a way that—whichever the fastest way. There are various methods, and it will be rapidly distributed.\nI didn't say that. No, no. I didn't say that.\nI said—what I said is, people can do whatever they want. I guess maybe they'll bring legal actions; maybe they won't, but they won't win. They won't win.\nWell, I'm not saying they're not going to come back and negotiate. They might very well come back and negotiate.\nVery soon. They're going to see it very soon. Look, it's——\nThere it is. Right there.\nExcuse me. Excuse me. There it is, right there.\nGo ahead.\nOh, I don't think so.Q.Is this just political theater?\nI think this is going to go very rapidly through the courts.\nThis will go very—if we get sued. Maybe we won't get sued. If we get sued, it's somebody that doesn't want people to get money. Okay? And that's not going to be a very popular thing.\nNo. No.\nYou ever hear the word \"obstruction\"?\nThey've obstructed. Congress has obstructed. The Democrats have obstructed people from getting desperately needed money.\nGo ahead, please. Right here.\nNo, no. You're finished. [Laughter]\nGo ahead, please. Please. Go ahead.\nOkay, excuse me.\nGo ahead, please.\nOkay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-10", "Text": "Thank you very much. I thought I'd start by talking about some mail-in voting that just was revealed—just the news. Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the State of Virginia, including to many dead people. This was an unprecedented mailing flub that's heightened concerns about the integrity of expanding mail-in voting and mail-in voting efforts. It's a disaster: all over Virginia, half a million votes. So that's something you have to think about.\nWe don't want to have a rigged election, I know that. And you have to be very careful when you mention, as you constantly do, Russia or you mention China or you mention Iran or others that attack our election system. And when you have this mail-in voting, it's a—it's very susceptible. It's something that can be easily attacked by foreign countries and by, frankly, Democrats and by Republicans. And I think that it's something you have to start thinking about very seriously.\nOur system is not equipped for it. The Post Office is not equipped for it. And people should vote, like they did in World War I and World War II. And your numbers will be—in 90 days or less, your numbers will be very good, I think—much better—on the coronavirus or the China virus. But it's something you have to look about—look at and say, \"This is just crazy.\"\nThis just came out: half a million incorrect ballot applications sent all over the State of Virginia to many people that weren't living. They had some sent to pets, dogs. This is what we're going to get into, and it's going to be a disaster. And it's going to be thought of very poorly, and it's going to hurt our country.\nAfter our news conference Saturday night and the pro-growth announcement—we're pro-jobs, pro-health safety—Executive orders—the stock market went up 358 points today. So we—we issued those Executive orders, and the stock market went up 358 points today. It's quite a reaction.\nThe Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now up 50 percent since March—50 percent. Think: If you had money in there, if you put your money in in March, you have 50 percent. The NASDAQ index continues to set new records. It's been up over 14 times; new record in NASDAQ.\nAnd the S&P 500 and the Dow—Dow Jones are going to be—I mean, the way they're going, it looks like they're just about going to be topping records, hopefully, soon.\nSecret Service agent.Sir, we're just going to have to step out in the hall—[inaudible].\nExcuse me?\nSecret Service agent.We will step out outside.\nOh. Excuse me.\n[At this point, the President was escorted out of the room. Then, the President returned, and the press briefing resumed.]\nSo thank you very much. Sorry for that. The—there was a shooting outside of the White House, and it seems to be very well under control. I'd like to thank the Secret Service for doing their always quick and very effective work. But there was an actual shooting, and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don't know the condition of the person. It seems that the person was shot by Secret Service. So we'll see what happens.\nAnd yes, did you have something? Go ahead.\nNo, we—there are no details. We just found out just now. It was outside of the White House, this area right over here. And they'll have details for you in a little while.\nSomebody is taken to the hospital. It seems that the shooting was done by law enforcement at that person, at the suspect. It was the suspect who was shot.\nAnd this just took place. A couple of people outside—I noticed a man named John Roberts [Fox News], who you know very well——\n——he reported that he heard shots. He was outside, and he heard two shots.\nWe don't know yet. We don't know. They're going to find that out.\nWe don't know that, yet. No.\nWe don't know that yet.\nIt seems to be. Yes.\nIt seems to be.\nNo, we were taken just out over to the Oval Office.\nShooting Outside of the White House/U.S. Secret Service\nJust told me, when he came up—you pretty much saw it like I did—he said, \"Sir, could you please come with me?\" So you were surprised. I was surprised, also. I think it's probably pretty unusual. But very, very professional people. They do a fantastic job, as you know. So it seems to me—it seems to be, from what I was said, there was a shooting. It was law enforcement shot someone—seems to be the suspect—and the suspect is now on the way to the hospital. I can't tell you the condition of the suspect.\nThere was nobody else injured. There was no other law enforcement injured. And I just want to—and we'll get on to the press conference, but I do want to thank Secret Service. They are fantastic, the job they do.\nFrom what I understand, the answer is yes.\nThat's what I understand. I don't know. You'll have to ask them that.\nI don't know that, no.\nI don't know. You'll have to get that—they'll have a detailed—maybe a briefing for you outside later.\nI don't know. I didn't ask that question. It might not have had anything to do with me. It might have been something else. But it was on the outside of the premises. The wall, the—as you know, the fencing, especially the new fencing that they put up, is very powerful. But it was on the outside of the White House.\nOkay? And they'll have a full report—Secret Service, in a little while, will have a full report.\nI don't know; do I seem rattled? It's unfortunate that this is a world—but the world has always been a dangerous place. It's not something that's unique. The world has been—you look back over the centuries, the world has been a dangerous place, a very dangerous place. And it will continue, I guess, for a period of time.\nNo, I feel very safe with the Secret Service. They're fantastic people. They're the best of the best, and they're highly trained. I don't know if anybody got to walk outside, but there were a lot of terrific-looking people ready to go if something was necessary, people at the highest level of law enforcement. There's nobody like these people.\nSo they just wanted me to step aside for a little while, just to make sure that everything was cleared outside, because it was right in this area.The President's Decision To Return to the Briefing Room\nWell, I didn't even think about not coming back. I said, \"Am I able to go back?\" And they said, \"You'd have to wait a little while.\" I waited a little while, as you know, in the Oval Office area. And I said, \"Can I get back now?\" And they said, \"Yes.\"\nAnd they have a lot of fortification outside, just in case. But it was one person. Okay?\nWell, they're going to be giving you a full briefing in a little while.\nI can only tell you, they're going to going to give you a briefing. It was outside of the premises, near the fence, but outside of the premises.\nYes, pretty close.\n——are now 50 percent above the March level. NASDAQ is setting new records. It's already broken the record, despite the situation of having the China virus.\nWe have new jobs are rising, and unemployment is falling faster than nearly anyone thought. And over the past 3 months, we've created over 9 million jobs, and that's a record—a 3-month record. If you add it up, it's a 3-month record, by far. And we've beaten expectations by 12 million. We're 12 million above expectations, which is pretty remarkable.\nToday we had great reports on new job openings. And there's clearly a housing boom, which has been incredible numbers in both housing, and an automobile boom. We've rarely seen anything like it, and it's going on right now in America.\nInventories are at rock bottom. Used car sales are at record levels. And we will have rebuilt—we're doing a rebuilding like nobody has ever seen. It's a big plus for manufacturing and construction. So construction is getting close to record territory. Manufacturing is doing very well. The car companies are doing great.\nVery happy for Michigan, the State of Michigan. We have a lot of car companies moving in. A lot of plants are being built and expanded in Michigan and Ohio. There is no reason why the economy can't grow at a 20-percent pace in the third quarter; that would be a record.\nAnd interestingly, it will be a number that's going to be announced before November 3. It gets announced probably around November 1, which is very interesting. But it's going to grow at a very substantial pace, based on all of the numbers we're looking at, and probably a lot more substantial than we originally thought.\nWe're creating new incentives for work and jobs, and we're also providing much-needed assistance to those who are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic contraction. And the contraction is now—while we have the pandemic, we have a lot of great things happening, in terms of the vaccines and therapeutics, as you know. And I think we'll be making tremendous progress over the next period of a few months.\nAnd certainly, before the end of the year, I think we'll have a vaccine before the end of the year, very substantially, and we may have a therapeutic resolvement very quickly. And frankly, that's the one I'd rather have faster because you'd go in, you'd give a transfusion or a shot to people that are very ill, and they'd be able to come out of the hospital the next day or a few days later.\nIf the States participate in our cost-sharing unemployment plan—we are going to be doing something very, very interesting with all of the things that we announced on Saturday. I don't have to repeat what they are; you know very well. And we've had some tremendous success already if you look at what's happening with the stock market, and people are very thrilled at what we're doing.\nWe'd like to get the Democrats to focus on other than what they're focusing on, which is a bailout of poorly running States. We have many great-running States, States that are setting records. And let's see what happens with respect to that.\nBut the—we're looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs. So we're looking very seriously at a capital gains tax cut and also at an income tax cut for middle-income families. We're looking at expanding the tax cuts that we've already done, but specifically for middle-income families, and you'll be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks, and I think it'll be very exciting.\nSo a capital gains tax is going to be—a lot of people put to work, and it would be a cut in the capital gains tax and also a cut in the middle-income income tax.\nSo I now want to just discuss a little, quick brief, and then we'll take a few more questions, but we took some. Who would have known we were going to take questions before we started, right? [Laughter] Is that right, Jennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News]? But that's the way it happens sometimes.\nWe want to discuss, if we might, the China virus. And the world continues its fight against this horrible plague. Countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. We have a rapid increase only in cases where—it's very interesting: Because we're so far ahead of testing, we have more cases. If we had much smaller testing, we'd have fewer, but we feel that having testing is a very important thing.\nIt's a great record to have. In many ways, we've tested, I guess, close to 65 million people right now, and nobody is even close to that number. No other country is close. India would be second, at 11 million, and they have 1.5 billion people. So we have the number-one testing anywhere in the world, by far. And we also have, I think, the highest quality test. We have a lot of different ones, but we have the highest quality, including the short-term and the lab test. The lab tests take a little bit longer.\nYes.\nSteve, what do you think?Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin.Within the next week or two, we think the States will be able to execute.\nWait, by the way, the gentlemen—you know everybody. You know Russell. You know—but this is Scott Atlas. Do you know that? Right?\nScott is a very famous man—[laughter]—who's also very highly respected—Stanford. And he's working with us and will be working with us on the coronavirus. And he has many great ideas. And he thinks what we've done is really good, and now we'll take it to a new level. And so it's great to have Scott working along with us. And we appreciate it very much, Scott. Thank you very much, Scott. Thank you very much.\nWhite House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas.Thank you very much.\nReally terrific.\nWe've had some great discussions.\nWe just had a meeting with the Governors, and they were very anxious to get money for the people in their States. And if they—depending on the State, we have the right to do what we want to do. We can terminate the 25 percent, or we don't have to do that. So we'll see what it is; it depends on the individual State.\nBut a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly. And I've instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to move as quickly as he can.\nRight?\nSo we'll get it done.\nYes, please.\nWell, I don't know if he was close or not—he or she. I don't know if it was a he or a she. But I have such confidence in these people; they're so good. And I don't think the person breached anything. It was on the outside grounds. So I don't believe anything was breached. I asked that question. So they were relatively far away.School Reopening Efforts/Coronavirus Transmission Among Children/National Economy\nNo.\nNo, because they may have, as you would call it, \"a case.\" It may be a case, but it's also a case where there's a tiny—it's a tiny fraction of death—a tiny fraction—and they get better very quickly.\nYes, they have—they may have it for a short period of time, but the—as you know, the seriousness of it, in terms of what it leads to, is extraordinarily small, very, very much less than 1 percent.\nJonathan [Jonathan Lemire, Associated Press], go ahead.\nYes, I think that, for the most part, they do very well. I mean, they don't get very sick. They don't catch it easily. They don't get very sick. And, according to the people that I've spoken to, they don't transport it or transfer it to other people or certainly not very easily.\nSo yes, I think schools have to open. We want to get our economy going. We have incredible numbers despite this. If we could get this going—I think it's a very important thing for the economy to get the schools going.\nJonathan, go ahead.\n2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./2020 Presidential Election/Polling Statistics\nWell, if you look at the manifesto that that they've come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do, very importantly, with aspects of religion and faith: I don't think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you just—you can't put that into the realm of a religious group of people, I will say that.\nAnd I think it's one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which—I'm not a big believer in polls. I wouldn't—if I was, I guess I wouldn't be standing here right now.\nAnd by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know, and Joe's are going down very rapidly. He'll have to come out of the basement, it looks like, pretty soon, because that—you know, it's one of those things.\nBut no, if you look at the manifesto—I call it the \"manifesto.\" A lot of people are calling it a \"manifesto.\" My opinion: It's further left than where Bernie was before. So normally, he'd be left, and you'd bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there—and I'm not only talking in terms of religion; I'm not talking, even, in terms of religion—but some of the things they have in the agreement made—and this was an agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe—it's a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country.\nIt will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. We will—it will be terrible for health care. Just terrible. You'll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country.\nYes.\nYes. Yes, but, I didn't say—I said, as an Executive order. I—as you said, I said, as an Executive order, it hasn't been done before. We want to be able to assure people that preexisting condition is always taken care of.\nAs you know, we've done tremendous things having to do with the individual mandate. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which really ended Obamacare, as it would be officially known, because the individual mandate was the biggest part. It was also the most unpopular part—where you pay for a terrible privilege of overpaying for insurance. You pay not to have to pay for your health care. And that was a disaster for people and a very unpopular—that was called the \"individual mandate,\" and we terminated that and—officially terminated that. And that was something that we have been given thanks for by many, many people.\nBut the individual mandate will always be with us. The individual mandate termination will always be—they can't start it up. In fact, I don't even believe—you'll have to tell me—I don't believe it's been challenged when we ended it.\nAnd preexisting conditions, the Republicans are 100 percent there. And I'll be issuing, at some point in the not-too-distant future, a very strong statement on that, probably in the form of an Executive order.\nJust a double safety net and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally, strongly in favor of preexisting condition—taking care of people with preexisting conditions.\nIt's a signal to people. It's a second platform. We have—preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100 percent by Republicans and the Republican Party. I think it's a very—I actually think it's a very important statement.\nYes, please.\nNo, we haven't sent out invitations. We're talking to them. As you know, I was on the phone with many of them yesterday with respect to Lebanon, which is truly one of the saddest, most catastrophic things I've ever seen. And they have no idea how many people have died. They're having revolution right now in that country. It's just a terrible thing. And—but I was—yesterday, 8 o'clock in the morning, we had a—our time—we had a big teleconference call. Some of those people were there.\nI'm much more inclined to do it sometime after the election. We were going to do it in September. They'd like to do it. We could do it through teleconference, or we could do it through a meeting. But I sort of am now suggesting—I told my people yesterday, actually, \"Why don't we do it sometime after the election when things are a little bit—you have a little bit more time to think about it,\" because that's very important.\nThe G-7 is very important.\nI don't know. But we have invited a number of people to the meeting. I certainly would invite him to the meeting; I think he's an important factor. But we will invite certain people that aren't in the G-7. Some people have already accepted.\nBut we're going to be doing it after the election. I think it's a better atmosphere to have a G-7. I think it's a lot—I think it's just a better, calmer atmosphere to have a G-7.\nYes, please.\nThey're hurting people very badly. This would have been so easy for them to do. And I saw that Senator Schumer said today, on a show—I don't know what show—but he said today on a show that we should meet; we should do something. But you know, where's he been for—how many weeks have you been negotiating, like 4?\nAnd they should do something; it would have been so much easier than doing it the way we did it. But we did something that's very important. And frankly, it's been well received—very well received.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes.\nWell, I think it's—I've been to Gettysburg numerous times. It's a national park; it's a national historic site. It's incredible. You know, it's the history. It's incredible, actually, to me. It was a very important place, and is a very important place in our country.\nSo we're looking at that, and we're looking at the White House. The White House would be very much easier for Secret Service. You see what just went on here. They're all here. Just like you have your seats; they have their seats at the White House. So there wouldn't be any expense or any extraordinary expense. And the White House would be a lovely place to do it, also.\nLeast expensive place that you could do it would be at the White House. This is a Government expense and I—you know, look, I watch—also with Government, I watch to make sure that we do what's right.\nBut we're looking at Gettysburg, and we're looking at the White House. And we have other sites too, but I think these would be two really beautiful sites.\nJennifer, please.\nYou could. You have plenty of room at both locations.\nI see John Roberts. John, you were outside. You said you heard shots fired before?\nAnd they were shots pretty much?\nAnd you definitely know the difference, I know that.\nThat's—you know the difference. I—you thought they were shots, John?\nI saw your report inside when I went inside. It was a good report too. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nJennifer, please.\nChina-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China/Global Coronavirus Pandemic\nYes, please.\nAnd, Jennifer, we're also talking, on the WTO—the World Trade Organization—China is treated much differently than we are. This should have been handled many years ago when it first happened, but they are treated as a nation that's developing. They're treated as what they call a \"developing nation,\" which gives them tremendous incentives and advantages over and above what the United States gets, and over and above what other countries get also. This is a developing nation? I don't think so. I don't think, for purposes of what we're talking about, it should be. And we are putting in—and we've already put in a request that China should no longer be declared a developing nation and have advantages over the U.S. And I told them that a year ago, and I told them that 2 years ago. And we put it in very powerfully that they should not have advantages over other countries, frankly, and assure—they're not going to have any more advantages over—this should have been done by numerous Presidents a long time ago, because it gives them a tremendous boost over everybody else, and it's a very unfair situation.\nNo, we are upset with China because of what they did. China was not good. And China will be—if you look at what's going to happen, whether it's Iran will make a deal with us in a month after the election is over if we win the election. But their greatest dream in the world is that Joe Biden wins, because they will own this country. China will own this country. North Korea will own this country. They will own our country.\nAnd they're all waiting to see the election. And if we make a—if we have a win in—on November 3, we will have a deal with, in my opinion, Iran within 1 month. And I don't know that we want to have a deal with China, to be honest with you. So I'm saying to myself, \"Gee.\"\nBut China wants us to lose very badly. And you know who else is not happy with us winning? Russia. The phony people that tell the story, the fake news stories about Russia—it was just reported, the numbers, I raised $400 billion extra in NATO. You know that. It went from $130 [billion]* to $400 billion—and that's a year—in order to strengthen up NATO. Nobody says that.\nWe became the biggest energy exporter. We are now—if you look at what we have, we're energy independent. So many different things. Our military is stronger than it ever was. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military.\nI exposed the terrible deal between Germany and Russia on the pipeline. Nobody even knew about the pipeline: Nord Stream 2. Nobody knew about it. Nobody talks about it. I said, \"What's this all about?\" So we protect Germany from Russia, and Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for energy, and it's a big portion of Germany's energy. If I was a person that was a German citizen, I would not be happy with that deal, because they're at a very big disadvantage.\nSo no, Russia would not be happy. And I can tell you that China would not be happy at all.\nAnd we've taken in tens of billions of dollars. There's your head of the Treasury—Steve, right? We've taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 10 cents from China, never—not even 10 cents. And $28 billion we gave to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were actually targeted. And we gave $28 billion, compliments of China, to our great farmers and ranchers because they were unfairly targeted by China in order to make a better deal with us. I said: \"We're not going to do that. We're going to—instead of making a better deal, we're going to tariff you at very high numbers: 25 percent, 10 percent, and actually numbers that could go up a lot.\"\nAnd we had a lot of money left over. After giving the $28 billion to the farmers and ranchers and some others, frankly, we had many, many billions of dollars left over, and we're still receiving that money. Even though we made the deal, we're still receiving that money.\nSo if we win the election, we'll have deals with a lot of countries very fast. They're just waiting to see who wins, because they are hoping—they are hoping that Joe Biden wins. Sleepy Joe. And if he wins, you know what's going to happen? China will own us. Our markets will crash. The 401(k)s will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing. Remember, stocks, there's—these big companies, they're owned by millions of people that are carpenters and policemen and farmers and lots of other people. And they are the ones that benefit by having a good stock market, probably more than anybody else.\nBut the 401(k)s, the stocks, the economy will be in a shambles. They want to raise taxes. They want to triple taxes. They want to raise the corporate tax, but they want to raise all taxes. Ultimately, they can't pay for what they want to do anyway, and what they're going to do is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things.\nWe're going to have 180 million people that are so happy with their private health care; they're going to lose it under this crazy plan that these people are proposing.\nSo you will have a crash like you've never seen before. And I've been very good at predicting these things.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nWell, they—they said China, Russia, Iran, and probably others. But because of the fake news, they seem to think Russia plays the best, so——\nSo what they do—it's all right. Well, I'm just saying, the way the politicians—look, the other day, they said—the three countries—they said China and Russia and Iran. And some reporter got up and said, \"Russia is meddling.\" I said: \"Well, didn't it mention China and Iran? Why didn't you mention them too?\"\nSo I don't know. You know what I'm telling you? I'll tell you who's meddling in our elections: The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail-in ballots that—where there's corruption all over the place.\nIf you check what happened in New York—a small—relatively small race with Carolyn Maloney. And they called her the winner the other day, because I was mentioning it at conferences and getting a lot of action on that statement.\nSo they called her; they declared her the winner. And they have no idea who won. And the person, her opponent, is very angry. But they had mail-in voting. And they had hundreds and, I think, even thousands of ballots that are missing, that were fraudulent.\nTake a look at the Carolyn Maloney race. Take a look at Paterson, New Jersey. Take a look now at this one in Virginia, where they mailed out 500,000 applications, and they're going to people that aren't supposed to be getting an application.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nRestrictions on Foreign Travel to the U.S./Coronavirus Containment Efforts\nRight——Q.——next week. Do you have any updates on when the travel restrictions to the EU are going to be lifted? It seems strange we're offering exemptions for professional athletes, but not to K-1 visa holders, the so-called, you know, \"fiancé\"——\nWell, we're trying to do the best we can. You have big sporting events, and that's good for our economy; that's good for us. And they do talk about certain exemptions, and they make sure everyone is perfectly tested and everyone comes in at a hundred percent.\nBut you know, we do make certain accommodations, because you do have star athletes, and that means a good thing for the country. That's economic development, et cetera. But we are working very closely with Europe and with other countries to see what's the best timing.\nDon't forget, I was the one that turned Europe off because they really—they lead the way. They led it much more so than we did. We were months following them. And—in terms of, they got hit earlier than we did. Quite a bit earlier than we did.\nSo I put the restrictions on Europe. I put the restrictions on China, which was a great thing to do, in retrospect. We're getting—I mean, that's—that was a very important day. Dr. Fauci said that was one of the most important days. And a lot of people didn't want me to do it, but we first put a ban on anybody from China coming in, and then we put a ban on Europe coming in.\nBut we're working very closely with Europe to see when that will all come off.\nYes, please.\nNo, I wouldn't have done that. I think it's been amazing what we've been able to do. If we didn't close up our country, we would have had 1½ or 2 million people already dead. We've called it right; now we don't have to close it. We understand the disease.\nNobody understood it because nobody has ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is, in 1917, they say, right? The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing, where they lost, anywhere from 50 to 100 million people. Probably ended the Second World War; all the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious.\nNo, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now, all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open, and you could be up to a million and a half or 2 million people right now—1½ to 2 million people.\nOur people have done a fantastic job, our consultants and our doctors. You know, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we've done with ventilators has been amazing. What we've done with medical equipment has been incredible. We've supplied the Governors. Nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn't get it. And you know, at the beginning, there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have.\nSo we would have lost—if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people. Multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable. But that's what would have happened had we kept it open.\nSo no, I think we're a very large country. We are—one person—and I say it all the time; a lot of people like to leave that out—one person is too many. It should have never happened. But they've done a—really, an extraordinary job. They'll never be given the credit—and I'm not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they've done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country. Really, an extraordinary job.\nAnd a lot of the Governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their States, and they go up, and I think I can tell you that a lot of the Governors have done an extraordinary job too.\nYes, please go ahead.\nBrazil-U.S. Relations/The President's Use of Tariffs\nYou have to—you can't—yes.\nWe haven't really discussed that too much, but at some point, we probably will be. And we don't want people tariffing us. And if they tariff us—although, I must tell you, I have a very good relationship with President Bolsonaro. He's great. He's—and I hear he's doing well. He's recovered from having COVID. \"Having COVID-19,\" as they say. And that's great. And send him my regards.\nI think that, as far as Brazil is concerned, if they do tariffs, we have to have an equalization of tariffs. And we are going to be presenting something having to do with tariffs and fairness in tariffs, because we have many countries, for many years, that have been charging us tariffs to do business, and we don't charge them. And it's called \"reciprocity.\" It's called \"reciprocal tariffs.\" And you may be seeing something on that very soon.\nDid you have one, OAN?\nOAN, please.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nOkay.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1252"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-11", "Text": "Thank you very much. Nice to be with you all. Good evening.\nBefore providing today's update on the China virus, I want to address the violence, looting, and rioting taking place in the Democrat-controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle. The mayors and Governors of these States and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death.\nNew York City has an army of great police. I know them very well. And the law enforcement and the New York's Finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job. If they do their job, if they're allowed to do their job, the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly. They do it well.\nThe mayor, Bill de Blasio, should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired without justification. They were fired. I guess that's part of \"Defund the Police\" by the Democrats. They should hire New York City's Finest back. You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do, actually, when it comes to terrorism and other things.\nTogether, the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs, and guardsmen available to quell any violence. They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs—again, if allowed to do their jobs. Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do their jobs. The Democrats or the radical-left Democrats—or both, because they're becoming one and the same, if you look at election results—the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left.\nThe city of Portland and the State of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and guardsmen available. Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available. So Seattle—city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people. They have to be allowed to do their job. I'm urging them to deploy these resources to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on—although a lot of the, unfortunately, fake news don't like to put it on, because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement. They have to put it on. They have to be honest with the people of this country.\nBut I'm offering all available Federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals. We have to be asked by the Governors or the mayors, and we'll be there very rapidly. It's ready, willing, and able. We're all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them. We'll do them very quickly. You saw what happened in Minneapolis; they ripped the city apart. When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately. It was immediate and lasted.\nThese acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent, left-wing extremism that you get to see if you're watching the right news program. Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of left-wing domestic terrorism. They really are anarchists. These are left-wing anarchists. They are anarchists. And I'm directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists—immediately, to stop them—and to work with the city and the State to get the job done.\nLocal authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately. We'll work with you. And the local authorities know who they are. They know where they come from. They know a lot about them. They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we're ready to help. If you need that help—you shouldn't need that help, actually. You should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well. Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job.\nWhat you're seeing in Portland and Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America. They want every city in America to resemble Portland, in a form. They want to pass Federal legislation gutting and hamstringing every police department in America. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. They want to end cash bail, close prisons, defund police departments or at least largely defund. You see that with New York. A billion dollars they took out of their police department, and crime has gone through the roof. And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens. If the left gains power, no city, town, or suburb in our country will be safe.\nOn the vaccine front, some very good news. Today I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time.\nWe heard an update from the top scientists in the Government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which, right now, aren't too thrilled with me. They're taking millions of dollars' worth of ads because I've created a favored-nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70 percent in some cases, numbers that have never been heard or thought of. So when you see those ads, remember: That means your drug prices are coming down. When you see ads attacking your President, it's very simple—that means drug prices are going to be falling very soon.\nThis evening I'm pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate. The Federal Government will own these vaccine doses; we're buying them.\nRecently, we also secured partnerships with Johnson and Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSX [GSK],* to support the large-scale manufacturing of their vaccines. Doing very well on those vaccines—tremendous promise in every single one of them, and we have many of them. And they're years ahead of schedule. This would have been—if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years.\nThree vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already, the final stage of clinical trials. This is the final stage. We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure rapid delivery. The military is ready to go. They're ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA, and we're moving very close to that approval.\nWe're on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses, as soon as the vaccine is approved, and up to 500 million shortly thereafter. So we'll have 600 million doses. Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history.\nWe've treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results which are incredible. We look to a reduction and reduced mortality rate by 50 percent and possibly even more than 50 percent.\nI urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate. We would really appreciate that, because it's been very successful—unbelievably successful—and we would love you to go and donate. As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible. You've seen the numbers. You see what's going on yesterday, today—and tomorrow, in my opinion. We're very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401(k) numbers and everything else.\nToday the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time, more than a 50-percent surge since just March. So we've increased by 50-percent more than since just March. It has gained approximately 9,500 points that same period—March—and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our Nation—think of that.\nAmerica's economy is incredible, and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations. Last quarter, the European Union's GDP decline was nearly 40-percent worse than the United States. So it's 40-percent worse than the United States. We've built such a strong base that we're able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world, by far.\nFrance's GDP decline was nearly 80-percent worse than ours. And Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States.\nNationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic, very substantial improvements. Since last week, 87 percent of the counties in the United States report declining cases. Think of that: 87 percent of the counties in the United States, they reported declining cases.\nMortality has declined by 7 percent, and hospitalizations are declining rapidly. States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25 percent. But all Americans must remain vigilant, practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible. Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask. And protect the elderly—always protect the elderly.\nSince the end of July, the 7-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20 percent, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe.\nLast week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in 3 months; not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media. The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62 percent since last week, unfortunately; and that is truly unfortunate. It's increased 82 percent in France, 113 percent in Spain, and 30 percent in the United Kingdom. Those are big increases. Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries. And in our country, they're going down. We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by—a short time.\nEven though America is the largest at-risk population—including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries—Europe has experienced a nearly 40-percent higher excess mortality rate than the United States. We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York tri-State area—which had a very, very hard time—and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe, thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill, something that the news doesn't tell you. They don't tell you that. They don't like to tell you that.\nThe United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world. India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people, has done 24 million. So we're at 66 million. And think of it: India is at 24 million, and India is second. The entire region of Latin America, comprising 33 countries, has conducted 25 million tests. Yet Latin America has more confirmed cases, by far, than the United States. As we safely restore our great economy and reopen our schools—and hopefully, we can watch colleges play football. We want to get football in colleges. These are young, strong people. They won't have a big problem with the China virus. So we want to see college football start, and hopefully, a lot of great people are going to be out there. They're going to be out there, playing football, and they'll be able to fight it off. And hopefully, it won't bother them one bit. Most of them will never get it, statistically. But we know we'll see more cases at some point, and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity, in addition to everything else that we're doing.\nSo college football, get out there and play football. People want to see it. And stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem, because people are not happy when that doesn't happen.\nYou look at the NBA and what's happening with the NBA and their poor ratings. I don't know; can't imagine why. But they didn't stand, they didn't show respect to our flag. They didn't show respect to our national anthem. And maybe that's having an impact, but you—just not good.\nThe NFL had its problems, 2 years ago, when that happened. They went way down in their ratings and their fans, and they struggled back. And now, all of a sudden, they're putting themselves in the same position. So stand for your flag, and stand for the national anthem, and I think you're going to do fantastically well. Because a lot of people aren't going to watch if you don't; I'm one of them.\nThat's why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death. We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population. We've learned that, I think, more than any single event, Scott. We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population, and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness, diabetes, in particular. And we are, at the same time, in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding. We're in great shape.\nOn the nursing-home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy. HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities as they continue to combat the China virus.\nWe have delivered over 1,800 rapid, point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes. And we are in the process of delivering these devices to all 15,000 Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing homes by the end of September. So they're going to have very, very rapid tests. They won't have to wait around 2 or 3 days or 4 days.\nAnd that number has come down very substantially, compared to what it was. When you send it to the labs, you get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it, and then to send it back. But we are now at a position where we're sending very, very rapid tests—5 minutes to 15 minutes.\nWe will care for America's seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics. And therapeutics are coming along very, very well. We think we have some great answers on therapeutics, and you'll be hearing that—about them in the very near future. I'm very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital, and you give a shot, or you do what you have to do with a, perhaps, transfusion. There's combinations of what you can do, and people get better. I like that very much. I like that very, very much.\nAnd that could even precede—and it's successful in getting it—that will, I think, probably, even precede vaccines. But therapeutically, we're doing very, very well. A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that we're—that I'm seeing, and some of the results.\nSo tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front, and our country should be very proud of itself. We're going to get it delivered very rapidly, as soon as it comes out.\nYes.\nNo, we are not allowing that to happen. We're stopping evictions. We are stopping evictions. We're not going to let that happen.\nWe're not going to evict people. We're not going to let people—the Democrats, maybe they don't care, but I care. And we signed an Executive offer—you know, Executive order. You know that, right? And we are not letting people be evicted.\nPlease.\nSure.\nThat she was a what?\nOh.\nWell, she lied. I mean, she said things that were untrue. She is a person that's told many, many stories that weren't true. She's very big into raising taxes. She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody has—can even believe. She is against fracking. Fracking is—she's against petroleum products. I mean, how do you do that and go into Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great State of Texas? She is against fracking; fracking is a big deal.\nShe is in favor of socialized medicine, where you're going to lose your doctors, you're going to lose your plans. She wants to take your health care plans away from 180 million Americans, 180 million Americans that are very happy with their health insurance. And she wants to take that away.\nSo she was my number-one pick. I mean, she was—as they would say, because, hopefully, you'll start college football—she was my number-one draft pick. And we'll see how she works out.\nShe did very, very poorly in the primaries, as you know. She was expected to do well, and she was—she ended up at right around 2 percent and spent a lot of money. She had a lot of things happening. And so I was a little surprised that he picked her. I've been watching her for a long time, and I was a little surprised.\nShe was extraordinarily nasty to Kavanaugh—Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing. The way she was—the way she treated now-Justice Kavanaugh. And I won't forget that soon.\nSo she did very poorly in the primaries, and now she's chosen. So let's see how that all works out.\nI can't tell you what she's voting for. I don't think she knows what; I think Joe knows even less than she does. But I was only surprised at the pick. A lot of people were saying, \"That might be the pick.\" I was more surprised than anything else, because she did so poorly. Many people did much better than her in the primary. She did very poorly in the primaries. And that's like a poll. [Laughter] You know, that's like a poll.\nGo ahead.\nTremendous FISA abuse, yes.\nSo as far FISA abuse is concerned, there was tremendous FISA abuse. It's amazing that it's taken this long. And everyone knows that it's been proven very substantially. Not only FISA abuse, changing documents and putting documents in front of the FISA Court and courts that are disgraceful that they could have done it.\nAnd the fact is we caught Joe Biden, President Obama, the whole group. You can look at Brennan and Comey and Clapper, the whole group. We caught them spying on our campaign. This was an illegal act like no other illegal act. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason. And Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies of the United States Government to do it, both before and after the election. So before the election and then after I won, they continued. It's totally illegal activity, and now we just have to see what's happening.\nBut as far as Kamala is concerned, she's a big tax raiser, she's a big slasher of funds for our military, and she's got a lot of difficult things that she's going to have to explain. Plus, she was very, very nasty to—one of the reasons it surprised me, she was very—she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden. And it's hard to pick somebody that's that disrespectful. When she said things during the debates—during the Democrat primary debates—that were horrible about Sleepy Joe. And I would think that he wouldn't have picked.\nOAN, please. Please. Thank you very much.\nWell, I think that Seattle, in spite of all that they've been through, with the embarrassment of having a radical left group—Antifa and others—take over a big portion of the city of Seattle—we're talking about a big city, a major city. That they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. And the only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day, and so they preceded us. They didn't want that to happen. They don't want to be embarrassed. And the people just gave up. They weren't—they were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long.\nThe police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50 percent. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department, really, where people are saying it's not sustainable as a good police department. And, again, those police are good also, but they're not allowed to do their job.\nSo I think it's a shame. I hate to see her go, because she did, in her own way, a very good job, but she wasn't effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.\nThey've done a big—a big defund, a big part of it. And it will probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic error, before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle has made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they're doing. They have no clue. And hopefully, there'll be asking for help, because we can solve their problem very, very quickly.\nYes, go ahead.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1253"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-12", "Text": "Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here, and good evening. As we continue to confront the China virus, we're rebuilding America's economy like nobody thought possible, actually. We're doing incredibly well.\nThe stock market is up almost 300 points again today. While our economy is performing significantly better than Europe—which people have to understand—very strongly; it's performing better than any market anywhere in the world actually. At the same time, Europe has experienced a 40-percent higher excess mortality than the United States. And I will say that that's a significant number. We're working with Europe on their difficulties, and we are going to help them all the way.\nWe're doing very well, as you know, on the vaccines and the therapeutics. But think of that: We have the strongest economy—performing economy in the world. We're up—I think it's $9 trillion since March—$9 trillion in value. That's a number that nobody has ever heard of before. We're also getting close to about a 50-percent number since March, which is incredible. So it's $9 trillion. It's almost 50 percent. In fact, I think it went above 50 percent today with the 300-point increase. And it's—so we're doing much better than Europe, significantly. And at the same time, Europe has experienced a 40-percent higher excess mortality than the United States.\nI just want to mention because another number of judges were approved recently. We'll be, probably, over 300 judges—Federal judges, including Court of Appeals judges—approved by the end of my first term. And other than they—when they added new judges into somebody's term, which happens seldom, but we have more than any—this is a record. Nobody has ever seen anything like this in one term. So we're going to have over 300 Federal judges, and that's Court of Appeals judges, and that's just in the first term. It's—probably, we'll finish out over 300, which is pretty amazing.\nThe stock market's rebound signals a \"V\"-shaped recovery, stronger than our competitors anywhere in the world—stronger.\n[At this point, the President indicated the chart displayed on a screen.]\nIf you look, you'll see exactly what we have. We lead the world. Japan is second. But in terms of dollar value, it's not even close. So there it is. A lot of great competitors: Europe, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong. The United States is leading the world, very substantially.\nOn the second slide, you'll see the virus-induced economic contraction in the United States has been far less severe than it was with our peers and peer nations. And you see that, right there; there's the United States. And that's despite the fact that we've done more testing than any other nation in the world, that we've done more, by far, ventilators. We're building thousands and thousands of ventilators a month, and we're distributing them all over the world. We're helping other countries.\nBut despite all of these factors, the shallowest contraction, which is a big deal. I'm sure you'd love to put them in your various media outlets. I know you want to get that out. If you want to leave the room early and do that, that would be fine. The rapid recovery—but it would be nice to report it.\nThe rapid recovery of homebuilders' sentiment points to massive new construction. And we are doing massive amounts of construction of new homes, and that's because people have tremendous confidence. This is where we went, and the housing market has quickly rebounded. We were at a record, and now we're going to be at a record again very shortly. Those numbers are incredible. That's where we are. And we had to turn off the economy, and now we're turning it back on, and that's beyond a \"V\" shape. This is going to be very strong; it's called a \"strong 'V.'\"\nAutomobile demand has increased 65 percent over the last 3 months—65 percent, automobile demand. And we're anticipating that that's going to go up even further, but that's more than any—anybody else. The manufacturing sector—remember, \"manufacturing is dead,\" according to the past administration of Obama and Biden. \"Manufacturing is dead. You'd need a magic wand.\" Well, you don't need a magic wand. You need competence and capability. The manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at the highest reading since October of '18, which is—was a—an extraordinary period of time.\n[The President indicated another chart on a screen.]\nAnd there we are. That's pretty good. These are numbers that nobody has seen until just recently, and now they're just coming out. These are numbers that are leading—I guess, the stock market people, they're very smart people. I know many of them, and they're seeing things that they don't even believe. So the manufacturing sector is booming, and the Production Index is at its highest reading in a long, long time.\nThe economy generated over 9 million jobs in the last 3 years—a record, by far—and 12 million more jobs than experts predicted. So there you are. You look at that, and that's a record, and it's a record for the quarter. We had over 9 million, substantially more than 9 million jobs.\nSo those are incredible numbers about our economy and how it's coming back. It's coming back very strongly, and it's coming back at a level that's far greater than anybody anticipated. And we're very proud of that. And I give a lot of credit to all of our people—Steve and Larry.\nAnd we'll be talking about it. If you have any questions on it—shouldn't have any questions. I didn't print those charts. Who did? The economy generated—let's see. I don't know. We'll find that out for you, but it wasn't us. We took those—we took those numbers from somebody. Where did you get those numbers, Larry? They're from where?\nBLS jobs report.\nOkay. Everybody has that—everybody who needs?\nThe Democrats have abandoned the American people over the simple subject of politics. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are holding the American people hostage over money for their radical leftwing agenda that the country doesn't want and won't accept.\nFor example, they've asked for a ridiculous $3.5 billion—that's billion—$3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting, a system riddled by fraud and corruption. You just look at what happened with the Carolyn Maloney race. They should do that race over, by the way. I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race. When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing, and the ballot frauds—nobody knows what's going on with that race, and yet they declared her a winner. So her opponent—I don't know what's happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy.\nAnd then, you look at what happened in Virginia, where they have 500,000 applications sent out at random to people that have no idea what happened. And they admitted they made a mistake. And many were sent to dead people, and many were sent to—a number was sent—I guess, two—that at least two, three, four were sent to dogs. One was sent to a cat. [Laughter] They're sent all over the place. That was in Virginia.\nIn Paterson, New Jersey, they had a massive amount of voter fraud. And it's been a disaster. Paterson, New Jersey has been total disaster; that's universal mail-in voting.\nSo they want $3.5 billion for universal mail-in voting for the country, where you have hundreds of millions of voters. They can't do a little race with 20,000 people; now they want to take it countrywide. Mail-in voting—it's going to be the greatest fraud in the history of elections. When you always talk about \"Russia, Russia, Russia,\" China, Iran on voting—your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats, not with China, Russia, and Iran. Your biggest problem is going to be with the Democrats.\nBut now the Democrats—they want $3.5 billion, think of it. But now that they're unwilling to approve a bill that gives all of that money—of course, we would never approve an amount like that. And they also want $25 billion additional for the Post Office, Steve. Twenty-five billion for the Post Office so the Post Office can handle this vast amount of ballots that are being sent, at random, all over the place. They have no idea where they're going.\nSo they want $25 billion, and they want—think of this: They want $3.5 billion. Would you say that's enough to cover it? I think we could do it for less, right? I think we could do it for less. But they want $25 billion for the Post Office because of this.\nAnd remember, the new man—who is a great person, a great businessman—he just got there a little while ago. The Post Office has been run poorly for many, many decades. Great people in the Post Office, incredible people, but they've had very bad leadership for many years. So we'll get it straightened out.\nBut they turned down this bill, because they want radical-left agenda items that nobody in their right mind would approve. So they want $25 billion for the Post Office. They want $2.5 or $3.5 billion for universal mail-in—$3.5 billion. And the bill is not going to happen because they don't even want to talk about it, because we can't give them the kind of ridiculous things that they want that have nothing to do with the China virus. It has nothing at all to do with China virus, much of what they're asking for. So therefore, they don't have the money to do the universal mail-in voting. So therefore, they can't do it, I guess. Right?\nAre they going to do it even though they don't have the money? They're asking for the $3.5 billion. They're asking for $25 billion for the Post Office so they can do this, I guess, and other things. At $25 [billion],* I would hope it would be a lot of other things too.\nBut therefore, they don't have it. They don't have the money to do the universal mail-in votes. It will be the greatest rigged election in history. It will be the greatest fraud ever perpetrated, other than perhaps what they did to my campaign, where they spied on my campaign: President Obama, Biden, and everybody else. And they got caught. Let's see what happens. This will be one of the greatest frauds in history.\nSo they're admitting that they want $3.5 billion, and they're not going to do a deal that's good for the American people. Therefore, they're not going to get the $3.5 billion. Therefore, they can't do the universal mail-in vote. It's very simple. How are they going to do it if they don't have the money to do it?\nThe Democrats are also holding up money for schools and hospitals and small businesses and State and local governments. They tried to stop Americans from getting unemployment insurance and protection from evictions, which is why I took this decisive action. And I did Executive orders, which are now in full force in effect, and they're going forward.\nI signed a directive to provide a total of $400 of additional support for Americans who are unemployed due to the China virus. That's $400 more than the Democrats have provided. Remember that: That's $400 more than the Democrats have provided.\nNancy and Chuck haven't provided anything. And remember this: President Obama, when we had a problem—a pretty big problem, a very big problem—you know what he gave? Twenty-five dollars. He gave 25 bucks. So now they say, \"Well, we want to give $500 or we want to give $600.\" They don't want to give. They don't even give anything. They're not doing anything.\nBut President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe—gave $25. Twenty-five. And they'll complain, \"Oh, we want to give more.\" Well, we're giving $400, and that's now in the works, and that will be getting out to the people soon, Steve. Okay? Remember that: $25 is what they gave the last time. Twenty-five.\nI want to make it unmistakably clear that I'm protecting people from evictions. They didn't want to do that. The Democrats didn't want to do a protection from evictions—people getting evicted because of the coronavirus or the \"China virus,\" whatever you want to call it. We have 20—now we're up to 21 different names. All we know is it came out of China, and it shouldn't have. They should have stopped it.\nUnder my Executive order, HUD, HHS, and CDC have been directed to ensure renters and homeowners that they can stay safely in their homes. They're not going to be evicted. They are not going to be evicted. And those letters have already been sent out, Steve, so you'll make sure of that.\nI'm providing a payroll tax holiday to all Americans earning less than $100,000 per year, meaning bigger paychecks for working families through the end of 2020. That's a tremendous amount of money that's being supplied and given to families. Tremendous.\nThe Democrats didn't want to do a payroll tax. They thought it was \"too much money,\" I guess, or it would make businesses too successful. They don't want to see success. They certainly don't want to see it before the election. They certainly don't want to see the kind of graphs and charts that you saw up there. They don't. Because they say they can't win. With that kind of success, they can't win. They have to get used to it.\nSteve [Steve A. Holland,Reuters]. Thank you.\nWell, we're giving $400. And we are in constant touch with Governors, also, who—they'll be making, perhaps, a contribution. They have options. They can do it, or they don't have to do it. I think most of them will do it.\nWe're also doing a payroll tax cut, which is a massive number. That's a very big number. And that's a number that's bigger than the—any of the numbers we talked about. And the beauty of that is that it really incentivizes companies, and—because it's both a company cut and a employee cut. So that much, really—very much incentivizes people to go back to work and work hard and the company to hire people back. And we've had some of the great economic minds saying that's the most important cut; that would be the best cut you could do.\nWe couldn't get the Democrats to even think about agreeing to it. It's not the Democrat way, I guess. Because it just seems that, whether it's Larry Kudlow, or any of your many friends, that's the one they wanted the most. Would you say, Larry?\nAnd so we're doing that. And that was never even really discussed, because that was taken off the table by the Democrats immediately.\nAnd this is every week. Every week, you get a check—or a month, or biweekly. This is a major amount of money that you're getting directly. So it's really—you know, it's a very big number. It's very substantial number. And this is—don't forget, this is in addition to the $400. And this is a big number.\nAnd now, at the end of the year, on the assumption that I win, I'm going to terminate the payroll tax, which is another thing that some of the great economists would like to see done. We'll be paying into Social Security through the general fund. And it works out very nicely.\nIf Biden would win, he wouldn't do that, because he's going to double and triple everybody's taxes. He's going to have to explain that one. And as you know, he's also going to quadruple regulations. He wants to put regulations on.\nOne of the reasons that we had the kind of numbers and big bounces that you've seen—I mean we closed it up. We saved millions of lives, and now we opened it, and we bounce right back where we were. It looks like we'll be bouncing right back where we were. But one of the reasons is because we cut so many horrible regulations.\nAnd Biden, with his new partner, Kamala, will—if you think—he's going to put it all back, but many times more. I mean, they want to increase regulations, and that's just going to drive companies out, and it's going to drive people out. It's going to drive them to other countries, and it's going to make us not competitive with other countries.\nPlease, OAN.\nAntifa Movement/Civil Unrest and Violence in U.S. Cities\nThey should. I think they're afraid to. It's—in my book, it's virtually a part of their campaign: Antifa. The Democrats act like, \"Gee, I don't know exactly what that is.\" Take a look at Portland. Take a look at any place you want to take a look at, and they're all over the place. They were here. We put on a 10-year prison sentence if you knocked down any statues, 2 months ago. And since then, we haven't seen much of them.\nWe had to send border security—and we sent actually Homeland and Border and different forms of Homeland to Portland, in order to—you know what we had to do. We had to save—they wanted to knock down a courthouse—a $500 million courthouse—they wanted to burn it down, knock it down. And they were easily able to defend. But the mayor and the Governor of the State, they didn't want to do that.\nAnd we actually sent our people there, and they did a great job. And they were—they did it easily. But in the meantime, they went to other parts of the city, and they're doing damage. And we're recommending to the Governor that they call in national security, call in the National Guard. We're willing to get—we would stop that problem in one hour.\nWe sent just defensive measures to protect and save that courthouse from being burned down or knocked down. We also saved a couple of other buildings—Federal buildings—because they were unable to do the job.\nI have to say this: They have really good police. They have a great group of people that, if they would be allowed to do their job—same with Chicago and same with New York and a couple of other cities—if they allowed—you have, in Chicago, 25,000 police, and they're really good, but they're not allowed to do their job.\nIn New York, you have New York's Finest, but they've totally taken away their incentive. They've taken away their lives, in a sense, because they don't allow them to do their job. They could do that job so easily; you wouldn't have a problem in New York. And that includes with terrorism and everything else. They disbanded—they've cut by $1 billion their budget in New York. One billion dollars. And crime is up by 200 percent, 250 percent, depends on what week you're looking at. It's crazy what's going on in New York.\nWe could solve that problem easily, but we don't have to, because they should be able to do it themselves. But they have to give the honor back. It's the—it's an honor. They have to give the honor back to their law enforcement groups. New York is great; so is Chicago. And in Portland, they could do the job. If they don't want to do that, we would send in—gladly, if they want—the National Guard will take care of it in 1 hour. It will go very quickly.\nAs we did—by the way, if you take a look in Minneapolis, when they were burning down Minneapolis—a wonderful place but nobody's ever seen anything like it. After days, the very liberal mayor—and these are all run by liberal Democrats. Every place I talk about is run—because we have great cities, and they're run by Republicans. Okay? It's—you know, it's—there's no magic to it. It's obvious, what's going on.\nAnd these—the cities that I mentioned are all run by liberal—very liberal—Democrats. And it's very sad when you see what's happening to New York. It's very sad when you see what's happening to other cities, not just those three, other cities. And when you look at what's happening, it's not even believable.\nI left New York almost 4 years ago. And you could see signs of problems, because de Blasio was there. He's a horrific mayor, just horrific. I mean, people don't want to go there anymore. He's—not only is it bad with crime, I mean, the way he talks about the city and what he does. He's horrific. And when I see that, it's a very sad thing. I left almost 4 years ago, right? And when I look and see what's happening to a city that I love—that still has great potential, but it's going to have to be brought back. Because what happened in New York is—it's not even believable.\nWhat's happening in Chicago, where one weekend you have 78 people shot and 18 die—in a weekend. And then, successive weekends, you have so much of that happening. And it's not even—it's really not even believable.\nAnd if you let Democrats run this country—and we've stopped it from going other places—if you let Democrats run this country, you'll have all of your cities be just like that.\nYes, please.\nWell, look, you just saw it. Other countries—we're doing much better than all other major countries, peer countries. This chart came out just a little while ago. I thought I'd say—see, it's that kind of a question—a wise-guy question—because I just went over the whole thing. We're doing better than almost everyone with the economy. And I think we're—you know, we face a headwind because Democrats, perhaps for political reasons, don't want to open up their States. And that's having a huge toll—that's taking a huge toll on people within those States.\nWhen you look at North Carolina, you have—a man doesn't want to open it up. You have—you look at Michigan, you look at some States—I mean, they just want to keep these people in their houses, in their prisons. They call them \"prisons.\" And I think a lot of it is for political reasons, because they want to look as bad as possible on November 3. But I don't think it's going to matter because we're doing so well in so many ways.\nAs far as the plague is concerned, when you look at the numbers, take a look at what's going on now with other countries, they're having flare-ups that are very, very substantial, and we've done very well. We're helping a lot of those countries. And those were model countries that you used to talk about and say how well they were doing, except they just exploded. They just had very big flare-ups. You understand that. No, we're doing very well. And I don't have to show you the charts again, but those charts are at a level that nobody even thought possible.\nI think we're going to have a fantastic third quarter. I think next year will be one of the strongest years we've had. And this is with California being closed down. This is where North Carolina and Michigan and tremendous States—great States—are being closed by—for reasons, I think, that would—that Scott would tell you—you would disagree with, right? You disagree with. He—we spent a great amount of time talking about it.\nWe've got to open up our country. We understand the disease. We understand who it hits. We have to protect our elderly people, especially our elderly people that are not well. We have to protect them. But we understand it, and we understand it well. We've learned a lot.\nAnd we're going to have the vaccine soon, and we're going to have the therapeutic soon. Going to come out very soon, and we're very proud of the people and the job they've done.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\n2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., and Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris\nI didn't watch. I saw just a moment of him speaking, a moment of her speaking, and it was enough.\nLook, he made a choice: He picked her. I watched her. I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing. And she left angry. She left mad. There was nobody more insulting to Biden than she was. She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman where she, I guess, believed the woman. And now all of a sudden, she's running to be Vice President, saying how wonderful he is.\nI thought it was a very unusual pick, because she said such bad things. And you know better than anybody what—you know, you won't write it because, you know, you don't want to do that—but you know better than anybody. She said horrible things about him. Horrible things. And she mocked him, openly mocked him. That's why I thought that was a very risky pick, because I'm sure that'll be played back—not necessarily by me, but others—it will be played back.\nThe other thing, if you look, she wants a $3 trillion tax hike. No fracking. How do you think \"no fracking\" in Pennsylvania is going to play? That's a big fracking State. If you didn't have energy produced that way, you would have taxes that would triple, and you'd have unemployment that you wouldn't believe.\nAnd Pennsylvania, last year, had the best year they've ever had. Texas, last year, had the best year they've ever had. Oklahoma, best year. Almost every State in our Nation, last year, had the best year they've ever had. And they're going to have that again next year. And you can see that by what—but think of it: She wants no fossil fuels. No fossil fuels. Really? Tell that to Texas.\nAnd then, I hear, \"Trump is only one point up in Texas.\" No, they said the same thing with Crooked Hillary Clinton. They said: \"Texas is in play. Trump is down in Texas.\" And then, I won Texas. Immediately, when they said the polls are closed, \"Trump has won Texas.\" And I won by a lot. And I won Georgia by a lot. It's the same thing over—it's almost like a duplication of what happened before, except we have much more energy now than we ever did in 2016, and we had a lot. We had record amounts in 2016.\nBut you take a look at the tax cuts. We gave the biggest tax cut in the history of our country and the biggest regulation cuts in the history of our country, by far. Right? He wants to increase everybody's taxes. And she's one of the people that wants that.\nI mean, you take a look at that. She wants to defund or at least substantially reduce money going to police departments. And you can't do that. You can't do that. It's actually got to be the opposite. I've been endorsed by so many police departments. I'm getting a really good one this week that you'll be seeing, really big, really good.\nBut who could ever—what police department, what law enforcement group could ever support Joe Biden, where he said things that are so bad and so foolish—frankly, so stupid—in terms of crime and what would happen. So we're getting all of law enforcement.\nWe're getting the military. She wants to spend much less on our military. I've rebuilt the military. We have the strongest military now. Much of the equipment is coming in, all made in the United States; $2.5 trillion, we spent.\nWhen I took over we had a military that was totally—it was in terrible, terrible shape. It was depleted. It was a depleted military: old planes, old tanks, old everything. And we have a beautiful, brandnew military with the best people in the world. We never had anything like it. Some of the equipment is still coming in.\nNo, we have—we've done a real job. And I think we're going to be extremely successful. I was surprised that he picked her—very surprised—because of the horrible way she talked about him. And frankly, because she dropped like a rock.\nI didn't when I ran. I ran against 17 people, mostly Governors and Senators, some others. Ben Carson was very strong, very good. A couple of others, but mostly Governors, mostly Senators. And I ran, and I went up.\nShe ran, and she went down to rock bottom. I don't think she ever got to run her first—to take a vote in her first—in the first State. And so, generally speaking, you don't want to pick somebody that went down, and she went down. But she went down in a very terrible way, and she said horrible things about Biden.\nShe said far worse about Biden than I ever did. And now she's running as Vice President. So how does that work?\nPlease, in the back.\nIt's such a fair question, such a good question. Yes, I mean, you hear what I was saying and what—Scott will be involved, and he'll be talking to you over the next couple of days—what he's saying from great experience. No, I feel very badly for them. And I have a feeling that on November 4, somebody is going to announce: \"Schools are open. The country is open. Everything is open.\" I really believe a lot of it is done for political reasons, if you want to know the truth. I think so.\nBut you're right; online is not the same as being in the classroom. And that's been proven. It's been proven loud and clear.\nGo ahead. Go ahead, please. Please.\nYes.\nWhat I mean is, people are going to become—they are going to be opening up areas of your neighborhood—which they're doing, and now they're going to do—they wanted to expand it. And they will expand it. If, for any reason—they're going to, in my opinion, destroy suburbia.\nAnd just so you understand, 30 percent-plus of the people living in suburbia are minorities. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American—they're minorities. Thirty percent. The number is even higher, it's—they say 35, but I like to cut it a little bit lower. You know why? That way I can never get myself in too much trouble with the fake news. But 30 percent-plus are minorities living in suburbia.\nAnd when they go in and they want to change zoning so that you have lots of problems, where they want to build low-income housing—you want something where people can aspire to be there, not something where it gets hurt badly. And that's what happens.\nSo, with suburban women, suburban men, I think they feel very strongly about what I'm doing. It's a very—I mean, it's a very fair question. It's a very important question. But they fought all their lives to be there, and then all of a sudden, they have—something happened that changes their life and changes what they fought for, for so many years.\nJohn [John Roberts,Fox News], please.\nSo we're looking at Gettysburg.\nA magnificent site. I've been there a number of times. Just a magnificent site. And we're looking at the White House. And I would say it's really down to those two.\nThe White House would be a much easier, from the standpoint of Secret Service and, you know, the movement of hundreds of people, as you know.Q.Which way are you leaning?\nI would say we love them both. I love Gettysburg, but it's—this is simpler. It would be magnificent. The White House is a—the White House is the White House. Gettysburg is one of the great and historic sites of our country—frankly, as far as I'm concerned, of the world. So one of those two. I'll probably be announcing it over the next week or so, maybe less.\nWe're taking it out of the general fund. And what we'll do——\nYes, what we'll be doing is, if we do that, we'll get it approved, in that case, by Congress. And we'll take the money from other places, other than—we will not take it from Social Security in——\n——any way shape or form.\nYou're right, but we're going to have tremendous growth. We have tremendous growth. You take a look at what's happening here.\nNext year—unless somebody comes in who doesn't know what they're doing and they start raising taxes and forcing everybody to leave the country or leave their jobs and companies to close—we will have tremendous growth. You will see growth like you haven't seen in a long time.\nYes, please.\n2020 Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Senator Kamala D. Harris/Federal Coronavirus Response/Coronavirus Testing Access and Technology\nSure.\nI think that's probably one of the reasons she was a terrible candidate and was forced to leave the race, because she got her facts wrong. You know she's very bad on facts. She is very weak on facts.\nAnd, just so you understand: We've done more testing than any country in the world, by far. That includes India, which has 1.5 billion people. That includes China. That includes every country in the world. We've done more testing. We have better testing than any country in the world. They call; they want to know: \"Where do we get it? How do we get it?\" We have better testing than any country in the world.\nWhen you do as much testing as us, however, as you understand, you develop more cases. If you tested instead of 65 million people, which is what we've done—when you test that many people—you're going to find cases that normally you wouldn't see.\nIf you go to Mexico and you go to other countries, you'll see they do almost no testing. They test if somebody is not feeling well. They test if somebody is symptomatic. They test very little. They test very little.\nWe've done more testing than anybody in the world. We've done the best job of any country in the world, and that includes from making ventilators that nobody else could have done. We are the ventilator king of the world. We're supplying the whole world now, in a few short months, with ventilators that are very hard to produce, very expensive, very complex, very delicate, very, very important. We've done a great job.\nAnd then, on top of that, when you look at the numbers—how we were impacted less than these other countries. And now, you look at the explosion of countries that you would have said \"did such a good job,\" and some of them had advantages over us for obvious reasons, having to do with the pandemic. But when you look at the job that we've done compared to others, we've done a great job.\nAnd she—I read today that she's very short on facts. She—I think she's going to be a big failure. And I think—I look forward to the debate between her and Mike Pence, because I think he'll do even better against her than he did about—against Senator Kaine, which was a total wipeout. So we'll see how it all works out.\nAll right, one more.\nYes, please, in the back.\nGo ahead.\nYou in the back, please.\nYes. I say the Democrats are sabotaging the Post Office because they're not approving $25 billion that was requested. So they're sabotaging the Post Office, and they're not allowing the Post Office to function properly, and they're certainly not allowing universal mail-in votes if—when they do that.\nBut equally importantly, they're not allowing $3.5 billion in funds to do voting that they'd like to do. Therefore all of this—and all of the tremendous mistakes that were made with regard to mail-in voting—all of these tremendous mistakes, you can't even—you can't even do it. I would imagine the courts—you know, this is in many courts right now. They're showing all of the disasters that have taken place just in the last short period of time—in the last 2 months—with respect to universal mail-in voting. It's just, like, a total catastrophe what's happening. And we can't let that happen.\nGo ahead, real fast. Go ahead.\nRight.\nYes. Well, it's going up by cases. If you look at cases. And the cases are going up because we do so much testing and we find it. And I call it \"fake-media gold\" because we do so much more testing than any other country. And when you do all that testing, you find cases.\nGo ahead, Steve. Real fast. Go ahead.\nChina-U.S. Trade/Coronavirus Outbreak in China\nWe've taken a lot of money from China on the last year and a half that no other President has taken in. We've done things to China that nobody else has done to China, or even thought of doing—with 25-percent tariffs and taking in billions and billions of dollars—tens of billions of dollars. And giving them—giving the farmers, as an example, $12 billion one year, $16 billion another year—and made the farmers extremely happy. You don't hear them complaining. They were targeted by China.\nBut I'm very angry at China because they let this horrible disease—they let this horrible plague come into our country and come into the world. And they should have been able to stop it. They stopped it from going into China. They should have been able to stop it. So I'm very angry at China.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1251"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-13", "Text": "Hello, everyone. Thank you very much. It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they've caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro—horribly shot—a young man, wonderful young man. And we have just—this just came out 2 minutes ago. So Attorney General Barr just announced.\nAs you know, we named Operation LeGend after LeGend Taliferro, where we're going to be helping out, and are in the process of helping out, cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime, in particular, certain types of crime. So that's really good news. They caught the killer of LeGend.\nToday we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people. That's what it is. At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence and putting left-wing politics before facts and evidence.\nSleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans. You know that. He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early. If he had followed—if we went after—I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would have died. This is according to many people. I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that. He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.\nJoe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every U.S. community based on his policies. He wants to have ridiculous open borders. I've been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that, you have open borders, you don't have a country. You don't have a country, with open borders. So he wants open borders. The Democrats want open borders.\nAnd if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through. The wall is getting close to 290 miles long, and it's having a huge impact. So we disagree with him on that. That's one of the many different—many things that we disagree with.\nBut while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the Federal Government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law-abiding citizens.\nHe wants the President of the United States, with the mere stroke of a pen, to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of 3 straight months—I guess this just happened; he thinks it's good politics, I guess—no matter where they live and no matter their surroundings. Because different States are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem.\nHe does not identify what authority the President has to issue such a mandate or how Federal law enforcement could possibly enforce it or why we would be stepping on Governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job, and they know what is needed.\nAlso, many of our 50 States are doing the job at a level that frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice. So I want to just say our Governors have worked very hard. They've worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that's been going. We have Scott now involved. And so, Scott, congratulations. You'll be working with a lot of Governors; you've already started. And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx.\nIf the President has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have? That's why he refused—Biden—to take questions. He couldn't answer any of them. Couldn't answer the questions. He refuses to take questions. He never takes questions. I take questions; he never takes questions. And you sort of wonder what's going on, because they're not that difficult. Some can be nasty, but they're not that difficult. But he never takes questions. So he just, I guess, left. I didn't see it, but I guess he just left the podium. Put it in your minds.\nMy administration has a different approach: We have urged Americans to wear masks. And I emphasized, this is a patriotic thing to do. Maybe they're great, and maybe they're just good. Maybe they're not so good. But frankly, what do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose. So we do, and we've been saying wear them when it's appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing, if you can't distance enough. And what do you have to lose?\nBut again, it's up to the Governors. And we want to have a certain freedom. And we want to have a certain freedom. That's what we're about. At the same time, we also understand that each State is different and is facing unique circumstances. You have very, very different States facing very unique differences and circumstances.\nWe've entrusted the Governors of each State, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies, following guidance from the Federal Government and CDC. We're working with each State to implement a plan based on the facts and science. We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the Federal Government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal.\nAmericans must have their freedoms. And I trust the American people and their Governors very much. I trust the American people. And the Governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions, and Joe doesn't. Joe doesn't. Joe doesn't know too much.\nUnlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science. That's why we're focused on protecting the high-risk Americans. That is why we're delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate. And that is why we're developing a vaccine and therapeutics in record time. You'll see that, I think, very soon.\nSleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to. I think I can speak for you. We've been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks. But he wants them in the basement for months on end.\nAnd you have Governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their—wherever they may be—apartments. And frankly, I don't think the results are necessarily better than other results. But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools, and grind society to a halt. And he wants it done by a Federal decree. This would lead to a crippling, long-lasting depression. This would be a crippling, long-lasting depression.\nAnd yesterday I showed you the numbers about how well we're doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed. And we're back and very strong. It's a very strong \"V.\" It's almost a straight-up \"V.\" We'll be discussing that over the next couple of days.\nBut the economy is coming back, and the employment numbers over the last 3 months are a record in history of our country. And we'll be back next year. I think we'll be maybe even stronger than the previous years, where we set every record in the book: unemployment and stock market.\nBy the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record. And NASDAQ is actually a record over the last 14 days. Fourteen—for 14 times now, it's been record. And that's during what we hope will be the more final stages of the pandemic.\nSo if we did what Biden wanted to do, it would shut down our health care system and lead to a massive increase in mortality, including suicide, overdose, heart disease, and countless other physical and mental harms. It is very, very bad on the other side of the equation, when you do something like that. Those shutdowns are very punitive. Very punitive. They hurt a lot of people in a lot of different ways through depression, through suicide, through so many other things: alcohol, drugs.\nBiden's approach is regressive, it's antiscientific, and it's very defeatist. It would be very bad for our country. While Joe Biden has been playing politics from the sidelines—he has no clue—we've been solving problems and delivering tremendous results; the most advanced and robust testing system on the planet; the number-one producer of ventilators in the world, by far; unprecedented industrial mobilization—biggest since World War II—Operation Warp Speed to deliver lifesaving treatments and, very soon, a vaccine.\nWhat a plan by Joe Biden has actually laid out would do, we've really, already, accomplished. In fact, many of the things that was well reported over the last few days—every single thing he said to do, every single thing we did, and we did them well. So Biden has no idea on his own. He only knows what he thinks we should do, and he spews it out, and then he—I guess you could say he \"plagiarizes,\" and he really did in our case, because every single one of the events—I think, Kayleigh, we can say that—was something we had already done.\nSo we'll defeat the virus, but not by hiding in our basements. He's got to come out of his basement. We'll defeat this virus through a commonsense mitigation effort, shielding those at highest risk, and unleashing America's medical and scientific genius, which is what it is. And we've already been doing it, and we're very close to having something that's going to be very, very special in the form of therapeutics and vaccines.\nTo Joe, I would say: Stop playing politics with a virus. Too serious. Partisan politics has no place here. It's a shameful situation for anybody to try and score political points while we're working to save lives and defeat the pandemic.\nIn times of national challenge, America has—and Americans—and we are—by the way, we are working with countries from all over the world, and they're trying to learn from us. And some of the countries that you spoke most well about are having a tremendous surge right now. But it will work out. But Americans must unite together, and they must put politics aside and have to really unite for a common good.\nThree vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. They're doing really well. We're producing the most promising vaccine candidates in advance, as you know, part of the largest industrialization ever. It's incredible, when I meet with heads of companies that are doing this—that are the best companies anywhere in the world—it's incredible where they are, how they're doing, and the speed with which they're doing it, and also the speed with which the FDA is approving things, because by any other standard, you would have been 2 or 3 years away from being at the point that we're at.\nBy the end of this week, we will have shipped 1,846 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes, which are a very important source, as you know, for people that are not handling the plague from China very well. This week alone, we're sending 992 testing devices and 450,000 tests to more than 950 nursing homes across the country. And these tests are incredible. These are tests that are all new, very modern.\nAnd we're also getting on—the tests that are not done immediately, with the 5- to 15-minute timing, when they do send them to a lab, they're coming back now in 3 days. So it's a 3-day process, which is about as good as you can do. You have 1 day of delivering, 1 day of receiving, and 1 day in the lab. We're also requiring all nursing homes to test all members of their staff at least weekly.\nBy unleashing America's scientific genius, we have delivered effective treatments. The case fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by about 85 percent. That's a fantastic number. It's declined. That's case fatality. It's declined by 85 percent.\nEurope has seen 40-percent more excess mortality than the United States compared to a nonpandemic year. So you hear the numbers, and those numbers are very interesting, but that's the way it is.\nWe continue to urge all Americans to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when necessary and when you cannot distance, and protect—very importantly—the vulnerable. Protect people that are older and especially people that have problems with heart or diabetes or some other problem.\nEarlier today very exciting news—very big news all over the world; they're talking about it all over the world; it was amazing—we finalized a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. After half a century, Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations. Nobody thought this was something that could happen for a long time. This is the most important diplomatic breakthrough since the Egypt-Israel peace agreement; it was signed over 40 years ago.\nWe have Ambassador to Israel David Friedman here. Thank you, David, for being here. We very much—you would agree that this was a big day for Israel and a big day for the world?\nGood. Thank you, David. You've been fantastic too. Fantastic Ambassador and representative of our country. Thank you very much.\nThe deal that was reached today will enable Muslims to have far greater ability to visit many historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is very important to them, which they've wanted to have access to for many, many decades.\nThis is a monumental step to forging ties of cooperation in the Middle East. And I think you're going to have other countries come forward. I can tell you we already do, and they want to make a deal. They're going to have peace in the Middle East. It will be fantastic.\nIsrael is also suspending settlements in the West Bank, which is a big deal, a bold step toward achieving peace. Israel and the United Arab Emirates have also agreed to immediately expand and accelerate scientific collaboration to develop effective treatments and vaccines to defeat the China virus—they've both been hit; virtually, every country has been hit, 188 countries—and to save lives in their region and in their world. So they are working very much on the vaccines, also with us. And, again, some very good news is going to take place with respect to that.\nOur unprecedented diplomatic engagements laid the groundwork for this historic peace agreement, which was just announced a little while ago, today.\nWe will not rest as we continue to work toward a world of greater harmony and prosperity for all. I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates—two fantastic people—for their vision and their leadership. And I look forward to hosting them at the White House very soon to formally sign the agreement. We'll probably be doing it over the next, I would say, 3 weeks. And they'll be coming to Washington.\nSo that was a tremendous day. That was a tremendous thing that happened. And it's a great sign. We have a lot of other interesting things going on with other nations, also having to do with peace agreements. And a lot of big news is coming over the next few weeks, and I'm sure you'll be very impressed. And more importantly, it's a great thing for our country, a great thing for the world. So thank you very much.\nPlease, go ahead.\nWell, you know we don't want the schools shut down. We want the schools to open. And especially very young children handle it—children, all children—but especially very young children handle it very well. So we want schools open. We don't want to be in that position. We want schools open. We've made payment. And we would, frankly, if the school isn't going to open, we would much rather follow the child with the payment——\n——give the money to the child, meaning the parents of the child, and let that—let the parents do what they have to do, including bringing the child to another school, because we're finding that whether it's parents or children, people want to get back to school. They want to have their life back.\nSome people say they don't want—the Democrats don't want schools open, because that's where you have a lot of polling booths. And if you have a school closed, you can't very easily have polling booths at the school. And that's becoming—I think maybe we'll be able to show that as fact, but that's another thing that they're doing to try and keep people away from the polls. So we have to look into that, but it's—you've been reading about it, I've been reading about it, and I don't like it.\nBut we'd like to see the schools open. Then, we don't have that problem.\nGood question.\nThank you. Please, Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters].\nWhat do you think? Tell me.\nWell, but they are supported largely by some of the countries that we're talking to and that have already signed—you know, in the case of the one country. But others will be following. And I think the Palestinians will—without saying it necessarily yet, I think they very much want to be a part of what we're doing. And I see, ultimately, the Palestinians—I see peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I see that happening. I think as these very big, powerful, wealthy countries come in, I think the Palestinians will follow, quite naturally.\nYes, please.\nSay it again. Could you make it louder?\nWhat do you think about that, David? It's interesting.\nOkay? Please, Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN].\nNo, not at all. No.\nSure. A separate thing, I would do it. But one of the reasons the Post Office needs that much money is they have all of these millions of ballots coming in from nowhere, and nobody knows from where and where they're going. You saw what happened in—Kaitlan—in Virginia. It was, you know, 500,000 applications coming in, going all over the State; nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. It was a basic disaster. And you see Paterson, New Jersey, what's going on there. And we can give you many other locations and sites.\nWhat has happened is that's part of a big negotiation. That's a—actually small part of a big negotiation to get more money to people that it wasn't their fault; it was China's fault. And Post Office is part of it. Another part of it is, they want $3½ billion just for the ballots themselves. Why it's so much, I don't know. But that's what the Democrats want. But if the bill isn't going to get done, that would mean the Post Office isn't going to get funded, and that would also mean that the $3½ billion dollars isn't going to be taken care of. So I don't know how you can possibly use these ballots, these mail-in ballots.\nAbsentee ballots, by the way, are fine. But the universal mail-ins that are just sent all over the place, where people can grab them and grab stacks of them and sign them and do whatever you want, that's the thing we're against.\nI can understand the Post Office. And if we could agree to a bill—the overall bill, which is obviously a much bigger number than just the Post Office—that would be fine. But they have the Post Office as one of their requests. It's their request.\nI'm only against—what I'm against is, I'm against doing anything where the people aren't taken care of, and the people aren't being taken care of properly. We have—we want people to get money. It wasn't their fault that they got shut down. They got shut down by China.\nSo whether it's the Post Office or whether it's the $3½ billion dollars—you know, they're asking for $3½ billion dollars just for the universal mail-in ballots, but they're not willing to make a deal. These are two points within a very big deal.\nThe thing they want more than anything else, Kaitlan—and you know this—is bailout money for the States and for the cities that are in trouble, which, for the most part, are Democrat-run States and cities. So New York has a problem, California has a problem, Illinois has a tremendous problem, and others. They want to be able to bail out these States, and we don't want to be doing that or certainly don't want to do it to the extent. They're looking for $1 trillion; we don't want to be doing that.\nPlease go ahead.\nNo, no. No, no. I said it will end up being fraudulent, because if you look at what's happened over the last few weeks—just look at the few instances where this has happened—it's turned out to be fraudulent.\nWell, if you look at New York, it was fraudulent; if you look at Paterson, New Jersey, it was fraudulent.\nOf course, there is. The whole thing is a mess. In fact, Carolyn Maloney's opponent is—he's gone crazed. He said they took the election away from him, and he may be right. I think they should redo that election. And if you look at Virginia, it's terrible. Look at some of the things that have happened in California. Look at California, where they found a million noneligible voters. That was done by Judicial Watch—Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch.\nWe have to have an honest election. And if it's not going to be an honest election, I guess people have to sit down and think really long and hard about it. But if the Post Office——\n——if they're not going to approve a bill and the Post Office, therefore, won't have the money, and if they're not going to approve a big bill, a bigger bill, and they're not going to have the $3½ billion dollars for the universal mail-in votes, how can you have those votes?\nWhat it would mean is, the people will have to go to the polls and vote, like the old days—like 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago. They have to go to the—it doesn't say anybody is taking the vote away, but it means that the universal mail-ins don't work. Absentees do work. It's a very different thing—an absentee—where you make an application, and you send it in, they send you a vote. It's different.\nBut—so, Kaitlan, I'm not saying anything wrong with voting. I want them to vote. But that would mean that they'd have to go to a voting booth, like they used to, and vote.\nWell, they're going to have to feel safe, and they will be safe, and we will make sure that they're safe. And we're not going to have to spend $3½ billion dollars to do it.\nAnd when you go to a voting—it would be wonderful if we had voting ID. And some States have that, and some States don't because they can't get it passed. Most States want it. But we want people to vote. We want people to vote so when they vote, it means one vote; it doesn't mean ballots all over the place.\nYou saw what would—what was happening in Virginia, where piles of ballot applications are dropped all over the State. They had them named after dogs. They had them named after dead people. We want to have an accurate vote. I'm not doing this for any reason. Maybe the other turns out to be my advantage, I don't know. I can't tell you that.\nBut I do know this: I just want an accurate vote—and it's a fair question, by the way—and so does everybody else.\nYes, in the back.\nHelp what?\nWell, I think it's going to. I think it's a big start. And you're right about that: Christians have been persecuted by some countries in particular in the Middle East. And I think this is a big start. It's going to be a very strong start, very powerful start, and it's something that I will tell you—I've told David, and I've told every one of our negotiators: If you look at the way Christians have been treated in some countries, it's beyond disgraceful. It's—if I had information and if I had absolute proof—some of the stories that we've heard, which are not easy, which is not easy to get—I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn't believe. What they do to Christians in the Middle East—and it's disgraceful. It's disgraceful. You're right.\nIt's a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in—for instance, U.A.E. has agreed very strongly to represent us; I think they will very well with respect to Christianity, because in the Middle East, it's not treated well. It's not treated well at all. It's treated horribly and very unfairly, and it's criminal what's happened, and that's for many, many years.\nI think it's a great question and very—it's a very unfair situation.\nPlease, go ahead.\nTikTok/China-U.S. Trade\nNo, we have a deadline of September 15. And whether it's Microsoft, I understand—and others are negotiating—we also said that, obviously, it's worthless if we don't allow them into the country, so we said that the United States Treasury is going to be getting something out of this deal—something very substantial.\nBut what we want is total security, but we have a deadline of September 15. So I know Microsoft and others are very interested in it, but that's our deadline. And it has to be proven to be totally secure. We don't want to have any information going into China with what we've been through.\nAnd I have to tell you—you talk about the deal—you mentioned the phase one deal. Well, the phase one deal, it's a very interesting situation because you've been hearing, \"the largest order of corn in history,\" \"the largest order of soybeans,\" \"the largest order of beef.\" They've done more than they've ever done.\nSo you're going to have to figure that one out. With where I'm coming from, I could have—because they see my attitude. My attitude toward China is not friendly. But they have gone into orders that are extremely large, extremely large, and our farmers are very happy.\nBut with what they did with respect to the pandemic, the plague that came in from China, it just is a different feeling. It's an incredible deal, but I have a very different feeling.\nBut they are giving—they are giving the Midwest, our farmers, among the largest orders they've ever seen. Somebody told me today—Bob Lighthizer said about 40 percent of the—of what they're selling now is going to China. So maybe they're trying to make me change my mind a little bit, because you know my attitude on China, and it's not—it hasn't been very good.\nWell, we're not talking to them. No, we're talking to the companies. In theory, it's a company, but it's a company within China. That means China. And the deal will have to be substantially beneficial to the United States, and we need total security. Okay?\nGo ahead, please.Israel's Proposed Annexation of West Bank Territories\nWell, not off the table. No. It's something they've discussed, but Israel has agreed not to do that. I mean, more than just off the table, they have agreed not to do it. And I think that was very important, and I think it was a great concession by Israel, and I think it was a very smart concession by Israel.\nBut, David, do you have anything further to add on that?\nNo, right now all I can say: It's off the table. So I can't talk about some time into the future; that's a big statement. But right now it's off the table. Is that a correct statement, Mr. Ambassador?\nGo ahead.\nThat's right.\nNo, not at all.\nNo, I wouldn't do that at all. No, I want the Post Office to run properly. But—which makes sense, they would need a lot more money if they're going to be taking in tens of millions of ballots that just come out of the sky from nowhere. And so they need additional financial help.\nIt's a part of the bill that the Democrats don't want to make, because they want a trillion—much bigger part of the bill—they want a trillion dollars to go to States that are run by Governors, who happen to be Democrats, who have not done a good job for many, many years. And those are States that owe a lot of money and need a lot of money, and they're talking about $1 trillion.\nSo the Post Office and the $3½ billion dollars for the votes themselves, which sounds like a lot of money they're looking for—$3½ billion dollars. Think of that: $3½ billion to have mail-in ballots.\nAgain, absentee, good; universal mail-in, very bad.\nJust 1 second. Please, go ahead.\nThat do what?\nSo, everyone talks about \"Russia, Russia, Russia.\" They talk about \"China, China.\" They talk about all of these different countries that come in and run our elections, which is false.\nBut what they do—what they don't talk about are things like very loose mail-in ballots, universal in nature, that, frankly, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran—all of these countries that we are reading about, hearing about, and, in some cases, they're writing about, intelligence-wise—these countries can grab those ballots or print forgeries of those ballots, and they would go out, and they would have a field day.\nThis is the easiest way for—the mail-in ballots is the easiest way for a country like a China or Russia or a North Korea or Iran—I hear Iran too. You know, that was part of the report. This would be very easy for them. This is much easier than——\nWell, we have been very strong. Now, if you remember, President Obama was informed about Russia by the FBI in September. The election was in November. President Obama decided to do absolutely nothing about it. People don't mention that very much anymore. That's a lost fact. But he was informed very powerfully that they're going to do—and President Obama did nothing. We have done a lot, and we've really shored it up.\nBut what people can never prepare for are millions and millions of mail-in ballots. Because they can be forged. They can be captured. They can be taken.\nNo, that's a very hard thing to do. We have to make sure that we can do that.\nAll the what?\nThat who has done?\nYes, go ahead. Please. Please.\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead.\nThe payroll tax is very important and a very big benefit to people; as you know, to companies, because we want the companies to be strong—but now, directly to people. And it's a very big number. And we're taking care of it. And we—this will go directly to the people, to workers within the company. It's a payroll tax. It's called a payroll tax cut. We're cutting the payroll tax. And it's a very large number, and that will go directly to the workers of the company.\nThe—you mean later on? You mean later on, at a later date?\nThe employers—the employers will collect it and give it, most likely. The employers will collect it and give it. Okay?\nPlease, go ahead.\nCan't—can't understand a word you're saying.\nSo I just heard that. I heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements. And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that's right. I would have—I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for Vice President.\nBut that's a very serious—you're saying that—they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country?\nYes, I don't know about it. I just heard about it. I'll take a look.\nBack in the back, please.\nYes, I'm thinking about going directly to the U.N. to do the speech. A lot of people will not, because of COVID—will not be able to be there, as you know. But I'm thinking—I think it's appropriate. If we can do it, I'll do it directly. And again, this will not be like in the past, because some countries won't be able to escape the problems they're having. You know, countries are having a tremendous problem with the China virus. So we'll see what happens.\nBut I would prefer doing it. I can do it the other way. I can do it \"viral,\" as they say. I can do it in that form. But I'd rather be at the United Nations—deliver it.\nI think it—I think it better represents the country. Also, I feel, sort of, a—at least a semiobligation as the President of the United States to be at the United Nations to deliver what will be an important speech.\nWell, the room won't be empty. The room will have different people there and representatives of countries. But I can understand how it's, you know—it's very difficult for countries to be there. They won't be there only for that reason. They'd love to be there. I've already had people call. In fact, say—a couple of them—\"I'd love to be there. If you want, I'll be there.\" I said, \"Don't be there. You don't have to be there.\"\nNo, the room would be—I think the room will not be—although, there may be a spacing requirement like you have in this room. This room was always packed. This room would be packed again if we had the seats open. But you have a spacing requirement, so I understand that the United Nations, they may have that too.\nYes, please.\nSure. Yes. Please.\nWell, I think it's a terrible thing. But one thing that we have done—you know, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives, and it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States with respect to that. It just won't be, because we've taken all of the incentives away.\nIf you look at China—with the World Trade Organization, as an example—they're getting tremendous, because they're considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation, but we're not? And they get tremendous incentives.\nWe have—by the way, I told them it's unacceptable, and we've been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.\nWe've now withdrawn all of those incentives. It's going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States—and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it—will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We've withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong, because freedom is a great thing.\nThank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1255"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-14", "Text": "Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. So we have some very interesting news. Kevin Clinesmith, a corrupt FBI attorney who falsified FISA warrants in James Comey's very corrupt FBI, is expected to plead guilty. You probably heard that. It just came out. So that's just the beginning, I would imagine, because what happened should never happen again. So he is pleading guilty. Terrible thing. Terrible thing. The fact is, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. And you'll be hearing more.\nToday the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy released a new report on how my administration has harnessed the full power of the Defense Production Act to achieve the greatest industrial mobilization since World War II, in our fight against the China virus.\nNew factories, businesses, and laboratories are being built all over America to match our Nation's demand for personal protective equipment, pharmaceuticals, drugs, testing supplies, therapeutics, and vaccines. It's been incredible what we've been able to do in a very short period of time. We're helping other countries also, because we've been really—we've been doing it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\nIt was just announced, a little while ago, industrial production rose for the third straight month. It's a big thing. Factory output was up 3.4 percent this month after a 5.7 increase last month. Those are getting to be record numbers. And manufacturing capacity utilization is now up to almost 70 percent. So we're coming back very strong. We should have a very good third quarter. We should have an unbelievably good next year. Next year, if we don't mess it up with somebody that has no idea what they're doing, it could be a fantastic year.\nMy administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act to a number—and a—related authorities—at a—78 times, dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials. So, put it a little bit differently: The administration has exercised the authority under the Defense Production Act and related authorities 78 times. That's a lot, Peter, right? It's a big number: 78 times. It came in very handy. A lot of times, we just mentioned it, and they did what we asked them to do. Dispersing over $3.5 billion to speed the development and manufacturing of essential materials.\nI've used the DPA more comprehensively than any President in history. There was a time when the media would say: \"Why aren't you using it? Why aren't you using it?\" Well, we have used it a lot, where necessary. Only where necessary. For the most part, we've had tremendous cooperation.\nBy invoking the DPA, we mobilized the extraordinary productive might of General Motors to manufacture ventilators. GM repurposed the Kokomo, Indiana, plant in just 17 days—an alltime record—and has now produced over 21,000 ventilators.\nWe're also working with Ford Motor Company and General Electric to produce over 30,000 ventilators a month in Michigan. They've done a great job. Our Nation is now the king of ventilators. I say that: the king of ventilators. We're sending them all over the world and helping a lot of countries that could never have ventilators. And it's—really, I guess we're looking to produce over 200,000 ventilators by the end of the year. Those are some numbers. So we're helping a lot of countries. In April, I directed 3M to increase its manufacturing of N95 masks. By May, they had increased production by over a million masks a day. Think of that: They increased production of masks by over 1 million a day. 3M is now manufacturing an additional 39 million masks a month. We also worked with Honeywell to open factories in Arizona and Rhode Island. They're now producing over 20 million masks a month.\nBy the end of the year, domestic U.S. manufacturing will have produced over 1 billion N95 respirators, and all of them are made right here in the U.S.A. That's a big difference from the past. Overall, we've increased N95 mask production by 400 million masks a year. Now, the media might say: \"Why not 500? Why not 600?\" Nobody has seen numbers like this ever.\nWe delivered more than $75 million in support to Puritan Medical in Maine. I was up there. I was—as you remember, we had a tremendous visit and tremendous throngs of people along the roads on the way to Puritan Medical. Puritan has doubled their production of testing swabs from 20 million to 40 million per month. They're doing a fantastic job, and so is Maine.\nI've also used the DPA to fight price gouging and hoarding. My administration located and seized over a half a million pieces of hoarded personal protective equipment, including 299,000 pairs of medical-grade gloves, 192,000 N95 respirators, and 130,000 surgical masks. That's hoarding.\nMy administration's decisive actions have yielded truly incredible results. People have done an incredible job. We've replenished the Strategic National Stockpile that was very badly depleted when we took office and totally neglected in the last administration. Since the start of the pandemic, we have tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to over 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to over 15 million, and quadrupled the number of ventilators to 69,000.\nBy September, the Strategic National Stockpile inventory is on track to contain over 300,000—excuse me, 300 million N95 respirators and surgical masks, over 4.5 billion gloves, and over 190,000 ventilators. That's far more than we've done before. It's not even close.\nAs we talk about the economy, we continue to restore America's industrial might. We're bringing jobs to the U.S.A. We understand that the economic health is critical—very critical—to public health. We'll be discussing next week some of the outstanding numbers we have, compared to any other country. There is no country even close when you look at what we've done compared to them on the—from the standpoint of the economy and also during—even during the period of the China virus.\nIn the last 3 months, we've added an average of 100,000 jobs every single day. We've also added over 620,000 manufacturing jobs in the past 3 months. That's despite people saying, \"You can't do manufacturing jobs anymore.\" You'd \"need a magic wand,\" they said, but they were wrong. Weekly jobless claims just fell below 1 million for the first time in a long time.\nI'm pleased to announce that as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Federal Government will be partnering with McKesson Corporation—great company, which is a major medical supplier—to rapidly distribute a China-virus vaccine as soon as one is approved—fully approved. They're in stage three trials. We have many of them going along different passes. Also many different companies doing them, very, very incredible companies.\nWe currently have three candidates in phase three clinical trials and are on pace to have more than 100 million doses of a vaccine ready before the end of the year and 500 million doses very shortly thereafter. And we're ready, logistically, to distribute them. Our military is ready. We have a great general who's in charge. That's what he does, is he distributes things; usually, it's people and weapons, tanks, but in this case, it's a vaccine or a therapeutic, as it may be. We continue to actively monitor the virus, executing our strategy to protect the vulnerable and prevent hospital overcrowding. As of today, hospitalizations continue to be very stable, and we will be watching always very carefully. Remain vigilant.\nWe ask every citizen to practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask when distancing is not possible, and to protect the elderly. Always protect the elderly.\nSo now we'll take a few questions if you'd like. Let's see.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nYes.\nSure, if they give us what we want. And it's not what I want, it's what the American people want.\nSo in addition to—and I just—I think, John, as part of your answer, I can read this: But in addition to the Executive orders that we signed, which are going to be doing terrific things in terms of payroll tax cut, which is a lot of money coming to a lot of people very quickly, I've directed the Secretary of the Treasury to get ready and send direct payments—$3,400 for a family of four—to all Americans. Democrats are holding this up. I am ready to have the UST and SBA send additional PPP payments to small businesses that have been hurt by the China virus. Democrats are holding this up.\nSo we're talking about—those are two things directly involved and, really, victim of the China virus. We're ready to send; Democrats are holding up. I'm ready to send rental assistance payments to hard-working Americans that have been hurt by the China virus. All of these things are in a list. Democrats are holding this up.\nI'm ready to send $105 billion to the States to help open schools safely, with additional PPP—E. And Democrats are holding this up. So that's $105 billion to the States to help open schools safely, with additional PPE. Democrats are holding that up. Right?\nAnd I'm ready to send more money to States and local governments to save jobs of our great police, our firefighters, our first responders and teachers. It's all ready to go. Democrats are holding it up. So they're holding, John, all of that up.\nYes, if they would do it.\nYes, but they're not giving it to me, they're giving it to the American people. I mean, giving it——\nYes, I would—I would certainly do that. Sure, I would do that.\nI'm waiting for the Democrats to approve it. Okay?\nWell, she did very well in the election. She won by a lot. She was very popular. She comes from a great State. And she had a tremendous victory, so absolutely, I did congratulate her.\nGo ahead, please.\nGo ahead, please.\nHealth of the President's Brother Robert S. Trump/Russia/Iran\nYes. I have a wonderful brother. We've had a great relationship for a long time, for—from day one. It's a long time ago. And he's in the hospital right now, and hopefully, he'll be all right. But he's pretty—he's having a hard time.\nHe's terrific.\nI haven't been told of it yet. I heard there's something, but I haven't been told of it yet.\nPlease, go ahead.\nWe don't know much about it. We hope it works; we do. We hope it works. They cut off certain trials, and we just feel it's important to go through the process. We have numerous different vaccines that we think are going to work, but we want to go through a system of trials. We're very advanced. We're very—we'll be announcing something in the not-too-distant future, also with therapeutics, which I think are very, very important.\nYes, please.\nWeChat/China-U.S. Relations\nWhatever.\nI do what's good in terms of the security of our country.\nWe've been very badly let down by China. What's your next question?\nRight.\nYes. Not supposed to do that.\nWe'll be announcing. We have four tankers. They going to Houston, and they're there. We—they're not supposed to be doing that. Iran is not supposed to be doing that. And so we did—we seized the tankers, and we're moving them, and moved, to Houston.\nNo, I haven't been blunt. I said, \"She treated Joe Biden worse than anybody else.\" I watched those debates. They were very boring, but they were debates nevertheless. And I watched, you know, pretty good parts of them, and she treated Biden worse than anybody else, by far. There was nobody—including Pocahontas—nobody treated Biden so badly as Kamala.\nNone whatsoever.\nAs you—as you know, none whatsoever. No, not at all.\nBecause they want $1 trillion to go to their friends doing a bad job running certain cities and States that are doing very badly. You know, most of our country is running very well. Even in terms of crime, most of our country is setting records in terms of low. But when you look at Chicago, when you look at what's going on in Illinois and New York and other places, both economically and in other ways, it's horrible. It's horrible.\nLook at Oregon. Look what's going on in Oregon. They have—I don't think they have a clue. We could stop that—if they would request it, we would stop that problem in 1 hour, like we did in Minneapolis. We would stop it in 1 hour. It would be over. It's so easy to do.\nAll right, please, go ahead. In the back, please.\nIsrael-United Arab Emirates Relations/Democratic Presidential Candidate Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr./Iran\nI heard that. That was a beauty. That's right.\nWe announced the deal. And I appreciate even the New York Times gave it great coverage and editorials today. Wall Street Journal, Washington Post—everybody was saying great. And this is something we've been working very hard on.\nAnd I saw where Sleepy Joe tried to claim credit for it, and I'm trying to figure out how that one works. No, what he did is, they made a terrible deal with Iran. And the deal was a horror show, and I ended it. They gave them $150 billion for nothing. They gave them $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. They got nothing from that deal except trouble. They did nothing. They—just like they've been weak on China, they've been weak on Russia. They've been weak on everyone. And they were the weakest of all on Iran.\nNo, that was a great deal made by very talented people that work with me. And it's been praised all over the world. And what you'll see now is, other countries will come into that deal, and you'll have peace in the Middle East. And Biden doesn't even know—he doesn't even know the name of the countries I'm talking about.\nThank you very much, everybody. We'll see you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1254"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference in Bedminster, New Jersey", "Date": "2020-08-15", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. And thank you for being here. Let me provide a brief update on the China virus, as well as our economic recovery, which is going really very well, as you probably have been hearing.\nNearly 85 percent of jurisdictions all across our country are reporting a very steep decline in cases, and that's despite the fact that we have the number one testing program anywhere in the world. We're up to almost 70 million tests, far beyond any other country. This week, cases nationwide have declined by 6 percent; the test positivity rate has fallen to just 6.5 percent, a 71 percent reduction from April and a 15 percent reduction from mid-July. That's a big reduction. The hospitalization rate for the virus has been reduced by half since April.\nAnd I urge everyone to apply commonsense mitigation. We know that. And we are all doing that, and I want to thank the American people for really doing such a great job.\nThe United States has now administered over 70 million tests, more than all of the European Union combined. If you combine all of Europe, it's less than what we do. Millions of point-of-care tests are processed in less than 24 hours and many in under 15 minutes. Nearly 80 percent of all commercial lab test results are now returned within 3 days. So we've gotten that number down from about 8 days to 3 days, and that's only in the longer-term lab cases. But we have many 15-minute tests; we have some 5-minute tests. The turnaround time for Federal surge testing sites is just 2 days. So when you send them out, despite the fact that you have a delivery time, which you can't do anything about, it's all the way down to 2 days. That's a very substantial reduction. Great job by the people that do it.\nWe are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals. Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1 percent of the U.S. population, but account for nearly half of all fatalities. That's an incredible thing. So it's 1 percent of the U.S. population, but they account for nearly half of the fatalities from the China virus. That's why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment. And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.\nIn the coming days, we've worked very hard with nursing home companies and also with the Governors—50 Governors all around the United States—and we have developed a very good relationship with most of the Governors. And I think, for the most part, they're doing a really good job. They're focused very heavily on nursing homes. And when they need equipment that they can't get—remember, they're supposed to get it, but when they can't get, we have tremendous amounts of equipment in stock.\nThanks to my administration's decisive action to save American jobs, we're currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. And that's because the foundation that we set previously, before the virus came and hit our shore—the foundation was so strong; we had such a strong foundation that we're recovering much faster than anybody anticipated. It turns out that it will be a very, very strong \"V,\" and you'll see that in just a second.\nSo retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an alltime high. That's not alltime for this month or last month; that's at an alltime high, and you see that with the chart. This was previous to the plague, I call it—the plague coming into our land, and really affected 188—dealing with 188 countries. And if you see, we've not only recovered, but we're at a much higher level than we were even then. That's an incredible number that nobody thought would even be possible. So we're currently witnessing the fastest economic recovery in American history. That's an amazing statement.\nSo retail spending is great, and now, if they would put up—auto production has surged 28 percent, and that's your auto production, which is right there.\n[At this point, the President displayed a chart.]\nSo you'll see that that's now about even to where it was, and that was at an alltime record high, and we're already even.\nAnd if you had a chart for used cars, you'd see that used car sales are setting a record, and that's great for production because when the used cars are practically not available—they're very, very tight—that means you're going to make a lot of new cars. So that number is going to go up even beyond what it is right now, but that's a fantastic number. That's a number that's the equivalent of where it was, and that was a record.\nSo you see what's happening with respect to the economy and the recovery. And the stock market is almost at an alltime high. In fact, NASDAQ is at an alltime high. It's had 14 days where we broke the record already over the last 2 months. So a lot of great things are happening.\nThrough the historic relief package that I signed into law, we saved over 50 million American jobs—50 million American jobs—and the unemployment rate is rapidly going down. You see that. You've seen that. And I think you'll see it over the next 2 months, and you'll have a good report even prior to the election. You're going to have a very good report. I think you're going to have an incredible GDP. You're going to have a tremendous report on business, and a lot of it's going to be released, which is very fortunate, prior to the election.\nI think the Democrats are going out of their way to try and do whatever they can to stop these kind of numbers. They don't like these kind of numbers, because they think it'll hurt them in the election. I think we all have to pull together and we have to do the right job, and we have to do what's good for the American people.\nWe were unfairly treated by China, because they could have stopped it. With that being said, China has purchased the most amount of corn in history. They—last week, they purchased the 2 largest days in the history of corn purchase and a massive amount of soybeans. Also cattle.\nSo China has been buying a lot of things, and they are doing that to keep me happy, but they're dreaming about Joe Biden. They would love to have that happen, but I don't think that's going to happen. They are dreaming about him and so is Iran—dreaming about Joe—and so are numerous other countries. They dream about it because if that happens, they'll own the United States. And China, I can tell you, specifically, will own the United States. Can't let that happen.\nIf you remember, China had the worst year they've had in 67 years prior to the plague coming to our shores. And we are now starting to do really well. We're going to have a very good third quarter, maybe a great third quarter. And we're going to have an incredible next year, unless somebody comes up and quadruples taxes, which is what they're talking about doing.\nAnd also, regulations we've set—we've done more in terms of cutting regulations than any administration in history by far, whether it was 4 years or 8 years or, in one case, more than 8 years. We have, in less than 4 years, done more regulation cutting by far. And we're doing more as we go. Some of it is statutory; you can only do it at a certain pace. You have to wait 90 days, you have to wait 120 days before you can take the next step. We have tremendous regulation cutting coming. With that being said, we're going to have certain regulations to protect the environment and also safety. Small business optimism has come surging back. In June, it was higher than any month under the previous administration. Think of that. So small business optimism was higher than any month under the previous administration. And that is while we're going through a pandemic, a worldwide pandemic, you have a number like that. And when you see the numbers that we quoted just now as to what's happening with cases and all of the other hospitalization rates, a lot of tremendous things are happening.\nIndustrial production is increasing at the fastest rate ever recorded. I mean, think of these numbers. I mean, how does that happen? Industrial production is increasing at the fastest rate on record, which is \"ever recorded.\"\nConsumer spending is expected to grow at an astronomical rate this quarter. So we don't have the number yet, but it looks like it's going to be at an astronomical rate.\nI want to say that I want college football to come back. These are strong, healthy, incredible people. These are people that want to play football very badly. A great, great talent at quarterback, Trevor Lawrence, called me on—2 days ago. I spoke to him a couple of times. And he said, \"Sir, I want to just tell you we want it back, we want to play.\" And he's an incredible quarterback, as you know, from an incredible school, Clemson. And he's going to have a very good future in the NFL. He's got everything. He's got height, accuracy, a strong arm, and he's fast. Other than that, I guess he's got some problems. [Laughter] But he's got the whole package. I watched him last year running. He was faster than the backs that were guarding. I think he's going to be great.\nBut he's just a great young man. I talked to him actually for a long time. They want to play football. And he made the statement that he feels he's safer on the field. He's safer on the field than he is out—you know, outside of the field. He feels very safe.\nAnd if you look, the SEC, the Big 12, and the ACC are back. They want to come back, and I think they're coming back. The Big 10, the Pac 12, are not, and I wish they would come back.\nAnd, you know, I just want to say it's sort of sad, because I've been fighting for football to come back. We're trying to help the NFL, as long as they stand for our National Anthem, as long as they honor our flag and our country. If they start kneeling, I'm not going to be helping them much. They might come back, but I won't be watching. Neither will a lot of other people.\nI think what the NBA did was atrocious. I thought it was disgraceful the way they kneeled. And their ratings are reflective of that. But I think football has to get smart. That's the NFL; let's see what happens. But if they do it—they learned their lesson, I thought, 2 years ago, when people started not watching and when people really weren't going to the game so much. A lot of empty seats all of a sudden. So they're going to learn that lesson again if they don't wise up.\nBut I just want to say—so, Trevor Lawrence, great. And some of the great people—SEC, Big 12, ACC—I want to thank them, and I want to congratulate them for coming back.\nI want to also mention that CNN had a story that, \"Will they blame Trump for football in the swing States?\" What a dishonest story that is. Will they blame me? I'm the one that's pushing them to come back. So they want to try and blame me. So them and, I guess, the New York Times reported one person—it was one person in the story—one person said maybe it's Trump's fault. And I'm the one pushing them back.\nSo I'd like to see college football come back. I'd like to see them come back proud and strong. I was very impressed by Trevor. I was very impressed by other people that called me. Players called me, coaches called me—Coach O. If you want a coach who's central casting for a movie—if you're doing a movie, you have to put Coach O as the head, because this guy is central casting. But when you have guys like Nick Saban and others calling for it to come back—they want it to come back. And these are great athletes. These are not people that seem to be at all susceptible to this horrible disease. And they want to play football. And we have great testing, so you'll be able to test.\nAnd when CNN and the New York Times—the New York Times quoted one person—one person. And I'm the one pushing. So we'll get it straight: I'm the one pushing for football to come back. I think if I wasn't pushing, you wouldn't have anything happening.\nSo, with that, we'll take—we'll take a few questions. Steve [Steve A. Holland, Reuters], please.\nIran/U.S. Seizure of Iranian Oil Tankers/Economic Stimulus Legislation\nYes.\nWell, we knew what the vote was going to be, but we'll be doing a snapback. You'll be watching it next week.\nYes, you'll be watching it next week.\nYes.\nHe has asked.\nProbably not. No, I think we want to wait until after the election. Look, Iran wants me to lose so badly, because if they do—you know, Iran is a whole different ballgame right now. They haven't been sponsoring terror because they don't have very much money to sponsor terror, and they know we just captured four Iranian ships, as you know, and we brought them into Houston. They were going to Venezuela; they're not supposed to be doing that. Iran would love to have me defeated.\nIf I win, which I hope to win—how can you not when you see numbers like this, both on the virus and on the economy? I mean, we should win. We should all be—keep this incredible thing going. And I built it once and I'll build it again. I've already—I think the hardest part is done in terms of the economy. And that's with or without additional funds from Nancy Pelosi. They should have put the things in—whether you call it the CARE Act or phase one, phase two, phase three—but they didn't do that. You know, they put it at the end, things that they're asking for that have nothing to do with corona, that have everything to do with radical-left politics.\nWell, we'll see.\nWell, we have a man in there for 2 months. He's a very talented man. He's a brilliant business person. He's done great. He's a very nice man also. And he—Louis—he is working very hard.\nBut as you know, the Democrats aren't approving the proper funding for Postal, and they're not approving the proper funding for this ridiculous thing that they want to do, which is all mail-in voting. Universal, you could call it, mail-in voting.\nAgain, absentee voting is great. You request—I'm an absentee voter because I requested, I got, and then I sent in my vote. So that works out very well. That's what we've had. But now they want to send in millions and millions of ballots. And you see what's happening. They're being lost, they're being discarded. They're finding them in piles. It's going to be a catastrophe. So—and this is beyond the Post Office.\nBut Louis DeJoy is working very hard. The Post Office has, for decades, lost billions and billions of dollars. I read numbers today that are unthinkable. And what they want to do now is hit the Post Office with millions of ballots from certain States. And if you look at what happened in New York and Virginia and various other places, it's a catastrophe. They're losing 20 percent of the votes. Nobody knows what's happened.\nSo we're going to see what happens. But I do say this: Universal mail-in voting is going to be catastrophic. It's going to make our country a laughingstock all over the world. You can't send out millions of ballots.\nAnd look at all of the tests. Look, you've seen them, and there are many. Far more—just look at New York. Look at New Jersey. Look at the catastrophe in New Jersey. And New Jersey had more than just Paterson. Look at what's going on in Virginia. Look at what's happening with this mail-in voting. It's a disgrace. Absentee is good; mail-in, universal, is very, very bad. There's no way they're going to get it accurately. They're off by 20 and 30 percent. And this is beyond Post Office.\nNow, with that being said, they want money for the universal mail-in ballots, and they're not getting it. You know why? Because of them. We want money to go to people. They want money in order to bail out States that have done very poorly. The States that have done poorly, you know them as well as I do, these are run by Democrats, usually radical-left Democrats.\nYou take a look at what's happening in Portland. And we'll go into Portland—we have to be asked—we'll go into Portland, straighten it out in 1 hour, like happened in Minneapolis. We'll go straighten it out in 1 hour. We will straighten that out so fast, but they have to ask us.\nSo they need money, but they're not willing to approve the money that they need. If they can't get the money that they need for universal mail-in voting, I don't see how they can have it. And that's not only Post Office, it's also for the voting itself.\nYes. He's a fantastic man.\nHe wants to make the Post Office great again. Do you ever hear the expression? He wants to make the Post Office great again.\nThe Post Office is a catastrophe.\nI don't know what he's doing. I can only tell you he's a very smart man. He'll be a great Postmaster General. And he needs—obviously, if you're going to do these millions of ballots out of nowhere, he's going to obviously need funding. But the Democrats aren't willing to provide other things and therefore they're not going to get the funding for that.\nBut you are going to have a catastrophic situation with universal mail-in votes. And, on top of it, the Democrats aren't willing to give the people the money and the Post Office the money.\nVote-by-Mail Policies/2020 Presidential Election/U.S. Postal Service\nWell, the problem with the mail-in voting, number one, you're never going to know when the election is over. Okay? I mean, they called the election in New York for Carolyn Maloney. They shouldn't have done that. I think you should redo that election. And, you know, the opponent is screaming. They can't believe it. Ballots are lost. Ballots are defrauded. It's a total mess. And they called it for her. The reason is because I've been using it as a case. I've been using it as a case. So, look——\nWe are going to have an election that takes place on a beautiful day, November 3. And usually, at the end of the evening, they say, \"Donald Trump has won the election.\" \"Donald Trump is your new President.\" Whatever they say.\nYou know what? You're not going to know this—possibly, if you really did it right—for months or for years, because these ballots are all going to be lost. They're going to be gone. And just take a look on a smaller basis—but it's great tests. We're doing tests. I mean, these are—you could call them polls, you could call them tests. Look at what's happening all over the country, where you have universal mail-in——\nWait a minute. The ballots are lost. There's fraud. There's theft. It's happening all over the place.\nNow, we're going to do it with this whole, vast, big section of the country. It's crazy.\nNo, not at all. He would love to see it happen. I didn't speak to him about it, but I will tell you this: I would imagine he would say number one, they didn't give me the funding for it, because it's sitting in Congress, because they want a trillion dollars to bail out States, just so you——\n——understand what they want.\nThey want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run Democrat-run States, okay? That's what they want. They're not giving the money to the Post Office. They have to give the money to the Post Office.\nYes. Yes.\nNo, not at all. The steps that he is taking are trying to stop the tremendous losses that have taken place for many, many years. He's trying to streamline the Post Office and make it great again. Okay?\nWell, wait a minute. You just threw—look, I just read last night that now New Jersey is going to try the universal mail-in voting. Well, they didn't know this. So now, all of a sudden, New Jersey is going to be hit with millions of ballots to be sent out. They didn't know anything about this.\nSo how does a Post Office—how does a Postal Service that doesn't know about it, now all of a sudden, New Jersey is supposed to take out, and millions of ballots are going to be sent all over New Jersey?\nAnd if you look at some of the things they say, like in—take the State of Nevada, take that little scam that's going on over there with the clubhouse politician Governor. Take that, where the votes don't even have to be in until 7—they get counted 7 days after November 3. That means if—Nevada is a very important State. I think we have a great chance of winning that State. If the votes don't have to be in for 7—and they're not counting the votes—7 days later, that means how are they going to predict a winner on November 3?\nNo, absentee is okay.\nBut the Democrats are not—they are not approving the resources. You're right, there has to be more resources, I agree, because all of a sudden——\n——the Post Office is tripling up instead.\nThe problem is the Democrats are not approving the funds necessary. It's in there. Now, they have $25 billion. I've seen $15 billion. I've seen a lot of money. I don't know how you're going to spend that much, but that's what they're saying. They're saying. So not only do they want a trillion dollars to hand out as welfare to all these States that are run by Democrats doing badly, they want $25 billion for the Post Office. But they're not approving it.\nNow, what I want is a lot of money—thousands of dollars—to go to people because they need money. They really—despite the good numbers, despite numbers like that, they need money to live. And I want that to happen. The Democrats don't care about that. They just want to give bailout money to their friends running big States poorly.\nGo ahead.\nWell, I'm going to look at it. I mean, I'm not that aware of the Snowden situation, but I'm going to start looking at it. There are many, many people—it seems to be a split decision that many people think that he should be somehow treated differently, and other people think he did very bad things. And I'm going to take a very good look at it. Okay?\nI mean, I've seen people that are very conservative and very liberal, and they agree on the same issue; they agree both ways. I'm going to take a look at that very strongly, Edward Snowden.\nYes, please.\nNo, I mean, you can't compare it to 1917. That was incredible. That was—that was the worst ever by far. That was—you look at—they lost possibly 100 million people. No, I don't agree with that.\nBut if you look at these numbers, they're coming down very substantially. And I do believe that Americans—many are wearing masks, which is a good thing. Again, some people thought that you shouldn't wear a mask. You know, when this whole thing started, Dr. Fauci, who I like and respect, said \"don't wear masks,\" okay? And so did Dr. Redfield. And then, all of a sudden, it was like everybody should wear masks. And that's okay. People can change their mind.\nBut wash your hands, good hygiene—all of those things—I think people are really doing it to a level that they've never done before.\nAnd when you look at the numbers, the way the numbers are coming out, I mean, it's very impressive when you see what's happening.\nBy the way, Florida doing well. You see that. And hospitalizations and all—you know, normally you would have had to build more—like we did for the first surge. We've done it right. We closed it up. We had the greatest economy in history. We closed it up. We understand the disease now. Nobody knew. Nobody knew what was hitting us, right? Nobody knew that old people would be very, very susceptible, especially if they have heart and diabetes problems and other problems; that old people would be very susceptible and young people would be extremely good with it. If you look at the percentages, there are a tiny percentage that have problems, especially the big problem.\nSo, no, I think that we're doing very well. We're on our way. And we're also opening up our economy, and our economy is going to set records. And if stupid people aren't elected next year, we're going to have one of the greatest years that we've ever had.\nJennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], go ahead, please.\nHuawei Technologies Company, Ltd.\nYes.\nWell, the big thing is Huawei, right? Huawei is not here. And Huawei, I'm not allowing. And I've told European countries and others—Australia has been fantastic, as an example. But Huawei is not coming here.\nAnd we told certain countries that were thinking about Huawei: \"That's okay, you can use them, but we're not going to be sharing intelligence.\" And they've all backed away. You look at the U.K., it looked like they were going that way, and now they backed out—Scotland Yard.\nThere are most—well, yes.\nWe're looking at other things. Yes, we are. We are.\nWell, you'll have to ask him. I know this: He's a very efficient operator, a very good operator, but again, he needs money to operate if you're going to hit him with millions of ballots.\nAnd if you ask him, he will tell you, and he'll tell you very nicely: You have the money, it's sitting there, it's ready to go. The Democrats don't want to approve it, but I want money for other things too. I want money to go to people so they can live very nicely, because China caused the problem; they didn't.\nGo ahead.\nSo, I have nothing to do with that. I read something about it. And I will say that he is a brilliant lawyer that—I guess he wrote an article about it. So I know nothing about it, but it's not something that bothers me.\nWhy do you say that? I just don't know about it, but it's not something that we will be pursuing.\nLet me put it differently.\nLet me put it differently. Don't tell me what I know. [Laughter] Let me put it differently. Let me put it differently: To me, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't know about it. I read one quick article. The lawyer happens to be a brilliant lawyer, as you probably know. He wrote an article saying there could be a problem. It's not something that I'm going to be pursuing.\nI just told you, I have not gone into it in great detail. If she's got a problem, you would have thought that she would——\n——have been vetted.\nYou would have thought that she would have been vetted by Sleepy Joe.\nYes, go ahead.\nSo I think we've done very well. We've had three phases. We're into phase four. We've gotten everything we wanted. And we've also gotten a great economy. All you have to do is take a look at these charts. Our economy is doing good. But we want different things than them. I want money for the people; they want money to bail out Democrat Governors and Democrat mayors.\nListen to me. Listen to me. My people are doing very good. And my people call me. They're in the office; they call me. They call me. When it's right—nobody knows the deal better than I do. When it's right, I'll meet. But right now it's not right. They want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run States—they're Democrat. They're all—I mean, they're Democrat States. Will something happen? Possibly. But I want to tell you, the country is doing very well right now. We can live very happily with it, without it. But I'd like to do it, because I want to give money to the people. I want to put money into the people's hands. They want to put money into politicians' hands so that the politicians don't look stupid.\nMark \"Yesper\"? Did you call him \"Yesper\"?\nOh, okay. Some people call him \"Yesper.\" No, I get along with him. I get along with him fine. He's fine.\nYes. No problem.\nI consider firing everybody. [Laughter] At some point, that's what happens.\nJennifer [Jennifer Jacobs, Bloomberg News], do you have something, Jennifer? You're working so hard.\nSo, if we have the success—I think we have a silent majority, the likes of which has never been seen before—I think you read about it—where 62 percent of the people say they're not even telling the truth on polling and where the polling is fake; you know, where they do registered voters and where they do many more Democrats than they do Republicans. Same as happened last time.\nBut this year, I think we have much more enthusiasm. Maybe those people back there would understand it better than anybody. But I think there's more enthusiasm for 2020 than there was even for 2016. And 2016 was a record. You found that out. And I believe there's much more enthusiasm now than there was even in 2016.\nWe have a silent majority, the likes of which nobody has seen. I just looked—there are thousands of boats in lakes, rivers, and oceans. Thousands and thousands of boats. It's called \"Boaters for Trump,\" \"Boaters for Trump-Pence.\" There's signs all over. Some of the boats have 10 flags on them. They're incredible. There are thousands. We did nothing to do this. This is just generic. It just happened.\nLet me just tell you, I think the level of enthusiasm for what we're doing—we want law and order. We want low taxes. They want to raise your taxes. They want to get rid of—they want to have open borders. And they want to defund the police. How do you win on that? They want to go to Texas, and they want to go to Pennsylvania, and they want to stop fracking. And Ohio, they want to stop fracking. They're against steel, they're against anything with petroleum, the word petroleum in it. You won't have a country. These people are crazy.\nSay it? Go ahead.\nWell, I don't know. I think for next year—I mean, generally speaking, a lot of times I understand when, if we win, a President will ask for the resignation of everybody and then bring back the people he wants. That's happened before, Steve. And I could see something like that happening. I think that makes sense.\nNo, I have a very good Cabinet—I mean, with few exception. I wouldn't say I'm thrilled with everybody, frankly. [Laughter]. But I have—overall, I think we have a very good Cabinet.\nI think this—I will say this: No administration—none—no administration, first 3½ years, has done anywhere near what we've done. Three hundred—we will have, at the end of the first term, 300, maybe more, Federal judges including Court of Appeals, two Supreme Court Justices. Nobody has done this.\nTake a look at—take a look at what we've done: the biggest tax cuts in history; the biggest regulation cuts in history; rebuilt our military; took care of our vets. We have a 91 percent approval rating from the vets. Nobody has ever had a 91 percent approval rating before. We—I guarded the Second Amendment. They want to destroy the Second Amendment. Take a look at Kamala. They want to destroy the Second Amendment.\nAnd, as you know, Joe is—has no control over anybody. He has no control over himself.\nOkay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-bedminster-new-jersey-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-19", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I'd like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.\nToday I'm directing the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to notify the U.N. Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran. It's a snapback, not uncommon.\nTwo years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which was a product of the Obama-Biden foreign policy failure, a failure like few people have seen, in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short-term deal. This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to Iran—$150 billion, to be exact—plus $1.8 billion in cash, which I don't know that the President had the authority to give; gave $1.8 billion in cash. Just another great deal that turned out to be a total disaster, that would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.\nAnd I won't say anything, because I don't like saying it, but Iran doesn't have so much money to give to the world anymore, to the terrorists, to give to Al Qaida and various other groups of people that they were funding. They have to keep their own regime together, and it's not easy for them.\nAnd if and when I win the election, within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly.\nBut that deal was a disaster: $150 billion; $1.8 billion in cash. And we got nothing, except a short-term, little deal. A short-term, expiring. It's starting to expire already. It's terminated, but it would have, if we didn't terminate it, start to expire very shortly.\nA good deal was the deal we made with U.A.E. and Israel. And, by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal, countries that you wouldn't even believe want to come into that deal. And, all of a sudden, you're going to have peace in the Middle East, and you couldn't have done it with this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with Sleepy Joe Biden.\nI imposed the toughest ever sanctions on Iran, and this has caused great difficulty for them giving money to terrorist organizations. And if they do, they'll have hell to pay.\nEarlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world's number-one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, in addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the two leading terrorists by far in the world. The founder of ISIS. Nobody even talks about that. And we also defeated—we now have 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. When I took over, it was a mess. It was a total mess. It was—they were all over the place.\nMy administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on. They will never have a nuclear weapon. Iran will never have—mark it down. Mark it down: Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the U.N. sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy, a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East. Here at home, through Operation LeGend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat-run American cities. It's absolutely shocking. When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles—Democrat-run cities—they're a mess because they don't get it. Either they don't get it or there's something that nobody else understands.\nWe've deployed more than 1,000 additional Federal agents to help these Democrat-run disasters. We just have done this. We have to give them a hand. And we can stop it immediately, like at Portland would be so easy to stop. We'd stop it immediately.\nWe only sent in some Homeland people—who are great, by the way—to save the courthouse, because it would have been blown up or burned down, and they did that very easily. But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it's Homeland, whether it's FBI, whether it's just law enforcement—and we'd send them in quickly. We would eradicate it, just like happened in Minneapolis. As soon as they were called in—they should have been called in a lot sooner; you would have had far less damage.\nToday we announced that Operation LeGend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already. Bad ones. Bad ones. Really bad people. Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow. And they'll be a very long time in prison for what they've done to these cities. Most cities are well run; most of the Nation is well run. And the areas that we're talking about are all—in all cases, run by Democrats, usually radical-left-leaning Democrats, like in New York or in Portland.\nWe've made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Memphis, and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson, and 91 murders.\nWe're also using the full power of the Federal Government to defeat, as you know, the China virus. New cases have declined in 80 percent of the jurisdictions in the past week. Eighty percent. New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak. And other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look—because we've done an incredible job—but they're having a lot of outbreaks, but they'll be able to put them out, and we put them out.\nThe hospitalization rate has fallen in our country, 54 percent since its peak in April. Fifty-four percent. Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus: 92 percent of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older. Only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred among those 44 years—think of that—44 years and younger. So 44 years old and younger: only 2.7 percent of deaths have occurred. And many of those people had preexisting conditions, they had problems—heart, diabetes, and other problems, but—many of those. So think of that: only 2.7 percent under 44 years of age.\nExcess mortality in Europe this year is 33 percent higher than the United States, evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations. South Korea—you've been reading about South Korea doing well. Well, they just had a very big breakout, but they'll be able to solve the problem.\nWe must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk, as we know. Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching. We have learned one thing: There's nothing like campus, there's nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board. It's been proven a lot better. It's a lot better. The iPads are wonderful, but you're not going to learn the same way you do by being there. So, nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching. For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal few—a seasonal flu. And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don't talk about it in the same way, and they shouldn't. But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to.\nInstead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans. Makes sense.\nAnd the shutdown thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down. You look at certain areas that—in all cases, Democrat run—still shut down, and the numbers there aren't even good. But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse. A lot of problems are being caused—probably far more, I would say, Scott, than is caused by the virus itself, now that we understand the virus.\nColleges should take reasonable precautions. Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction, as they would for any other illness. And universities should implement measures to protect the high-risk students or professors and teachers.\nThe ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high-risk settings—and to prevent transmission, period, but especially in nursing homes—and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.\nWe have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country. We have a tremendous unused testing capacity. It's something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us.\nIn our path forward, we will continue to follow a science-based approach to protecting the high-risk, while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work and school. Our country will be open. Our country is getting open quickly. Our stock markets are almost back to where they were, prior to the China virus disaster coming in.\nAnd I want to thank you all for being here, and we'll take some questions.\nYes, please.\nQAnon Conspiracy Theory/Protests and Civil Unrest in U.S. Cities/Deployment of Federal Law Enforcement Officers to U.S Cities\nWell, I don't know much about the movement, other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate, but I don't know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I hear, it's—these are people that, when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York City in just the last 6 or 7 months—but this was starting even 4 years ago when I came here. Almost 4 years; can you believe it? These are people that don't like seeing what's going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and States. And I've heard these are people that love our country, and they just don't like seeing it.\nSo I don't know, really, anything about it other than they do, supposedly, like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas—like, especially the areas that we're talking about—go away. Because there's no reason the Democrats can't run a city. And if they can't, we will send in all of the Federal—whether it's troops or law enforcement, whatever they'd like—we'll send them in. We'll straighten out their problem in 24 hours or less. Okay?\nWell, I haven't heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, you know, if I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it. I'm willing to put myself out there.\nAnd we are, actually. We're saving the world from a radical-left philosophy that will destroy this country. And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That's the importance of this country.\nAnd when you look at some of the things that these people are saying, with \"defund the police\" and no borders, open borders—everybody just pour right into our country; no testing, no nothing. You know, you talk about testing—no testing. Mexico, as you know, has a very high rate of infection.\nThe wall is now going to be, next week, 300 miles long. Our numbers are extraordinary on the border. Had that—and this is through luck, perhaps, more than talent, although the talent is getting built when one party refuses to allow it. You don't hear talk about the wall anymore.\nBut I will say this: We need strength in our country, not weakness. Too much weakness.\nYes, John [John Roberts, Fox News]. Please.\nYes.\nWell, I hear great things about it, John. That's all I can tell you. And it could be a political decision, because you have a lot of people over there that don't want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3. And you've heard that one before.\nBut I've heard fantastic things about convalescent plasma. And I've heard numbers way over 50-percent success. And people are dying, and we should have it approved if it's good. And I'm hearing it's good. I heard from people at the FDA that it's good. So we'll see. I'm going to check that right after this conference.\nWell, if the numbers are as good as I'm hearing—I mean, I'm hearing over 50 percent, and that's very good. And we've approved—certain things are at 31 percent, and that's okay, too; that's not bad. And it's really had a tremendous impact.\nBut, no, I have—you're telling me something right now that surprises me, but we'll check it out right after this.\nI don't want delays. I don't want people dying. I don't want people dying.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, I'm not happy with Goodyear, because what they're doing is playing politics. And the funny thing is, the people that work for Goodyear, I can guarantee you I poll very well with all of those great workers in Goodyear.\nAnd when they say that you can't have \"Blue Lives Matter,\" you can't show a blue line, you can't wear a MAGA hat, but you can have other things that are Marxist in nature, there's something wrong with the top of Goodyear.\nAnd what the radical left does is, they make it impossible for people to do business if they're Republican or if they're conservative. They put out all sorts of effort: \"Don't shop there.\" They do vicious things, not so different than what you saw on the streets of Portland 2 nights ago.\nOh, I don't know. That's up to people. But I wouldn't recommend it. If they want to hold political speech, if they want to let you not do what everybody is doing; if they want to wear a MAGA hat or if they want to wear a \"Blue Lives\"—you know what \"Blue Lives Matter,\" right? That's police men and women. That's a terrible thing. That's a terrible thing.\nSo they're using their power over these people, and these people want to wear whatever it is that we're talking about. You know that. And so I would be very much in favor if people don't want to buy there. And you know what? They'll be able to get a good job, because we set a jobs record over the last quarter, as you know. The most jobs ever in the history of our country. You'll be able to get another good jobs. I think it's disgraceful that they did this.\nPlease, go ahead, in the back.\nWell, I send him best wishes. I hear he's a wonderful gentleman. He's certainly a brave man. And I send him best wishes.\nWith that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we've taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong. We essentially subsidized Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives. And that's what made Hong Kong—the exchange and business in Hong Kong—successful. I've taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business. You know, we really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom.\nBut now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions and billions of dollars. And all of that business will come into our country, including the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. And it'll all come here.\nBut I feel badly for him because I hear he's a good person. I don't know him, but I hear he's a good person; obviously, a very brave person.\nDid you have something? Go ahead, please.\nIraq/Drawdown of U.S. Troops From Afghanistan/Syria/Turkey/U.S. Military Strength\nSay it?\nWell, this is a man that I get along with very well. We're largely out of Iraq. We're down to a very few soldiers. I said we're getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous, endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there. In the Middle East, we should have never been. But we're getting out rapidly, out of—you know, over the course of 3 years. And getting out—it's very sticky getting out. And some people agree, and many people don't agree, but I think most people very much agree.\nWe're doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan. We're getting out. We're down to a much smaller number of people left there. And you know, I greet men and women coming home, and coming home after they've been hit. I've also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in.\nAnd we've been there 19 years, and we're basically policemen. We're acting as police, as opposed to soldiers. And they're going to have to police their own states, and they've been doing that for thousands of years. But it's time, after 19 years, that our soldiers come home.\nThey've done an incredible job, but you know, they don't—they're not allowed to fight to win. And maybe they shouldn't be, because a lot of the people—it's not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq—again, we're down in Afghanistan; very low numbers. And that'll be taking place.\nAnd I let them know, \"Do anything, and you'll be hit like you've never hit—be hit—been hit before.\" So we're doing very well. Syria, the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey. Right? And everybody said, \"Oh, this is\"—that was 2 years ago. It was a long time ago. They said: \"Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible. We're going to leave.\"\nWhy do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan. And Syria has been fighting forever. And I say, \"Why are we guarding their border?\" And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out. And guess what? Nothing's happened. They've been fighting like they have been for a thousand years. Okay? Nothing's happened. And nobody mentions that.\nEverybody said, \"This is going to be a disaster.\" There's no disaster; nothing's happened. And so we're getting out of the endless wars. And we are building a military, the likes of which the world has never seen: $2½ trillion we have spent. And we, hopefully, don't ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture.\nIt's—when you look at what China is doing, when you look at what Russia is doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing, we want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe. We don't want to see that; we don't want to ever use it. We've rebuilt our military: new missiles and new rockets and new tanks and new everything. New everything—$2½ trillion—all made in the U.S.A.\nAnd we've upgraded incredibly our nuclear capability. And some of our nuclear needed nourishment. It needed new strength. And we've upgraded it very, very significantly. I mean, to a level that nobody would even believe. And hopefully, we don't—you pray to God we never have to use it. Okay? But we've never been in a position where we've been this strong.\nYes.\nHaving to do with U.A.E. and Israel.\nCorrect.\nI do.\nNo, I think they'll—I think—look, they've definitely got the money to pay for it. You know, it's nice because usually when we—a lot of times, we make deals; they don't have 10 cents, these countries we deal with. We give it to them like, \"How about paying this back later?\" But they never pay because they don't have the money.\nNo, they have the money, and they would like to order quite a few F-35s; it's the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by far. Stealth. Totally stealth. You can't see it. Makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot: \"What do you think is better, this one? This one? That one?\" Talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes. He said, \"Well, the advantage we have is you can't see it.\" So when we're fighting, they can't see us. I say, \"That sounds like a really big advantage to me.\" To these guys——\nYou know, they look—by the way, I said to these pilots that I meet—they look better than Tom Cruise, and they're definitely tougher. And he's a nice guy. But these people are amazing. And I speak to them a lot about it—\"What do you think?\"—you know, as I go around to the various places. I saved the big one in Florida, as an example. That was a big one. Knocked down, pretty much, by the hurricane. So I spent a lot of time on that. And it's the greatest plane in the world. One thing about that kind of thing—technology, high-technology—the greatest plane doesn't last long. Somebody comes up with something else, but we're always the one to come up with something else.\nSo yes, they'd like to buy F-35s; we'll see what happens. It's under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East. Even the New York Times thought it was an incredible deal. Can you imagine that? Tom Friedman had a very nice thing to say about it. I spoke to him about it. He thought it was terrific. And it is terrific.\nI see a lot of countries coming in fairly quickly. And when you have them all in, ultimately, Iran will come in too. There'll be peace in the Middle East. That will be a nice. Iran will be very much neutralized. They never thought this could have happened.\nAnd with the horrendously stupid Iran deal signed by Obama, this could have never happened.\nYes.\nCorrect.\nYes, I would do that. I would. I would swap them out, based on what I heard. We'll see what happens. Hey, look, you're going to have a lot of people not wanting to buy that product anymore, and they'll buy from a competitor, made in the U.S.A. too. Okay?\nYou know, when I listen to that and then I see the horror that he's left us, the stupidity of the transactions that he made. Look what we're doing: We have our great border wall. We have security. We have the U.A.E. deal, which has been universally praised, praised by people that aren't exactly fans of Donald Trump for various reasons. I don't know why; can't be my personality. But they're not fans. Right?\nAnd when I look at what we have—now, look at how bad he was, how ineffective a President he was. He was so ineffective, so terrible. Slowest growing recovery in the history—I guess, since 1929—on the economy.\nDon't forget, until the China virus came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we're doing it again. I'm going to have to do it a second time. We're doing it again—hard to believe. We're doing very well. You heard the numbers; they're way, way down on the virus. But when you look at the kind of numbers that we're producing on the stock markets, we're almost at the level—in fact, NASDAQ and S&P are higher than they were at their highest point prior to the China virus coming in, the plague coming in.\nNo, President Obama did not do a good job. And the reason I'm here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden. Because if they did a good job, I wouldn't be here. And probably, if they did a good job, I wouldn't have even run. I would have been very happy. I enjoyed my previous life very much, but they did such a bad job that I stand before you as President.\nThank you all very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1258"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-23", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. And it's good to see you all. Hope you had a great weekend at your convention. And we're going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.\nBut before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I'd like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico.\nYesterday I approved a major disaster declaration for California—spoke to Governor Newsom—as they battle two of the worst wildfires in the history of their State. That continues. The Federal Government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires. We're working very closely with the Governor and very closely with a lot of great State representatives and local representatives, and we'll take care of the situation. But we have 26,000 first responders already.\nOur hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes. As we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire, one of the biggest we've ever seen. My administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly. Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana 2 days later. This is somewhat unprecedented: the scope of the storms and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another.\nBoth storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico. We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast, and we have tremendous—and tremendous people.\nWe have—FEMA is lined up. We have the Coast Guard ready. The Coast Guard has done a fantastic job. They do so many—they do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.\nI'm asking all Americans in the storm's path to follow the instructions of your State and local Governments very closely. And I've approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana. FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help. They will be in there very quickly—very, very quickly.\nAnd I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also, of Louisiana, and I've informed him. And at his request, also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go. We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California. So we have a great team. Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.\nOn the therapeutics front, this is what I've been looking to do for a long time. This is a great thing. Today I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization—and that's such a powerful term: emergency use authorization—for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It's had an incredible rate of success. Today's action will dramatically expand access to this treatment. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar. I want to thank the FDA—all of the people that have been working very hard on this. It showed tremendous potential.\nThis is the only possible—and it's only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed—that is everybody working together. We're years ahead of approvals. We would be—if we went by the speed levels of past administration, we'd be 2 years, 3 years behind where we are today, and that includes in vaccines that you'll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.\nTo deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we're removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the Federal Government.\nWe've provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. It's a tremendous number.\nThe FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease.\nBased on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.\nIn late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients to have—who have recovered—and these are patients that have been incredible, the way they've donated—but these are people recovered from the virus—to donate plasma. Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled.\nAnd today I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today, please. It's been really an incredible—just incredible people. The country has united so strongly behind this.\nAnd I'll go over the numbers, but if you look at what's happened and the success that we've had that people don't talk about, the United States has experienced the lowest case-fatality rate of any major country in the world. You don't hear that.\nThe European Union's case-fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States. Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.\nAnd I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn, to say a few words. And, Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up—and especially over the last few days—in getting this done. The results have been incredible, and I think you'll see the results even go up very substantially. So we appreciate it.\nAnd maybe I'll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen. Thank you very much, Alex.\nSecretary of Health and Human Services Alex M. Azar II.Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today.\nThanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19. And thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world. In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment.\nPresident Trump is the \"right to try\" President, and he's fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments. Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use, and this FDA authorization is one result of that effort.\nThe data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course—within 3 days of being diagnosed—with plasma containing high levels of antibodies benefited the most from treatment. We saw about a 35-percent better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment, which were patients under 80 who were not on artificial respiration.\nI just want to emphasize this point, because I don't want you to gloss over this number. We dream, in drug development, of something like a 35-percent mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients. This is a major advance.\nConvalescent plasma is one new tool that we've added to our arsenal against COVID-19, alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied. Because of the President's Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall.\nOperation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing, so that if they meet FDA's gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.\nAmericans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight. Know: If you donate plasma, you could save a life.\nWe've also provided guidance so health care providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.\nSo, thank you again, Mr. President, for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19. And I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they've approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA.\nAnd I'll turn it over to Dr. Hahn if that's okay, Mr. President.\nGood. Thank you very much.\nPlease, Doctor.\nCommissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen M. Hahn.Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership. It's good to be here today to announce FDA's recent decision. From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers. And I just want to echo the President's thanks to the more than 17,000 men and women who work at FDA. They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.\nSo plasma is the liquid portion of the blood. That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection—in this case, COVID-19—and that liquid portion can be extracted. And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, it's been given to patients with infectious diseases—for more than 100 years. So there was a really good rationale for why this might work. And, in fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded-access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the Federal Government, under President Trump's leadership, and that has gone on for the last 4 months. More than 90,000, close to 100,000 Americans have enrolled in this program, and over 70,000 have received treatment. This is one of the largest expanded-access programs in the history of FDA. So a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.\nSo, in the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data—not just the data from this expanded-access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this. Those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization.\nIn the optimal treatment—the optimal patients, as described by Secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35-percent improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit.\nNow, we're waiting for more data. We're going to continue to gather data. But this clearly meets the criteria that we've established for emergency use authorization, and we're very pleased with these results.\nSo let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35-percent improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit. What that means is—and if the data continue to pan out—100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.\nWe've seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country. And what this EUA does—EUA—emergency use authorization today does: It allows us to continue that and meet the demand.\nAnd again, I want to echo the President's and the Secretary's ask of the American people: If you've recovered from COVID-19, please donate. It could save a life.\nAnd, Mr. President, thank you again.\nThank you very much, Stephen. I appreciate it.\nOkay, any questions, please? Please, go ahead.\nRight.\nYou know, that's a great question. And I'm not sure a lot of people have been thinking about \"right to try.\" We're all waiting for the final answer. And maybe I could ask Stephen, but I would say that \"right to try\" is exactly—if somebody is virtually terminal—in other words, they're not going to make it—and if we have these incredible therapies and drugs that are happening, Alex, I think it's a very interesting question.\n——we're all waiting for that exact final endpoint.\nWhat about that, Stephen? We have all of these great—seemingly great answers that are ready to come out, but because of the process, it takes, though—can we use some of this early, under \"right to try\"? Please.\nI think it was something we have to really consider very strongly.\nI think it's fantastic.\nYou should get credit for that.\nThank you. That's very good.\nPlease, in the back. OAN, please.\nWell, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn't mind so much. That's my opinion—a very strong opinion. And that's for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics; this has to do with life and death.\nSo we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright, and we have got some incredible answers. And we're not going to let them be held up, because every day is lives. And we're not going to let that happen. Okay?\nVery good. Thank you.\nPlease, go ahead.\nOkay? This is a very big day. It's a day we've been looking forward to. Thank you very much. Great question. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1256"}

[applause]\nAnd to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert. [applause]\nLet us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our Vice President Mike Pence. [applause]\nAnd Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen. [applause]\nMy fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States. [applause and chanting \"USA\"]\nThe Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people. [applause]\nIn a new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity. [applause]\nWe will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery and we will reach for new heights of national achievement.\nWe will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country. [applause]\nBecause we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. [applause]\nGathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the People's House, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story.\nThis has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future.\nWithin these walls lived tenacious generals, like President Grant and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and unchartered continent.\nIn the depths of a bloody civil war, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument, and asked God, in his providence to save our nation.\nTwo weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill. And just inside they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.\nIn recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering life-saving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner. [applause]\nWe will defeat the virus and the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before. [applause]\nWhat united generations past was an unshakeable confidence in America's destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country's blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world.\nIt is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism.\nThis towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger.\nThis is the most important election in the history of our country. [applause]\nThank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between the parties, two visions, two philosophies or two agendas. This election will decide whether we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. [applause]\nIt will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas as has foolishly been done for many decades.\nYour vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists and agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens.\nAnd this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won't happen. [applause]\nAt the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So tonight I ask you a simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country? [applause]\nIn the Left's backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins.\nOur opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don't look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don't turn to government to restore our souls; we put our faith in almighty God. [applause]\nJoe Biden is not a savior of America's soul; he is the destroyer of America's jobs, and if given the chance he will be the destroyer of American greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses...[laughter and applause]...And told them he felt their pain. And then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands.\nJoe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended.\nFour years ago I ran for president because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by -- [applause] -- as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. [applause]\nAnd this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg who heads NATO was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. [applause]\nThank you. From the moment I left my former life behind -- and it was a good life --[laughter]-- I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive. Breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics: I kept my promise. [applause]\nTogether we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You've seen that. They are angry at me because, instead of putting them first, I very simply said America first. [applause]\nThank you.\nDays after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration's job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership. [applause]\nI then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines. [applause]\nEnded the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord. [applause]\nAnd secured for the first time American energy independence. [applause]\nWe passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before.\nWithin three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world.\nWashington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind.\nBut I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far. [applause]\nThey said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA. But again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law.\nAnd right now, auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries. [applause]\nAnd perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. [applause]\nBut I refused to back down, and today America's borders are more secure than ever before. [applause]\nThank you.\nWe ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud. Took down human traffickers who prey on women and children. And we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. [applause]\nWe have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete. And it is working beyond our wildest expectations. [applause]\nWe are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union representing our country's courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. [applause and chanting \"USA\"]\nYou see, this country loves our law enforcement. They do. [applause]\nThey do. They really do. Love and respect. When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower paid foreign replacement, I promptly removed the chairman of the board and now those talented American workers have been rehired and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina and Virginia. [applause]\nThey have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot. Please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. [applause]\nYou've been through a lot. Thank you very much. [applause]\nLast month, I took on Big Pharma. You think that's easy? It's not. And signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs and give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures. We passed the decades-long awaited right-to-try. Right-to-try. [applause]\nWe also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. [applause]\nOur great veterans, we're taking care of our veterans. [applause]\n91 percent approval rating this month, the VA, given by our veterans. First time anything like that's ever happened.\nBy the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great, new Supreme Court justices. [applause]\nAnd to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones and long-term funding of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans ever recorded. [applause]\nAnd I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. [applause]\nAnd I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. [applause]\nAnd when I'm re-elected, the best is yet to come. [applause and chanting \"four more years\"]\nThank you very much. [applause]\nWhen I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging. Iran was on the rise. And the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. [applause]\nUnlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel's true capital and moved our embassy to Jerusalem. [applause]\nBut not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already-owned existing building in a better location, real estate deal, right? [laughter and applause]\nAnd opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. [applause]\nMany things like that that government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. [applause]\nAnd this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. [applause]\nThank you to UAE. Thank you to Israel. [applause]\nIn addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. [applause]\nThen in a separate operation, we eliminated the world's number one terrorist by far, Qassem Solemeini.\nUnlike previous administrations I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. [applause]\nWe also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.\nWe have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years.\nBiden's record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single-worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China's entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time.\nAfter those Biden calamities the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They didn't want to hear Biden's hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back.\n[applause]\nAs vice president, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry.\nHe backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I've reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq War. He opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden. He opposed killing Soleimani. He oversaw the rise of ISIS and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That's why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that, upon very good information.\nChina would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused, all over the world, they caused.\nIn recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once in a century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it but they allowed it to come out.\nWe are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude. [applause]\nMany Americans, including me, have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken. So unnecessary. In their honor we will unite, in their memory we will overcome.\nAnd when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produced the world's largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. [applause]\nGood job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike, please stand up. Please. [applause]\nWe shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front-line healthcare workers. To protect our nation's seniors we rushed supplies, testing kits and personal … to nursing homes, we gave everything you can possibly give and we're still giving it because we're taking care of our senior citizens. [applause]\nThe Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals. And the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world.\nAmerica has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere combined. Think of that.\nWe have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that on Sunday night when we announced it. That will save thousands and thousands of lives.\nThanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rate and you look at it, and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80 percent since April. 80 percent. [applause]\nThe United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union's case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don't hear that. They don't write about that. They don't want to write about that. They don't want you to know those things.\nAll together, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that.\nWe enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That's one of the reasons that we're advancing so rapidly with our economy. [applause]\nGreat job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major Western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, and that's a record in the history of our country. [applause]\nUnfortunately, from the beginning our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. And then I introduced a ban on Europe very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.\nInstead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation's children's, families and citizens of all backgrounds.\nThe cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more.\nJoe Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but, rather, it's a surrender to the virus. [applause]\nMy administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower risk Americans to safely return to work and to school and we want to see so many of those great states be opened by Democrats. We want them to be open. They have to be open. They have to get back to work. [applause]\nThey have to get back to work, and they have to get back to school.\nMost importantly, we are marshalling America's scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time.\nUnder Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials, right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. Nobody thought it could ever be done this fast. Normally it would be years and we did it in a matter of a few months.\nWe're producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year. And together we will crush the virus. [applause]\nAt the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that's not because they don't have one; it's because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee.\nJoe Biden may claim he is an 'ally of the light,' but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. [laughter]\nHe doesn't have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy.\nAnd once again, record stock markets that we have right now will also collapse. That means your 401(k)s, that means all of the stocks you have.\nOn the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hard-working moms and dads. I will not raise taxes. I will cut them, and very substantially. [applause]\nAnd we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China back to America, and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. [applause]\nWe will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country as I've already been doing for quite some time, if you've noticed. Joe Biden's agenda is \"Made in China.\" My agenda is \"Made in the USA.\" [applause and chanting \"USA\"]\nBiden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale and natural gas, laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, destroying those states. Absolutely destroying those states, and others.\nMillions of jobs will be lost. And energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week, everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody has seen anything like it. But we saw that last week in California.\nHow can Joe Biden claim to be an \"ally of the light,\" when his own party can't even keep the lights on. [laughter and applause]\nJoe Biden's campaign has even published a 110 page policy platform, you can't get away from this. Coauthored with far left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders.\nThe Biden Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch and release and providing illegal aliens with free, taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come on over to our country, everybody has a lawyer, we have a lawyer for you. That's what we need is more lawyers. [laughter]\nJoe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised, here give away -- he was going to give it away, your healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring healthmassive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all of the goodies that they want to get, education, healthcare, everything.\nHe also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto.\nThe Biden plan would eliminate America's borders in the middle of a global pandemic. And he's even talking about taking the wall down. How about that? [booing]\nBiden also vowed to oppose school choice and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term I will expand charter schools and provide school choice to every family in America. [applause]\nAnd we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. [applause]\nGreat people. Great, great people. Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable. Yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up until the moment of birth.\nDemocrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby's beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life and then they lecture us about morality and saving America's soul.\nTonight we proudly declare that all children born and unborn have a God-given right to life. [applause]\nDuring the Democrat Convention, the words \"under God\" were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance, not once, but twice. We will never do that. [applause]\nBut the fact is, this is where they're coming from. Like it or not. This is where they're coming from. If the left gains power they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms.\nBiden is a trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn't have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many, many, we see them all the time, it's incredible, actually, then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He's not.\nThe most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods.\nWhen asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, \"Yes, absolutely.\" When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department a cancer that is rotten to the root, Biden wouldn't disavow her support and reject her endorsement. He proudly displayed it shortly later on his website. Displayed it in big letters.\nMake no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon.\nNo one will be safe in Biden's America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. [applause]\nEvery day police officers risk their lives to keep us safe. And every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.\nOne of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD, or New York's finest, who I was very, very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. Great, great people. [applause]\nIf they were allowed to do their job. You'd have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy.\nThree years ago on the 4th of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids.\nTwo years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. capitol alongside those beautiful children and held their grandmother's hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored detective Familia's extraordinary life. It was extraordinary.\nDetective Familia's three children are with us this evening, Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much. [applause]\nI promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that's the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. [applause]\nThey are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs. And by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you.\nAnd those who suffer most are the great people who they protect and who they want to protect at an even higher level.\nWhen there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule. [applause]\nIn the strongest possible terms the Republican party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago and New York, many others, Democrat-run.\nThere's violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. Just call, we're ready to go in. We'll take care of your problem in a matter of hours. Just call. We have to wait for the call. It's too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call.\nWe must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, right outside, I signed an order immediately. 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle, it all stopped. No more statues. [laughter]\nThey said, that's just too long, as they looked at a statue. I think we'll rip it down. Then they said 10 years in prison I think that's too long, let's go home.\nDuring their convention Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned.\nNow they're starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. [applause]\nIt's too late, Joe. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago and other cities, Joe Biden's campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it.\nAt least 13 members of Joe Biden's campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters and rioters from jail.\nHere tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters.\nWe're honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann and beloved family members Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. [applause]\nThank you very much. Great man. Great man. As long as I am president, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity and peace.\nIf the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters and flag burners, that is up to them. But I, as your president, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag. [applause]\nLast year over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities.\nJoe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. government, just think of that.\nLiberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent.\nIn every case attacks on American institutions are being waged by radical left.\nAlways remember they're coming after me because I am fighting for you. That's what's happening. [applause]\nAnd it's been going on from before I even got elected. [applause]\nAnd remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. Let's see now what happens. We must reclaim our independence from the Left's repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases. And the ever-more restrictive political decrees.\nMany things have a different name now. And the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society as we know it.\nThe far Left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad. [applause]\nBut on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget. [applause]\nThank you. [Chanting \"four more years\"]\nThank you very much. Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land.\nThey want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds in communities in the best neighborhoods in the world.\nThey want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is I'm here -- [applause] -- what's the name of that building? [applause]\nBut I'll say it differently. The fact is we're here and they're not. [applause]\nTo me one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world, it's not a building, it's a home, as far as I'm concerned. It's not even a house, it's a home. It's a wonderful place, with an incredible history.\nBut it's all because of you. Together we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. [applause]\nThank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our resilience for bad things, we will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We're taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home. [applause]\nWe will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next ten months, and it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens.\n[applause]\nWe will have strong borders. And I've said for years, without borders we don't have a country. Don't have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. [applause]\nWe will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda. [applause] -- which is illegal. We'll ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. [applause]\nAnd if we don't win, your Second Amendment doesn't have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it.\nWe will protect Medicare and Social Security.\nWe will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions. And that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. [applause]\nWe will end surprise medical billing; require price transparency, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. They're coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number one in the world and keep America energy-independent. [applause]\nAnd for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is. You haven't seen that in a long time. [applause]\nWe will win the race to 5G and build the world's best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect -- we will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. [applause]\nAnd we put a very big penalty in -- if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again it's amazing how open they've been lately.\nWe will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars. [applause]\nThis is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology, philosophy or vision than there is right now.\nOur opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. [applause]\nOur country wasn't built by cancel culture, speech codes and soul-crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud and independent American patriots.\nWe're a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down, held back, or in any way reigned in. And we have steel in our spines and grit in their souls and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.\nI want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise, with hard work, devotion and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition.\nOur American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn until dusk. These pioneers didn't have money. They didn't have fame. But they had each other. They loved their families. They loved their country, and they loved their God.\nWhen opportunity beckoned -- [applause] -- they picked up their bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons and set out west for the next adventure.\nRanchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers, they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier.\nLegends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crocket and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon they had churches and communities. Then towns. And with time, great centers of industry and commerce.\nThat is who they were. Americans build their future. We don't tear down our past. We are the nation -- [applause] -- that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature.\nAnd we did it all with style and confidence and flair because that is who we are. Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American liberty.\nThey had no fear, but America didn't stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag, planted on the face of the moon.\nFor America, nothing is impossible. Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show that the world, for America, there is a dream. And it is not beyond your reach.\nTogether we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable, because together we are the proud citizens of the United States of America. [applause]\nAnd on November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before.\nI'm very, very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party. I love you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-republican-presidential-nomination-2"}
{"Title": "Interview with Laura Ingraham of Fox News", "Date": "2020-08-31", "Text": "Thank you.\nWell, these are terrible and very incompetent people. Portland's been burning for many years, for decades it's been burning, but now it's gotten to a point they don't want to do… I watched the Mayor try and get in with these people. And he went to a protest and he went in there. They almost killed him. If he didn't have security, whatever he had, five security guards, he would have been dead, just like they would have done to Rand Paul, who's a great guy, and his wife, Kelly. It is a disgrace. When you look at what's happening. Now, we sent in Homeland Security. The reason we sent them in was to protect our courthouse. We have a $300 million courthouse, and they wanted to blow up our courthouse or burn it down. \"Take your choice, blow it up, or burn it down,\" they said, and I said, \"No, no, that's not happening.\"\nSo they wouldn't protect it, because the Mayor said he doesn't care. So we sent in our Homeland people, they did a great job. Homeland Security. Immediately, it was protected. And that's the only reason they were there. I've offered to send in the National Guard. I've offered to send in anybody they want. I could put that out in 45 minutes and it would stop. And I think the people of Portland and the people of Oregon, I know it's a liberal state, considered liberal. They're tired of it. They're tired of living with this curse. They're living with a curse. They say that when you walk through the streets of Portland, this is years and years of burning and it's not-\nIt's been horrible the last 90 days. But no, it's been going on for many… It's been going on for many, many years. It's like, you're in, I won't name the city, but it's the city someplace in the world that's not so good, okay? It's a terrible situation.\nRight? But they won't ever criticize anybody that truly, that's a violent person, frankly. That's violent. They stick up for the violence. The people that are getting hurt, they don't care about. They don't care about these people. It's a weird thing. It's like warped minds. And for the last 93 days, I've been offering to send in… And as you know, they have to take the offer. They have to ask to have help. I've been standing and I've been saying, \"Anytime you're ready, we'll put it out.\"\nI think it's a sickness, actually. I think they're are also, there's a fear. I watched the way they treated this Mayor Wheeler when he was standing there. And I'll tell you how unfair the news is. NBC news didn't show that he was being shouted at and cursed at. And he ran, literally he had to run for his life, because they were going to really hurt him. He had security. If he didn't, he would have probably-\nHow he can still stick up for them. I think there's a fear. I think he's afraid.\nI don't know. No, I think that like the Mayor Wheeler, I think he's probably afraid for his life. Because if you would have seen him… But I'll show you, had this on NBC news put on and they didn't have the people shouting, they had him standing there, and they talked about how it was a show of great unity. The mayor standing with the people. Those people were going to kill him. They were saying things that I can't repeat right now, but horrible things. But they didn't put that on. I actually happened to see the real tape on Fox. He escaped with his life, and yet he doesn't want any help. It's so unfair to the people of Oregon. We could solve that problem quickly. Like I did in Kenosha. You know, Kenosha went through three or four days of that. You wouldn't have a Kenosha right now. We demanded that they send in the National Guard. Called the governor. And in all fairness, the governor did it. Not enough, but it was enough to put it out. And we ultimately put in where we had 1,000 people and we put it out quickly. You wouldn't have Kenosha right now.\nLook, he's a weak person. He's been weak all his life, but now he's really weak. He shouldn't be running for president. He should not be there.\nNo, I don't want them to. I want to leave it to law enforcement. But my supporters are wonderful, hardworking, tremendous people. And they turn on their television set, and they look at a Portland or they look at a Kenosha before I got involved and stopped it. Or they look at Chicago, where 78 people were shot last week and then numerous people died. Or they look at New York where violence is up by like what, 150%? It's up by a number that nobody… And people are leaving. They're looking at all of this and they can't believe it. They can't believe it. Whether it's my supporter or not.\nWell, it's a peaceful protest. I mean, they were protesting. They weren't… You know, it's amazing. They want to protest and they get criticized. The other people run through the streets, burn down storefronts, hurt people, beat people and kill people, kick people in the face. That would have happened to Rand Paul, by the way, and his wife, except that you had two, and then ultimately four very good policeman, who took a big beating. They took a big beating and they really saved Rand Paul. In fact, we're going to bring them into the white house and give them some kind of an accommodation because they really… What they did was very brave, actually. I mean, can you imagine? I'm saying policemen were brave because they were escorting, but they're escorting a US Senator and his wife. And as Rand said, he would have been killed if they weren't there. It's a terrible-\nSure.\nIt's not only the Democrats, it's the media, the fake news. The news is so fake. Like I told you with the mayor, where they make them look like it's a great unity thing, when actually they were cursing at him and they would have done big numbers on him, but they don't show that. They just show the mayor standing with these very tough thugs and he was gone. Okay? They saved him. But NBC shows it like it's unity with the people. I don't get it. I don't know why they're doing it. And I will say this. At some point I will not be President. Hopefully that'll be in five years from now, but I will not be President. And they're going to die. They're all going to die. Can you imagine if they had to cover sleepy Joe Biden, it won't be very much fun. But much more importantly, our country would go to hell. Our stock markets will crash, as sure as you're sitting there. We will have problems like you've never had. But if you take Kenosha and if you take other parts of the country that I don't even talk about, I could show you things that we've done to stop this kind of a thing that's happening in Portland, and happening in Chicago, and happening in other places.\nSo if it weren't Donald Trump's America, to just use the expression as I'm president, you would have riots like you've never seen. The Democrats have lost control of the radical left. And if you look at Bernie and the, I call it the manifesto that was agreed to with Biden and his crew, that's further left than Bernie ever was. They won't be able to control these people. These people have lost control of these people and it's hurting them. Don't forget, Biden wasn't going to come out of his basement until the election. Now he had to because the polls are so good for me. Now he had two because the polls are different. So all of a sudden he's in Pittsburgh. He wasn't going to leave his basement. Then he said, \"Okay,\" he's leaving. But he won't leave for 10 days. 10 days is a long time. So in the meantime, like on Sunday, or Saturday, I'm in Texas, I'm in Louisiana. I was going to stop in two other places. Fortunately, they didn't get hit. Arkansas wasn't hit very much, et cetera, et cetera. I would have stopped. But I'm all over the place. I leave early in the morning. I get home late at night. And that's what you have to do as president Joe doesn't have energy.\nBecause I am a tremendous fan of law enforcement and I want to thank the law enforcement. They've done a good job. And when the governor says that I shouldn't come or he'd prefer that I not come, I'm the one that called him and said, \"Tony, you got to bring out the National Guard.\" \"Well, I don't really want to do it.\" \"Tony, you got to bring it out.\" And unlike your governor of Oregon, that just keeps saying no, he agreed to it at least. Now he agreed to a small number, but the small number was plenty.\nOh, that's true. That's true. If you look at what's going on in, as you call it, blue state America, blue city America. You look at what's going on in New York. You look at what's going on in these states. Chicago is a disaster. Portland. You look at Portland. Now Portland's a little different. That's anarchists. And I actually think in many ways that's easier to handle. I think Portland is very easy to handle, because that's a group of anarchists that are paid by the outside. And you know, we put a lot of people in jail. I don't know if you know this or not. You remember three, four months ago, we were having a problem with monuments? They were ripping down statues and monuments [crosstalk].\nOh, the Democrats had no control. It actually got out of control even for them. I signed in an executive order, 10 years in jail if you knock down a statue or monument. You haven't heard one thing about it. You haven't. We wouldn't have… They were going after Thomas Jefferson, they were going after Lincoln. And they were going after the Washington monument, that they could knock that one down. They were going after it. And I actually don't even think they know. I think they're just thugs. I don't think it's… It may be an ideology and it may not. It is an ideology for the people that are paying them. And the funny thing is, and the strange thing is, the people that are paying them and all this money, because somebody's doing it [crosstalk] The people paying them, those people will be overthrown. Their lives will be taken away. Their lives will be endangered. They're all going to be gone. They're just stupid foolish people that made a lot of money.\nBecause they're weak people led by weak people. In many cases, not all corporations.\nI looked at numbers where one company is giving hundreds of millions of dollars.\nBecause they just do what's the easiest path. That's not the easy path. That's a very dangerous path. Black Lives Matter is a Marxist organization. You remember pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon. That was the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter. I said, \"That's a terrible name. It's so discriminatory.\" It's bad for black people. It's bad for everybody. And all of a sudden it becomes like, sort of… Although now if you look, it's gone way down, because people are tired of this stuff, what's going on. The Black Lives Matter. If you look at what's going on with the bats and a lot of thugs.\nOh, it's terrible, what's going on. But Black Lives Matter came into existence, walking down the street, screaming, \"Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.\" And that was about police officers that was representing police. They were pigs, pigs in a blanket, like the sausages or hot dogs, fry them like bacon.\nI think even worse, yeah. Probably. [crosstalk] I don't know, do you get worse?\nWe have them all.\nSo they have under investigation a lot. In fact, I'll show you. I just had this, because of this very important interview with you. But I just… And I'll give this to you. In Kansas City, violence has decreased by a third since the initiative began. In Indianapolis, 49 guns confiscated. More than 1000 arrests have been made under the initiative. DOJ is addressing violence and crime across the country. But you don't read that. The FBI and ATF are assisting the Portland police department, but you can't do much when you have absolutely no cooperation.\nBiden won't calm things down. They will take over. They will have won. If Biden gets in, they will have won. He's a weak person. He's controlled like a puppet. So it's not going to be calm things down. It's going to be, they will have won. They will have taken over your cities. It's a revolution. You understand that, it's a revolution. And the people of this country will not stand for that. They're not going to stand for that. The vast majority of people feel like me. They feel like… Every time I put law and order up on social media, it gets such an incredible positive response. The people of this country will not stand for it. If you say calm things down. Yeah. Calm things down, because they will have taken over. Take a look at what's going on. And Biden… Well, Biden is, I don't even like to mention Biden, because he's not controlling anything.\nPeople that you've never heard of. People that are in the dark shadows. People that are-\nPeople that you haven't heard of. There are people that are on the streets. There are people that are controlling the streets. We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend and in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that. They're on a plane.\nI'll tell you sometime, but it's under investigation right now. But they came from a certain city, and this person was coming to the Republican National Convention. And there were like seven people on the plane like this person. And then a lot of people were on the plane to do big damage. They were coming [crosstalk]-\nYeah, this is all happening.\nMoney is coming from some very stupid rich people, that have no idea that if their thing ever succeeded, which it won't, they will be thrown to the wolves like you've never seen before.\nYep.\nWell, that's what they said last time, too.\nOkay. I have to be aggressive because I'm like standing here in a sea of incompetent people, stupid people, and violent people. Very violent.\nThat's okay.\nIt's also the kind, well … Where are we? Oh, we're in the White House. I see. See. Okay? So I'm standing here in a sea of people, and we need law and order in this country, and women see that with me. You're never going to have law and order with Biden. Hey, look at Ferguson. Look what happened during the … You know, people forget. Look at all of those horrible race riots you had during Obama. Ferguson's just one that comes to mind. But you had them all the time. Look at all of what happened with Brown and this one and that one. Look at all of the problems you had under Obama. It was a disaster. It was actually worse than anything.\nThis is a much different situation. Again, the anarchists in Portland are different than what's going on in Chicago. Chicago can be solved. I think it's actually a little bit more difficult to solve. I think the anarchists, in many ways, are much more solvable, but for women, more than anything else, they want security. They want safety. They have to have safety. They talk about the suburban woman. What I did recently, I ended the regulation that provided low-income housing, that mandated low-income housing-\nThat was the Obama rule. It was a disaster.\nOh, yeah. We already- [crosstalk]\nI know the suburbs, look … Westchester was ground zero, okay? For what they were trying to do. They were trying to destroy the suburban, beautiful place. The American dream, really. They wanted low-income housing, and with that comes a lot of other problems, including crime. May not be nice to say, but I'll say it. [crosstalk]\nNo, I'm not saying that at all, but it does … There is a level of violence that you don't see. So you have this beautiful community in the suburbs, including women, right? Women. They want security. I ended where they build low-income housing project right in the middle of your neighborhood. I ended it. If Biden gets in, he already said, it's going to go at a much higher rate than ever before, and you know who's going to be in charge of it? Cory Booker. That's going to be nice. Okay. So I think that women are going to want me, well, for a lot of other reasons. The stock markets will crash. As sure as you're sitting there, your 401(k)s will go down to a small percentage of what they are-\nHe's going to do $4 trillion in tax increases. He's going to do things that are going to cost so much on the Green New Deal, which is done by a child. Okay? That's the mind of a child. Because the Green New Deal is ridiculous. It doesn't work. They're going to do things under the Green … You know, the Green New Deal, if you actually did it, is $100 trillion. That's more money than this country could make in a thousand years-\nLet's rip down a building and build a new one with no windows. Okay?\nI've done criminal justice reform. I saved the historically black colleges and universities. What they went through was, for years, including Obama-\nPrison reform, criminal justice reform.\nOpportunity zone. More of the same. And in fact, I actually said in the speech, the best is yet to come. And I've been treated very well, at least in the polls, I hope. I hope that translates because, unfortunately, the African American, the Black community, has been so used to going and pressing the Democrat lever, and what have they got out of it? They've got nothing. Obama didn't give them criminal justice reform. I did. Obama didn't give them opportunity zones. I did. Obama didn't do all of the things, didn't save … Obama could have saved the historically black colleges and universities. He didn't do anything for them. He didn't do anything for them. I've done more.\nAnd I said in the speech, some people would say, you shouldn't say it. It's too aggressive. I said, what's aggressive? I've done more than any president in the United … in the history of our country, except for maybe Abe, and I say maybe, maybe, Abraham Lincoln. The reason I say maybe is I'll explain that to you later. Okay?\nWait a minute. I've done more for the Black community than any president in the United States with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. And it's true. Criminal justice reform was such a big deal, and look what Biden did in 1994, what he did to people, to Black people.\nWell, he called them predators.\nSuper predators, actually. He called them super predators.\nWhat the Black community wants in this country is they want police, and they want law and order. They don't want what's happening to their communities. They're being affected in a much harsher, meaner matter than anybody else. That includes Hispanics, who aren't doing very well, also. Look, they want law and order. They want the police. They do polls, and the polls are at 82, 83%. They want the police. They've gotten along with the police, and the police have been very badly mistreated because you have one bad apple, and it becomes a story for weeks.\nOh, yeah. Dorn-\nYeah, that's true. Yeah. That's true. Killed.\nThe police are under siege because of things … They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do. And one bad apple, or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke. Shooting the guy.\nShooting the guy in the back many times. I mean, couldn't you have done something different? Couldn't you have wrestled him? In the meantime, he might've been going for a weapon, and there's a whole big thing there. But they choke. Just like in a golf tournament, they miss a three-foot-\nI'm saying people choke.\nPeople choke, and people are bad people. You have both. You have some bad people, and you have, they choke. You could be a police officer for 15 years, and all of a sudden you're confronted. You've got a quarter of a second to make a decision. If you don't make the decision and you're wrong, you're dead. People choke under those circumstances, and they make a bad decision. I've seen bad decisions of people that, it looked bad, but probably it was a choke. But you also have bad police, but you also … The vast, not only the vast majority, thousands and thousands of great acts, and one bad one, and you make the evening news for weeks.\nThe call is being made, as I understand it, yes.\nWell, once you get to a certain number, we use the word herd, right? Once you get to a certain number, it's going to go away. So, it doesn't have to be. But yeah, I mean, a lot of people are not going to want to do it. A lot of people don't want to do the flu vaccine.\nYou know, I never had the flu, but I never had a shot. I never had the vaccine. I come here, the first thing is, sir, you have to have a flu shot. I said, \"Why?\" \"Because you have to have it.\" I say, \"What's the percentage? And I wasn't thrilled with the percentage, it's like 50%, 55%.\"\nWell, I said, look, if I've never had it, wouldn't it be good? And then I thought I should have it because I'll set an example. So I had it. So I've had it now three times, and I still haven't had the flu. So maybe I'll give credit to the flu vaccine. I don't know.\nIf I can say this. I think we're going to have a vaccine very soon. A lot of tremendous work has been done. We're going to have a vaccine, just like we have therapeutics, which to me are even more important. You go into the hospital, you make people better. That's to me the most, and we just did the convalescent plasma, I think. And you have other things too. So I think we're going to have a lot of therapeutics and we're going to have a vaccine very soon as to whether or not people take it-\nYou add 35 to the people that have had it. And to all of the other things. People that have had it, where in theory, you can't get it, although they found one person and they're making a big deal. One person got it twice. But if you add it all up, it gives you very good protection.\nYeah.\nWell, I think it's a very dangerous statement for him to make. Look, we did the right thing. We shut it down and now we built it up and we're setting records on job numbers. We're setting records on retail numbers. So this guy comes in, I heard it the other day, if they said, so that means that if some doctor said we have to shut it down, we're going to shut it down. We're setting records. By the way, the stock market is at an all time record right now. You look at what's going on in the stock market. Look at what's going on. We're going to have a phenomenal year, next year. We're going to have a great third quarter. Interestingly, the numbers for the third quarter will come out before the election.\nSo what happens- [crosstalk].\nWell, I can tell you what is happening. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to give any stimulus. We should have it. It wasn't the people's fault that China gave us this virus. China gave us the virus. Whether it was through incompetence or on purpose.\nWell, I always tell her to go back to San Francisco, take care of your homeless problem. Take care of your problem in California. Because there's nothing like what I'm witnessing out there. Right outside, right where she lives right in her district is so bad. Needles all over the place-\nWell, we should have. We'd like to get it for the people because it wasn't their fault, but she doesn't want to give it because that will make the economy a little bit better and that would be a terrible thing.\nI get along with him very well. I disagree with a lot of what he said. He said, \"Keep it open for China.\" That was a big mistake, and he admits it. I get along with him, but every once in a while, he'll come up with one that I say, \"Where did that come from?\" I inherited him. He was here. He was a part of this huge piece of machine. I didn't put anybody in charge. He was here. He's been here for 40 years.\nOkay. He's been here for many, many years, but you inherit a lot of people. It's part of the machinery and you have some you love, some you don't. I like him, I don't agree with him that often, but I like him.\nYeah.\nIt's been different because I've accomplished so much. On the military, I've accomplished, first of all I'm bring in many of the troops home and most of the troops home, even cutting down Germany. Okay? Because they've taken advantage of us like you wouldn't believe. But it's been different for a lot of different", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-laura-ingraham-fox-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-08-31", "Text": "Thank you very much. I'd like to begin by saying we've just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market—Dow—in 36 years. That's very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401(k)s and with the stocks that they have. And that's a tremendous achievement: best in 36 years.\nLet me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38 percent. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid, point-of-care tests. These tests return the results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We're being focusing—we're focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high-risk populations. So we're going to have the 15-minute, and less, tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point-of-care tests. That's something.\nThis evening I am pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials. So that's joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and, hopefully, approval. In the United States, we're doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months. Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time.\nI also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we're seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, Federal law enforcement is working with State and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists, and bring them to justice. We've just come up with a report that we've arrested a large number of people. It's over 200. And you'll be hearing about that, but they've been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We're doing it very low key, but we're trying to help cities. They are, in all cases, Democrat-run, but we're doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent.\nWe'd like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately 1 hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don't know why it's good for him to have a city that's falling apart and that's under siege now for 94 days. But, really, it's been under siege for years, if you know Portland.\nSo, to the mayor, I say: Whenever you're ready, let us know. We'll solve your problem of violence. We'll solve your problem of crime. We'll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you'll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland.\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent, left-wing civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the Federal Government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters, just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we've seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Biden—Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats; it's Democrat-run cities, and it's a shame, and it can be solved so easy. It can be solved very easily.\nThe violence is fueled by dangerous rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our Nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they're very good at doing. We've taken that power away. They're afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They're afraid to be destroyed.\nYou saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife Kelley. What they went through, but other people went through it too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is, the public is very wise to it. They see what's happening, and they're wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly.\nLeft-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about, the—really, you hear this from people—what they're saying, how they're saying it—the violence, it's terrible. And again, it's Democrat politicians. I don't know that they're spurring it on, or they're afraid to stop it. But in any event, we're there to help. We're there to get things under control.\nWhat they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It's a disgrace. And frankly, the mayor—Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser—should have done a better job. She did a very poor job. But at the same time, we had the police, who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess, it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down, and—but got right up, and two others joined them, and they were able to get Rand and Kelley through.\nBut it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar—not to the extent, in terms of taping. We don't have to the tapes as strong, but some people went through—from what I heard—as bad, or worse.\nThe violent rioters share Biden's same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our Nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, he didn't mention the fact, and he didn't mention the far left. He didn't mention the far left, or, from what I saw, I don't believe he mentioned the word \"Antifa.\" Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn't mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement.\nHe went on, point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn't talk about those on the left. And those on the left are the problem, and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side: They're both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious.\nAnd until that neutralizes, you're never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas. For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals repeating the monstrous lie that these were peaceful protests. They're not peaceful protests. That's anarchy. That's—you look at the agitators, you look at the looters, you look at the rioters—that's not a peaceful protest.\nThey keep using the term—it's so nice—\"peaceful protest.\" And behind the reporter, the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I'll be going tomorrow. And at least, the Governor asked me if I could, we would—I said, \"You've got to get the National Guard.\" And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things, and that was about 5 days ago, 6 days ago. And ever since, it's been very good.\nThirteen members of Biden's campaign staff donated to bail and—rioters—they're getting them out of jail. Looters—they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It's outrageous that they're now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem. And they really want to put it on the backs of the police. I see it. The police are—there's just a war on law enforcement in this country. And without law enforcement, we wouldn't have a country. We have very talented people; they're not allowed to do their job.\nIf you give the radical left power, what you're seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they've had such problems.\nTo defeat them, we must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting. And that's what we want to do.\nThey want to destroy our country. They're going to destroy our suburbs. But I think I've gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration; they were going to be made much worse.\nWhat we're witnessing today is a result of left-wing indoctrination in our Nation's schools and universities. Many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism. Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn't even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren't mentioned.\nTwo words that were taken out were the words \"under God\"—\"under God\"—two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance. In their caucus, I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said: \"That's strange. What's—that's a big\"—I tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn't make a mistake. Then, they did it later on.\nSo they took the word—essentially, took the word \"God\" out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We're not taking the word \"God\" out of anything. We're not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we're not taking the great word \"God\" out of anything.\nAt our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left's war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it's good, but it's gotten out of control. They're unable to control this radical-left, crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly—very, very, quickly indeed.\nThe only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our Nation's schools, where they're trying to change everything that we've learned. What we've learned—in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason—cancel culture—whatever you want to call it.\nAt the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance—zero—for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the U.S. population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated.\nBiden won't even say the name \"Antifa.\" I don't believe he said it today. He made a speech, and he didn't mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn't mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement, he mentioned the police, and—but he didn't mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there's no way that he'll solve the problem. You don't name it, you don't solve it.\nIn fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants: the far-left policy agenda it's asking for. And if that happened, we don't have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn't go away; they gain new power to spread the terror nationwide.\nMost of our Nation is extremely safe, by the way. You know, you only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago, and you see what's happened in New York just in a very short period of time. It's horrible what's happened in New York. I love New York; I come from New York. And when I see—4 years ago, I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He's terrible mayor; one of the worst. I can't say \"the worst.\" I mean, I've witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he's certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what's happening in New York, and I look at what's happening in the city, and—so quickly. It happened so quickly. It's a shame.\nBiden's strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he's doing—I don't think he even knows what he's doing—and give them control over every lever of power in the United States Government. But when you surrender to the mob, you don't get freedom, you get fascism. That's what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what—look what's going on there and other places.\nBiden is using mafia talking points: \"The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want.\" That's what it is. \"The mob will leave you alone. Give them what you want.\" But it doesn't work that way, because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking.\nWhat happens is, you give and give and give, and you take, and they no longer respect you. And that's what's happened with the Democrats, because I actually think they've lost control of these radical-left maniacs. I think they've lost control, because I don't think they feel that's helping them—when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland, and you look at Baltimore, and you look at so many different places and what's going on there. The top 10 are all run by Democrats, and you can go a lot further down the list than 10.\nIn America, we will never surrender to mob rule, because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we're continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don't even think about it. They wake up the next morning; they don't even think about it.\nThis is the extreme left's agenda for America: They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and Federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers.\nNo one will be safe. And, in fact, they want very much to let people in prison—like, as an example, the Boston bomber—they want to let everybody vote. If you're in prison, if you're the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don't know, I don't think that sells too well.\nMy administration is a very different approach. We want States to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard. We're prepared. We're ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country—East Coast, West Coast, doesn't matter—we're ready to move immediately, as we did in Minneapolis, as we did—we are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine. Tomorrow I'm going to a place where we moved very quickly—you know that—in Wisconsin. And we moved very, very quickly. And as soon as we moved, that was the end of that. It was very well behaved.\nI'll appoint more tough-on-crime prosecutors, support stiffer penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows. And we need order. We need order. You can't have cities run like these cities are run.\nThey gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more. And all of a sudden, they've lost these cities, but I'll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, \"Please come in.\" As you know, they have to ask—unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don't like to do that—they have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we'll be there within a matter of minutes.\nWhen I signed the Executive order outlining 10-year prison sentences, as an example, for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was 3 months ago or so. I signed an order, and it said, \"Ten years in prison.\" Ten years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge, I haven't seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They canceled that march. They said 10 years is too long.\nBefore the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime. In the last 2 years of the Obama administration, murder increased 30 percent in major American cities, and we witnessed the largest 2-year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century.\nIn the first 2 years of my Presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation LeGend, surging Federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. And we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot.\nSince the beginning of Operation LeGend, we have conducted more than 1,000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third; got it down 33 percent. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don't know that, but we sent them into Chicago without fanfare at all. But we cut it down in half; it's still far too high. And if they'd ask for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we'd be able to cut it down to a very low number.\nWhile I am President, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe. And we do—we honor our police; we honor our law enforcement.\nI have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of—the sheriffs in Florida—all of them; law enforcement, Ohio, in Texas, North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I've gotten all of it. We'll have to do a little study so I'm totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn't, I think we have to look at them, where do they come from.\nSo we've done a real job. We're ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don't even have to put it in writing. We'll put it in writing later. We'll get them in there, and we'll straighten out the city very quickly, whichever city we may be talking about. So those Governors that are responsible for a State that has a city that's got a lot of problems: Call me or the mayor can call me, and we'll be there very quickly.\nTomorrow we're making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we're proud of it, because, in 6 days, it's been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately.\nOkay, please. Thank you.\nNo, because Kenosha was something we did a good job on. The Governor didn't want us there. He didn't want the National Guard, as you know. He was very reluctant. But I give him credit because, ultimately, he said yes. And as soon as he said yes, the problem ended.\nBut I have to see the people that did such a good job for me. And we're meeting with numerous people. And we have tremendous support in the State of Wisconsin. So I promised them, when it all gets taken care of, we'll go.\nWell, it could also increase enthusiasm, and it could increase love and respect for our country. And that's why I'm going, because they did a fantastic job. As soon as I called and told them, \"Let's go,\" the whole problem stopped. That was—what?—6 days ago.\nYes, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].\nShooting of Jacob Blake, Jr., by Police in Kenosha, Wisconsin\nWell, I spoke with the pastor—a wonderful man—the family's pastor. And I thought it would be better not to do anything where there are lawyers involved. They wanted me to speak, but they wanted to have lawyers involved, and I thought that was inappropriate, so I didn't do that. But I did speak with the pastor of the family, who is a fine man, a wonderful man. And I think we had a great talk.\nAnd I may, at some point, you know, do that. But they did have a lawyer that wanted to be on the phone, and I said, \"No, that's inappropriate,\" but I just gave my best regards. But, again, I spoke with the pastor.\nYes, please.\nYes.\nWell, I understand they had large numbers of people that were supporters, but that was a peaceful protest. And paint is not—and paint is a defensive mechanism; paint is not bullets.\nYour supporters—your supporters—and they are your supporters, indeed—shot a young gentleman who—and killed him—not with paint, but with a bullet. And I think it's disgraceful.\nThese people, they protested peacefully. They went in very peacefully. And I'll tell you what they're protesting: They're protesting, when they turn on television or read whatever they may be reading, and they see a city like Chicago, where 78 people were shot and 13 died; or a city like New York, where the crime rate has gone through the roof; or a city like Portland, where the entire city is ablaze all the time, and a mayor says, \"We don't want any help from the Federal Government.\"\nWhen these people turn that on and they see that, they say: \"This is not our country. This is not our country.\" That was a peaceful protest, totally.\nOkay, go ahead, please.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nGo ahead, please.\nExcuse me?\nExcuse me?\nWe're looking at all of it. And that was an interesting situation. You saw the same tape as I saw. And he was trying to get away from them, I guess; it looks like. And he fell, and then they very violently attacked him. And it was something that we're looking at right now, and it's under investigation.\nBut I guess he was in very big trouble. He would have been—I—he probably would have been killed.\nIt's under—it's under investigation.\nI'd like to see law enforcement take care of everything. I think everything should be taken care of—law enforcement.\nBut again, we have to give our cops back, our police back their dignity, their respect. They're very talented people. They're strong. They're tough. They can do the job, but we've taken it away. We don't want to have—when somebody makes a mistake, he chokes, or—in some cases, you have bad cops, and we have to take care of that.\nIn other cases, they choke. They're under—they have a quarter of a second—a quarter of a second to make a decision, and sometimes, they make the wrong decision. If they make the wrong decision—you know, if they make the wrong decision in the other direction, they're probably dead. So they choke sometimes, and that goes on the evening news for weeks.\nAnd the thousands and tens of thousands of great things they do, nobody covers that. Nobody writes about that. But if they make a mistake——\nAnd again, the bad cops—everybody agrees they have to be very tough on bad cops. But sometimes you have a cop or a police person who is a good—a good police person, right? Good. But they choke. You know, the timing—and they go through this, and they study this, and they work on it all the time. They literally have a quarter of a second to make some of these decisions. And they make a wrong decision, and it's very devastating.\nBut I will say this: I honor law enforcement. We wouldn't be here right now if it wasn't for law enforcement. We have to stop this horrible, left-wing ideology that seems to be permeating our country. And basically, it's weakness. It's weakness on behalf of Democrat politicians.\nThe Republicans, we don't have problems. You take a look at our cities; our cities are doing very well. They're safe. They're secure. I spent a lot of time in Texas, as you know, just a couple of days ago. And I was with the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott. He was explaining they wouldn't put up with it for a minute. They just don't have the kind of problems that other people have.\nThank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1257"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-04", "Text": "Thank you, everybody, very much. Thank you. So, as we begin Labor Day weekend, America's unprecedented economic recovery continues. You see what's going on. It's been pretty amazing. The United States economy added today—announced this morning—1.4 million jobs last month, bringing the total to over 10.6 million jobs created in just 4 months. That's a record, by far.\nIn August, we added 249,000 retail jobs; 174,000 leisure and hospitality jobs; and 29,000 new manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate plummeted to 8.4 percent, the second largest single-month drop ever recorded, surpassed only by our big decline in June.\nLast month, we saw large declines in the unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans—very big declines. We're witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from any economic crisis in history, by far. By contrast, the last administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history. That was well documented, as you know.\nThis year, the United States has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western Nation, and we are recovering at a much faster rate than any other nation. Business confidence is higher today in America than in any other G-7 or EU country—that covers a lot of territory. So we have the business confidence is higher than many—than any of those countries.\nIn July, retail sales not only recovered, but reached a new alltime high. So think of that: retail sales. That's a very basic statistic, and it's a big statistic. It not only recovered, but reached the highest level ever. Auto sales have surged to an incredible 74 percent since their April low and are nearly back to their previrus levels. And that's been a tremendous thing. Used cars and new cars have been both doing incredibly well.\nMortgage applications were 27-percent higher in August than during the same period last year. Homebuilder sentiment reached the highest level on record, indicating that more high-paying construction jobs are on the way. Homebuilding has been great, and lending has been really incredible. U.S. manufacturing activity reached a 19-month high in August.\nWhile my administration has fought every day to restore prosperity, however, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are holding additional China virus relief hostage to reasons that nobody understands. I guess I do; I think I understand. It's called politics.\nAnd speaking of politics, I think North Carolina, I think that Michigan and Pennsylvania and other States, they should open. The Governors—the Democrat Governors—should open their States. They'll open them on November 4. But they should open them now. It's very unfair to the people to have those shutdowns continuing at the level that they're continuing.\nDemocrats are insisting on a massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue States, stimulus checks for illegal aliens, and the mass release of inmates from jail. They want to release a lot of inmates, some of them for very serious reasons. They want to release them from jail. They want that part—as part of a stimulus package, can you believe it?\nIt's time for the Democrats in Congress to start working across the aisle and put the American people first. Now, we have $300 billion in an account that we didn't use—$300 billion. And we are willing to use that. I would be willing to release it, subject to Congress, and use that as stimulus money, and it would go right to the American people. So we have $300 billion sitting in an account that we didn't need because things are going so well with the economy.\nBut it would be a very appropriate thing to release that to the American people, and I am willing to do it; all we need is a signoff. But that doesn't mean that we're going to release prisoners. Some prisoners—some very vicious people, actually. We're not going to put them on the streets like the Democrats want us to, and we're not going to give stimulus checks to illegal aliens. They came into the country illegally, and now we give them a check? We want to give the checks to the American people.\nSo, remember, we have $300 million [billion]*; it's there. We don't need the money. We don't need anything. Just let that money get released to the American people.\nAs our economy rebounds, there's only one thing that could stop the extraordinary economic comeback and wipe out the future of American workers—and that's what the Democrats want to do with a $4 trillion tax hike—implementing things that will be really bad for our country. And this will just absolutely cripple what we're doing on regulations and so many other elements of success.\nWe had the greatest economy in history, prior to the China virus coming in. Now they want to stop regulations. They want to bring up regulations to a level—stop the things that we're doing, which are at a much smaller level, and bring up regulations at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\nThey want to do things that will make it impossible for any economy to grow. They want to ban fracking. And as you saw—ban, ban, ban. And all of a sudden, he sees his polls going down, and now he says, \"Well, I was only talking about not maybe banning fracking,\" but he wants to ban fracking.\nAnd it doesn't matter what he wants to ban; the people that control him want to ban fracking. And whether it's Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota—so many other States—you can't ban fracking. That would be a disaster—Ohio. They want to abolish American energy—I mean, that's what's going to happen—adopt disastrous trade deals, and inflict a devastating shutdown.\nAs you know, he said we want to shut it down: \"We would be willing to shut it down.\" And you don't shut down when we're setting records. And by the way, we're rounding the corner. We're rounding the corner on the virus.\nJoe Biden's blanket shutdown would collapse our economy. It would cause countless deaths from suicide, drug, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and more. You know, shutdowns cause a lot of problems—a lot of very serious problems—more so than the virus itself. Biden's plan is not a solution, it's a virtual surrender.\nAnd our country is doing so well. We're starting to do so well. I think we're going to have a great third quarter. I mean, you're going to see for yourself, because the numbers will be announced sometime prior to the election on November 3.\nAnd as you know, Joe spent his entire career sending American jobs to China and other faraway countries. For 47 years, people were pillaging our country: taking our jobs, taking our companies. And that's never going to change with that mindset and with that group. Biden is not going to be standing up to these foreign countries. He's not going to be standing up—maybe more importantly—to the people that run the Democrat Party. He doesn't have the strength to do that.\nHe refuses even to condemn Antifa, a bad group, a far-left domestic terrorist organization. He doesn't want to say anything bad about it. His plan to appease to the domestic terrorists is the exact opposite of what I'm doing now. And I think you saw that last night.\nYesterday the U.S. Marshals—we sent them in. U.S. Marshals. We were waiting for local government to take care of it, but they didn't do that, so the U.S. Marshals went in—law enforcement. They took down the Antifa member who murdered a man in the middle of a street in Portland. The suspect was killed after drawing a weapon, when officers attempted to take him into custody. They wanted to take him in—the U.S. Marshals, incredible people.\nSo I want to thank them for their strength, their bravery. And I really do wish that the mayor of Portland and the Governor of Oregon would get going and stop the crime in that city. It'd be so easy to do.\nWhile we're focused on creating good-paying jobs, the radical left is focused on unleashing really violent mobs. And you see that. Whether you're conservative or liberal; Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we must all agree the need for peace and order and safety.\nUnder my administration, law enforcement is conducting arrests nationwide of rioters, looters, and domestic terrorists. The reason we didn't put Chicago into our list—where we're holding back funds from some of these States and cities that are doing such a poor job, such an incompetent job—a job that nobody can even imagine how bad. And we're holding it back until they get their act together.\nAnd we are having a lot of people in Chicago right now, and you notice that their numbers are going down rapidly. But we have—we've deployed a lot of Federal law enforcement inside of Chicago, and they're taking out quite a few people. And they're being arrested; they're being put in jail. And that's why you see those numbers going down. That's why you see that, with respect to the mayor, we did not hold back funds in Chicago.\nBut New York is experiencing a tremendous crime wave, in some cases, up over 300 percent. And they have to do something quickly.\nWe just spoke to Mayor Bowser, and she's willing to do whatever is necessary. We had a very good talk with her. That's in DC.\nAnd the other places, they speak for themselves.\nWe're working with the State and local authorities to comb through hours of videotape, identifying arrest suspects; and prosecute lawbreakers. We've already got over 300 in jail, and we have tremendous evidence.\nAnd I want to thank the media for helping us out, because they're taking different angles—we have it from every different angle. You can't probably have any better than what we've got. We see it from the sky and the ground and from the right and from the left. So when they say they didn't do it, we say, \"Well, what's this?\" So we get that from the media, free of charge.\nUnder Operation LeGend, we've surged Federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. The initiative has already resulted in tremendous success. And nationwide, we have over 2,000 arrests. And we don't talk about it too much, but now we might as well. So we've arrested over 2,000 criminals. They're criminals. And in a single month, murder rate in Chicago—as you know, and as I said—it was cut in half, actually.\nSo, on the China virus front, the nations of Europe have experienced a 38-percent greater excess mortality than the United States—38-percent more—greater—excess mortality than the United States. A lot of you don't want to report that. And if we took New York into the—out of the equation, there's nobody even close. The job we've done is incredible. And we don't get any credit for it, but we've done an incredible job.\nThrough Operation Warp Speed, we have three vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials. Yesterday Pfizer announced—I just spoke to the head of Pfizer, great guy—they announced that it expects to have the results of its trial very, very shortly—next month—but very shortly.\nWe remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1. We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October. And Pfizer is among the leaders, as you know, and it's a great company. Johnson and Johnson also doing very well. Moderna. We have some really great companies. They're all doing very well. They're all in final stages, and I think you're going to see results that are shockingly good.\nFinally, I want to provide you with a brief update of the virus. Cases in the United States have declined 28 percent nationwide over the last month, and hospitalizations and deaths have continued to decline over the past week—very substantially decline.\nThanks to America's medical genius, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85 percent in April. Mortality rate reduced by 85 percent. Hospital lengths of stay are one-third of their average length in April. So the hospitalization is down. The length of stay is way down.\nIn order to keep making progress against the virus, we ask all Americans to remain vigilant, especially over Labor Day. You know, you have the Labor Day weekend coming upon us immediately—I guess we can say—pretty immediately. And we need everybody to be careful, to apply common sense, and do all of the things that we've told you to do as quickly—as much as you can—social distancing, wearing a mask whenever the distancing is not possible, and staying like—staying with a group that you know.\nLet's just try and get through this one weekend, and I think we have a chance of doing that. Just social distance, wash your hands—all of the hygiene things that we speak about. And we're really rounding the turn.\nAnd the vaccines are coming. The therapeutics have already come, but they continue to come. The convalescent plasma has had a tremendous impact already; you see what's happening there. And remdesivir has been incredible.\nSo we have a lot of things happening. We have a lot of therapeutics coming out. I think—from the standpoint of common sense, I guess, therapeutics, to me—right now you go into a hospital, you give somebody a shot or a transfusion. It might be a transfusion; probably more than 50 percent are actually transfusions. And they'll leave the hospital shortly thereafter. I mean, to me, that's more important, in a certain sense, than the vaccine. But the vaccines will be great over the long term; the therapeutics over the short term.\nAnd also knowing you have the therapeutics, I think, is great from the standpoint of mind—from the standpoint of the mind. That's great.\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. I'm going to ask Larry Kudlow to give a couple of examples of how strong our economy is recovering, how strongly it's recovering. And it's setting records at every level, and we're doing better than every other country. And we're very proud of all of the people for doing such an incredible job. This is a \"V.\" It's a \"super V.\"\nAgain, we have $300 billion ready to go. All Congress has to do is say, \"Use it.\" If they say, \"Use it\"—I'd like to use it without their permission, but I guess I'm not allowed to do that. I did ask that question. So Congress has to just say, \"Use it.\" All they have to do is say, \"Use it\"; $300 billion gets immediately put into our system and will really help the American people. There's nothing else to do—just a very quick statement. So I'm going to ask Larry to come up. I want to thank another man for being here today. There's a man that's a incredible leader: Lou Holtz. I've known him for a long time. He's been a friend of mine. And I think I've received letters from every football coach, almost, in the Nation. And that's a little exaggeration, but some of the greats. Nick Saban wrote a letter. Coach O—and Coach O is central casting. I said, \"We're going to have to put him in a movie\"—right?—\"as a football coach.\" He'd really be good playing a football coach like you. And Urban Meyer wrote a beautiful letter. And so many of the other great, legendary coaches.\nNot only coaches though—people in sports and people in life and even great political people, recommending Lou for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we've analyzed it very closely. We've looked at all of those recommendations. We've looked at Lou's life and his career and what he's done for charity. And the football is obvious—he was a great coach—but what he's done, beyond even coaching.\nSo Lou will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And a date is being picked; it won't be in the too-distant future. Lou was married to a great woman. Right, Lou? A great woman. And she just passed away a few months ago. This is an incredible woman. She was stronger—I knew her; I knew her well—she was stronger than Lou. [Laughter] I think she was stronger than you, Lou, I hate to tell you. You're strong, too. But she was special, right?\nSo I just want to congratulate Coach Lou Holtz on—soon to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we look forward to that, Lou. Thank you very much. And you can stay around and listen to Larry for a couple of seconds or——\nFormer college football coach Louis L. Holtz. I listen to Larry——\n——or go to your friend.\nYou probably know half of the people in the room. I'll bet they treat you better than they treat me. They treat him good. I wish you'd treat me that way.\nLarry, come on up.\nThank you, Larry, very much.\nOkay, please.\nYes.\nYes. What about it?\nWell, I am. You know, there's a theory that I can do it without the approval, but I'd rather get the approval so that we have it. But there's a theory I could take the $300 billion. It's money that we have—money that we built up and money that we haven't spent, and I would love to give it to the American people as a very powerful stimulus. So yes.\nI think there is a theory that I could do it without having to go back, but I think it would be appropriate to go back, and I would ask Congress to approve it. It's a very simple approval. It's—literally, it's a one-sentence approval, and the Democrats should do that. The Republicans will do that. They would be glad to do that. So we'll see whether or not they do it. Okay?\nPlease, in the back.\nRight.\nWell, I'm honored that Delaware—because I don't see Biden anywhere but Delaware. He's—and I like Delaware too. But to have the law enforcement in Delaware give their endorsement to me is really a great honor. It's really—it just shows you how pathetic the Democrats are when it comes to crime, when it comes to law and order.\nSo would you please extend my very great thanks? That's a great honor to get it from Delaware law enforcement. We've gotten it from almost all law enforcement, but that's—that's a—because every time I see Biden speak, it says, \"Delaware, Delaware, Delaware.\" He never leaves. I'm all over the country; I'm all over the place.\nYes, please. Go ahead. Did you have? Yes, go ahead, Jeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters].\nRussia of the Future Opposition Party Leader Alexei Navalny/Russia-U.S. Relations/The President's Foreign Policy Record/Coronavirus Outbreak in China\nWell, I think we have to look at it very seriously if that's the case, and I think we will. There's nobody been tougher on Russia than I have. We get along. I get along with almost all countries.\nI get along with North Korea. Remember? We were supposed to be going to war with North Korea. If Hillary got elected, you'd be at war right now with North Korea. That would be a very messy war, a very bad war. Many millions of people would be killed. In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I'd be at war in 1 week; it's been just the opposite.\nWe're doing very well in Afghanistan, bringing the troops down—very low level—and other things are happening. Very interestingly, we have a great peace deal going on in the Middle East, actually, with U.A.E. and Israel. And that's been received like, probably, very few things that many people have done. It's been very well received. And we'll be having other countries announcing soon; they're joining that, and you're going to have a lot of countries in that. A lot of countries are saying, \"Hey, why didn't you bring us in right from the beginning?\" They would have loved to have been there, but they want to be in.\nSo we're doing a lot of things. I think that I was the one that alerted the United States and the world: Nord Stream 2. I said: \"Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars to Russia to get their energy from Russia, and then we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia? What's that all about?\" And the sanctions and everything else.\nAt the same time, with Russia, we're right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It's a very important thing. To me, it's the most important thing. Some people say \"global warming;\" I don't. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest; they are the second biggest, nuclear-wise. China is third. They're actually a distant third, but they're building pretty rapidly. And at some point, we'll include China into those talks, but we're doing very well with Russia on nuclear nonproliferation.\nSo I don't know exactly what happened. I think it's tragic. It's terrible. It shouldn't happen. We haven't had any proof yet, but I will take a look.\nIt is interesting that everybody is always mentioning Russia. And I don't mind you mentioning Russia, but I think probably China, at this point, is a nation that you should be talking about much more so than Russia because the things that China is doing are far worse, if you take a look at what's happening with the world.\nLook at what happened with the China virus. Look at what they did by not keeping that within the confines of China. They should have kept it in the confines of China. Look what they've done to 188 countries all over the world. But you never ask about China; you're always asking about Russia.\nSo I would be very angry if that's the case, and we'll take a look at the numbers and the documents, because we're going to be sent a lot of documents over the next few days.\nNot—please, in the back.\nIndia-U.S. Relations/India-China Relations\nThank you.\nWell, I didn't understand everything you said. I know India, and I understood—those young people that you mentioned. They're very good, young people. And I know their relationship to India is very good, and so is mine.\nAnd Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine, and he's doing a very good job. Nothing easy—nothing easy, but he's doing a very good job.\nWe're talking—I mean, while we're at it, we're talking about China and India. They're pretty—going at a pretty good on the border, as you know. It's been very nasty. It's been a very nasty situation, and we stand ready to help, with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help, and we are talking to both countries about that.\nBut I appreciate your nice sentiments. They think a lot of India, and so do I. And I think a lot of your Prime Minister. Thank you.\nI do. We had a—an event in Houston, as you know, and it was a fantastic event. I was invited by Prime Minister Modi. And this was a massive—this was at the—where they play football—the Houston football team. And it was incredible. It was actually incredible. And the Prime Minister could not have been more generous.\nWe have great support from India. We have great support from Prime Minister Modi. And I would think that the people—Indian people—would be voting for Trump. I also, as you know, went to India, just prior to the pandemic setting in, because India has been hit very hard. Left, really, about a week before that.\nAnd we had an incredible time. What— we saw—the people are so incredible. It's really an incredible place, an incredible country, and it's definitely big. It's definitely big.\nBut you've got a great leader, and he's a great, great person.\nI hope not. I hope not, but they're certainly going at it. They're going at it much more strongly than a lot of people even understand.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nGo ahead, please.\nRussia of the Future Opposition Party Leader Alexei Navalny/Russia-U.S. Relations/Coronavirus Outbreak in China\nNo, I don't. I mean, I don't. I hear Germany has made a—was it definitive, or almost definitive? But we have not seen it ourselves, no. But we have not seen it ourselves.\nBut I would certainly be okay with that. They want to do something. They want to take action. Shouldn't happen. Shouldn't happen.\nBut again, we are working very closely with a lot of countries on a lot of different things. We've taken stronger action against Russia than any other country in the world, as you know. I'll tell you, President Putin would tell you that right now.\nBut the fact that I—the fact that I get along with Russia and that I get along, frankly, with everybody—right now, I'm not getting along with China, but that's my choice. I don't like what happened with respect to the pandemic, with respect to the China virus. I don't like it at all. What they've done to this world and this country and Europe and everyplace else is terrible.\nBut I do get along with—with President Putin. But I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, by far.\nIf you look at the Obama administration, they were weak. Look at the land they gave up. Look at what happened with respect to—look at what happened with respect to Ukraine. Such a big part of Ukraine given up during the Obama administration. And I don't think they would have done that with me. I don't think they would have done that with me at all.\nWe gave tank busters, and they gave pillows. Do you ever hear that expression? They sent pillows, and we sent tank busters to Ukraine.\nSo—but with that being said, if we can do a nuclear nonproliferation agreement, that would be a great thing. No, but I would not be at all happy if that were the case. And it looks like it might very well be the case. I mean, based on what Germany——\n——based on what Germany is saying, that seems to be the case.\nJon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].\nI—look, I say what I say. And I never got along with John McCain. I disagreed with John McCain. You know that better than anybody, frankly. I wasn't a fan. I disagreed with many of his views. I disagreed with his views on these ridiculous, endless wars. I disagreed with the way he handled the vets, the VA. The VA is running much better now—and we did with the MISSION Act and the accountability and all the things we've done for the VA. He was not able to do that.\nBut I disagreed with John McCain on a lot of things. That doesn't mean I don't respect him. I respected him, but I really disagreed with him on a lot of things. And I think I was right; I think time has proven me right, to a large extent.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nYes. I do believe that. Yes.Q.And you said that yesterday as well. And I think everybody would love to see the pandemic come to an end; there's no doubt about that.\nBut I wanted to ask you about a forecast that has come out from the IHME at the University of Washington. And they're forecasting, by January the 1st of next year, that we'll have 410,000 American deaths from coronavirus, which is 225,000 from where we are right now. So can you explain how you see us \"rounding the corner\"——\nSure.\nIf I didn't close up our country; if I didn't stop, China—highly infected—from coming in; if I didn't stop Europe from coming in far sooner than anybody else, including Dr. Fauci and others, wanted to—and Dr. Fauci was very nice; he said, \"President Trump made a great decision\"—we would have far more than that.\nBut maybe even more importantly, if I didn't close up, we would have—instead of the number that you mentioned or whatever it may be—it were—about 180—we would have perhaps 1½ or 2 million deaths right now if I went a different direction, which some people wanted me to do. And I decided not to do it. We'd have 2 million deaths.\nNow, a lot of countries don't report their deaths. Obviously, China is not reporting, because they had far more than we did. China had far more deaths than we did, in my opinion. It's just my opinion. But they don't report their deaths or they don't report them accurately. And I could—I don't want to embarrass other countries, but I can tell you, there are other countries where the death toll is far higher than the United States, but they don't report to us. We report it to a level that nobody reports it.\nWe also do testing in cases—I watch your broadcasts and your—I read your information—your media outlets—very, very carefully. And I look at the word \"cases.\" And the reason, you know, it's—I say it 100 times; nobody wants to pick it up. But we do testing at a level that nobody ever dreamed possible. We have the best test, and we have, by far, the most tests.\nActually, India, as per your question before—India is number two, and they've done a good job. But they're about 40 million tests behind us, and they're a country of 1.5 billion people.\nNow, because of all these tests, we have far more cases. If we cut our cases in half, if we—if we cut our testing in half, we'd probably have about half the number of cases. If we cut it down to levels—there are some countries that don't test. They test when somebody walks into a hospital; that's the test you get. They walk into a hospital, they're sick; that's your test.\nWe have tested more and better. And you just see where we now have millions of tests coming in from a certain company that's done a fantastic job, and it's going to be anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes on the spot—very accurate test.\nBut if we had much less testing, no testing, we would have—you wouldn't be reporting cases. But you saw this—I don't want to go over the statistics. You all wrote it down. But you see how we're doing compared to the rest of the world, and you see—and if you took out New York, which has been a tragic situation with the amount of people that died in New York——\n——and in the nursing home.\nIf you took—sure. I'm just saying: New York has been, in particular, run—whether it's badly, incompetently; whether it's unfortunate—and I appreciated Governor Cuomo saying that I've done a phenomenal job, and he said very good things. He said bad things too, you know, later on, when he had no real other choice. But if you took out New York from those numbers, you can multiply our tremendous success by a lot.\nBut look, the bottom line is that the job we've done on COVID-19 or the China virus, China plague—call it whatever you want; got a lot of different names—but it's been incredible. And we've also helped a lot of other countries, especially with ventilators, because we are now—you know, we built ventilators at a level that nobody ever thought possible. So——\nNo, look. Look. Yes, but you didn't hear me. If we didn't do what I said, we would be at 2 million deaths right now.\nNo, they're not taking that into account. I had a choice to make; if we made the wrong choice, the number that you have, which is less than other countries—but the other countries don't report tests. They don't report them to the extent, and they're not accurate. You know that, and so do I. Because we have—you take a look at some of the things happening in certain other very large countries. First of all, we're a very large country. But you take a look at things happening with respect to the reporting of deaths in other countries, and I say, \"Give me a break.\"\nSo it's been amazing. But we made some moves at the beginning: China, big; Europe, big. But the biggest of all was closing it down, understanding the disease. And we did, and now we know it's the elderly. It's especially elderly if they have heart, diabetes—if they have problems. And we're watching it, and we're watching it very closely. And by the way, we're doing supertesting with respect to that—supertesting.\nBut if we did it a different way, instead of the number that you said—but basically, the number that we're at now is approximately 180,000—we'd be at 2 million people right now. Could be higher than that.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nI don't know anything about the Russia vaccine. I'm not sure. We have our vaccine, and our vaccine is—I think, it's going to be the standard. It's going to be great. And these companies are incredible. They've come up with the great vaccines over the years, and that's the vaccine that probably most of the people in this room are going to want to take. All right?\nIt's sitting in an account; has not been spent, but we're willing to spend it.\nNo, we're willing to spend it. I'd like to get approval from Congress. There's a theory that I don't have to do that, but I'd rather be up front, and I'd like to get approval from Congress. Let it go directly to the people. It would be a great stimulus. It's actually more stimulus than we're asking for, in terms of pure stimulus. This would be pure stimulus.\nI wouldn't have to let prisoners go—some very evil prisoners go. Like, think of it: The Democrats, in order to get what they want and in order to give us what we—they're talking about allowing prisoners to be released; prisoners that we don't want to be released. So in order that we get money to the American people, they want to say \"release prisoners\" and other things like that that are very bad. And we just can't do that. We don't want to do that.\nThe President's Feelings Regarding U.S. Servicemembers/News Media/Veterans\nWell, no, we have 11 people. I was just told—I was just told we have 11 people. There is nobody that feels more strongly about our soldiers, our wounded warriors, our soldiers that died in war, than I do. It's a hoax, just like the fake dossier was a hoax, just like the \"Russia, Russia, Russia\" was a hoax. It was a total hoax. No collusion. Just like so many other things. It's a hoax.\nAnd you'll hear more of these things, totally unrelated, as we get closer and closer to election. The magazine is a failing magazine, and nobody called me—nobody called me from the magazine and said, \"Do you have a comment about it?\" No, they just write whatever they want to write, because they figure you can't get sued. You can't get sued, but it's very—it's a very hard—bringing lawsuits.\nBut we have many witnesses, and it's a total—it's just a continuation of the witch hunt, so that it can, hopefully, effect the election.\nBut the American people are too smart. So whether it's the fake dossier that turned out to be a total fraud or so many other things—so many other things have turned out. I've been under investigation from before I even get elected. These people have gone after me more than any President in the United States in history—in the history of the United States. And it's a shame. It's a shame.\nAnd despite that, we've done more in the first 3½ years than any administration. There's been no administration that's done more. When you add it all up, there's been no—despite all of the horrible political games that have been played.\nBut there's nobody that's been—that's been able to do what I've done, and that includes the great MISSION Act, because what Obama passed was a joke. It was a joke. And we took it to a level that nobody thought possible, and that includes accountability.\nSo it's a disgrace that somebody is allowed to write things like that. It could have been—you know, a lot of times, the sources aren't sources; they don't exist. And sometimes, the sources are just people that are disgruntled, former so-called employees.\nFormer Chief of Staff John F. Kelly/The President's Alleged Comments Regarding Fallen U.S. Servicemembers/The President's November 2018 Travel to Paris, France/Defense Spending/National Economy\nI know John Kelly; he was with me. Didn't do a good job, had no temperament, and ultimately, he was petered out. He got—he was exhausted. This man was totally exhausted. He wasn't even able to function in the last number of months. He was not able to function. He was sort of a tough guy. By the time he got eaten up in this world—it's a different world than he was used to—he was unable to function. And I told him: \"John, you're going to have to go. Please give me your letter of resignation.\" And we did that. And now he goes out and bad mouths.\nNow, there are people that are jealous. There are people that are upset that they're not here anymore. There are people that—we've done an incredible job. The virus came in, and now we're doing an incredible job again. And we're going to build it up bigger than it was before the virus came in.\nBut I don't know that it was him. I haven't seen that. I mean, I see \"Anonymous,\" but it could have been a guy like a John Kelly because he was——\nJust so you understand, he was a very—if you look at some of his news conferences, what happened to him: He got eaten alive. He was unable to handle the pressure of this job. This job was a tough job. Mark Meadows is doing a great job, but Kelly was unable to do that.\nAnd as far as that day, I mean, we have so much proof as to going to the—I went to Paris and the environs, and I was all set to go. They had a rainstorm the likes of which you've rarely seen. The fog was so great; it was as dense as I've ever seen. And I almost knew that you couldn't use the helicopter. And because they had to drive through, I guess, certain parts of Paris, the Secret Service, who—by the way, we have people here that were on the trip. They're writing a report. Unable to even think about it. And I said: \"Nope, I want to go. I insist on going.\" It would have taken us forever.\nThe Paris police said, \"Please, you can't do this.\" They'd have to shut down various parts of Paris, and it just was not a possible situation. The helicopter would have been very quick. They had the helicopter all set, but the helicopter could never fly in that kind of weather. So—and that turned out—and that's all documented, by the way. We have all of the information from—and probably will release that information.\nBut I think it's a shame when a second-rate magazine—I don't read it; I know very little about this magazine. But when a second-rate magazine can write things like that about somebody that's done so much for the military, can write things like that and get away with it, where you actually ask questions on it, it's a disgrace, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself.\nAnd let me just tell you, I watched the interview with Sleepy Joe Biden, and he didn't ask questions. You didn't ask questions like that. Read the questions you asked. They were, like, meant for a child. Those questions were meant for a child. Smiles on faces of reporters—not like you and you. There were smiles on the reporters. \"What do you think?\" Take a look at those questions that they ask him. They were not meant for a grownup; they were meant for a child.\nSo I just want to just tell you—I just want to tell you it's a disgrace, because if you look at what I've done for the United States military, I love those people. I've gotten them pay raises when they didn't get anything near what I've been able to do. And I've rebuilt—$2.5 trillion. I've rebuilt the United States military. Now we're including Space Force. Nobody has done more for them.\nAnd then, when I have to have a report read like that from a third-rate magazine that's not going to be in business much longer, I look at that, and I think it's a disgrace. And then, when I watch Biden getting asked questions that are really meant for a child to answer—anybody could answer—and I look at the level of question that you people ask, I mean, honestly, it's disgraceful.\nSo I want to thank you all very much.\nWe appreciate it. And we're doing very well. We're very, very proud of what's happened with respect to the economy. And I think that before the election, you're going to see a third quarter announced. The third quarter will be at a level that our country has never seen before. Next year, we're going to have a year that was better than last year. And I feel very certain it'll be better than last year. It'll be the greatest year we've had.\nAnd the whole reason this is working out this way is, because we set a foundation for this country like we've never had before. So next year is going to be a fantastic year.\nBut remember this: The third quarter is going to be announced sometime prior to the election—by a few days, actually—and I think it's going to be record-setting-type numbers on GDP and other things.\nThank you all very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1259"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-07", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you. Happy Labor Day. That was, really, a very special time I had speaking to some of the labor union heads and other people. They're very happy with the way things are going. As you probably see, the numbers are terrific.\nSo we called some people, wished them a very happy Labor Day, and they told us how they're doing, and we really celebrate the American worker. We are in the midst of the fastest economic recovery in U.S. history. So we have a lot to be thankful for, including this really beautiful day. It's why I thought we'd do this outside as opposed to in your more normal place.\nThe United States experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western nation. You probably know that. You look around and see how we're doing compared to every other nation, and our rise is spectacular. And we're rebounding much more quickly from the pandemic.\nYou're going to have to take that off, please. Just—you can take it off. Your health—how many feet are you away?\nWell, if you don't take it off, you're very muffled. So if you would take it off, it would be a lot easier.\nIt's better, yes. It's better.\nNo, I don't understand that.\nNo, I don't understand it at all, no, because I've always been on the opposite side of John McCain. John McCain liked wars. I will be a better warrior than anybody, but when we fight a war, we're going to win them. And frankly, I was never a fan of John McCain. You know that; that's been very obvious. I was—but I had to approve his entire—his funeral. I wanted him to get—he deserved a first-class—you know, and it all was approved by me. We sent Air Force One to pick up the casket—a lot of things. But no, I was never a fan of John McCain, because he wanted the endless wars, and I didn't. I thought that the way the vets were taken care of—our great vets—was not good, not appropriate. And of course, he took the fake, dirty dossier and gave it over to the FBI. So this is not somebody—am I supposed to say, \"What a wonderful guy\"?\nSo, you know what? I lived with him. He lived with me. But we had different philosophies. I think my philosophy is right. I think it's turned out to be right. But I wasn't a fan. But I respect people, and I respect a lot of people. That doesn't mean I necessarily have to agree with them, and I didn't agree with him on a lot of things.\nThe story is a hoax, written by a guy who has got a tremendously bad history. The magazine itself—which I don't read, but I hear it's just totally anti-Trump; he's a big Obama person, he's a big Clinton person. And he made up the story. It's a totally made-up story.\nIn fact, I was very happy to see Zach Fuentes came out and said now he's—that's—I think that's number 15—and these are people that were there. That's the 15th person. General Kellogg, everybody that was there knew what happened. And so I was happy to see that Zach came out and said it's not true. He just came out.\nAnd it's a disgrace. Who would say a thing like that? Only an animal would say a thing like that. There is nobody that has more respect for not only our military, but for people that gave their lives in the military. There's nobody—and I think John Kelly knows that. I think he would know that. I think he knows that from me.\nBut Zach Fuentes, as you know, worked for John. And I think they both know that. But Zach came out, as you know, today or yesterday, last night, and said very strongly that he didn't hear anything like that. Even John Bolton came out and said that was untrue.\nNow, what was true is that we had the worst weather. I think it was as bad a rain as I've just about ever seen. And it was a fog you—you literally couldn't see. I walked out, and I didn't have—I didn't need somebody to tell me. I walked out and I said, \"There's no way we can take helicopters in this.\" I understand helicopters very well. And they said, \"No, sir, that's been canceled.\"\nThey would have had to go—Secret Service, I have the whole list—they would have had through a very, very busy section, during the day, of Paris. They would have had to go through the city. The Paris police were asking us, \"Please don't do it,\" because they're not ready. When you do that, you need a lot of time. They take days and days and days to prepare for that.\nI wanted to do it very badly. I was willing to sit in the car for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours. I didn't care. It didn't matter. And I had nothing else to do. I went there for that; I had nothing else to do. It was ended because of the terrible weather, and nobody was prepared to go through, in terms of Paris, the police, the military, and the Secret Service. And they came out very strongly and said, \"Sir, we can't allow you to make this trip.\" If I wanted to: \"Sir, we can't allow you, from a safety standpoint.\"\nIt was a phony story, just like the dirty dossier—the fake, dirty dossier; just like the Russia collusion; just like all of the other phony stories. And there'll be more phony stories.\nBut I do appreciate Zach coming out. But Zach now is the 15th person that's denied it. Zach now, I think, also talked about the weather aspect of it. And he's probably the 14th or 15th person that blamed it on weather. So that's enough of that.\nYes, please.\nThank you.\nWe're talking about where? Nonlethal force?\nThe riots?\nWell, I think what's happened is the—the toughness. These are Democrat-run cities, all. And there's no retribution. There's no—they stand there, they throw things at the people that are supposed to be protecting something, and nothing happens. They throw rocks. They throw cans of soup. They throw lots of hard objects. And rarely does anything happen.\nBut I've told, when we have the Federal in there—as you know, I told the U.S. Marshals to go get the man who killed a—another man. And they know who it was, and you have to arrest him. You have to arrest him. After 2½ days, they didn't arrest him. The U.S. Marshals went in, and it ended up being a gunfight, and the man was killed. But this is a man that had a bad record, and this is a man that killed a man in the street. I mean, I witnessed it; most people witnessed it. And the U.S. Marshals went in; they weren't playing games. They can't play games. If somebody is breaking the law, there's got to be a form of retribution.\nI watch—so often, when I watch some of the areas that we're talking about—now we have Rochester—that's, again, Democrat Governor, Democrat mayor. All Democrats, every one of them, and it always will be.\nI was with the Governor in Texas; he looked at me and said, \"I can't imagine how they allow this to happen.\" And you know, it's different. It's different. I could talk about other Governors saying the same thing.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nYes.\nYes.\nSo we have now over a thousand people—Federal—in jail. We're prosecuting many people. A big thing was when I signed the law putting people in jail, if you knock down monuments. That was 3 months ago. There hasn't been a Federal monument knocked down in 3 months, or even thought about. I don't think they've even thought about it. So that's had a very big impact—a very big impact.\nBut yes, we're going around, and the nice part is, you people take—see those people up there?—they take nice pictures of everybody, so we don't even have to bother. We can use the news photos. We had a photo right over there of Andrew Jackson, the monument. He was getting ready, and this guy was a big, brave guy, and he was up like this, and he was showing off to all his friends. And he got arrested, and so did a lot of other people get arrested. And I would say we have the ultimate proof. Now, in that case, we got there before they ripped down the statue of Andrew Jackson, which is so beautiful, which is right over there. But they never got it.\nBut right after that, I signed an order saying you go to prison for 10 years. And as soon as I signed that order, that was the end of the statues coming down. But they have other ideas. They've got plenty of ideas. They're not at want for ideas.\nPlease, go ahead.\nI don't think they are.\nYes.\nI know. I know.\nDon't say there's \"no hope.\" Why do you say there's \"no hope\"?\nWhat do you know?\nWhat do you know?\nAnd let me just tell you: I know my customers; that's what I do. I know Pelosi, I know Schumer very well. They don't want to make a deal, because they think it's good for politics if they don't make a deal. This has nothing to do with anything other than you have to know who you're dealing with. I do. These are people that I don't have a lot of respect. I don't think they have a lot of respect for the American people. And I know who I'm dealing with.\nAnd I don't need to meet with them to be turned down. They don't want to make a deal, because they know that's good for the economy. And if they make a deal that's good for the economy, and therefore it's good for me for the election in November—November 3—and therefore, they're not going to make a deal. Now, if we gave the store away, if we bailed out all of their Democrat-run cities where we give them a trillion dollars, which is the kind of money they want—they want a trillion dollars to bail out badly run, Democrat cities and States. Whether it's New York or Illinois or others, they want to bail them out. And we're saying, \"Well, we're not going to pay that kind of a price in order to bail the cities out.\" We'll do something to help cities, but that's going to have to rest on its own.\nAnd why didn't you do this at the beginning? Because they could have done it at the beginning. So I know who I'm dealing with.\nAnd I'm on the phone with Mnuchin and with Meadows and with all of these people constantly, you know, while they're there. But I also know when it's time to meet with people. I've done very well with deals, okay? That's what I do. And I know when it's time to meet. But I don't have to meet them in order to be turned down and in order for them to walk out to the sticks—which is the microphones—and give you people a false report of what just took place in the Oval Office.\nSo they don't want to make a deal because they think that if the country does as badly as possible, even though a lot of people are being hurt, that's good for the Democrats. But, David, that's a bad thing.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nI am taking the high road. I'm taking the high road by not seeing them. That's the high road.\nAnd if I thought it made a difference or would make a difference, I'd do it in a minute.\nYes. Sure. Sure.\nThey spied on my campaign. That's right.\nThey spied on my campaign. And if they were Democrats, they would have been in jail 2 years ago. They would have been in jail—literally, if this side were the Democrat side, they would have been in jail 2 years ago for 50-year terms for treason and other things.\nBut let me just—let me just tell you something: President Obama and Biden—Sleepy Joe, he knew everything that was happening. They were spying on my campaign, and they got caught. Now let's see what happens.\nBut if this were the opposite way, people would have been jailed. They would have been in jail already for a period of at least—it would have started 2 years ago, and it would have been 50 years for treason, because you can't do that. That's never—and nothing like that's ever happened before. Then, they created, at tremendous expense—the money they paid is tremendous; I'm sure you know the money that was paid, millions of dollars. They created a fake dossier—a fake dossier—proven to be, now, fake. Everyone—and they used it in the FISA courts. That's a crime.\nSo far, I haven't seen anybody have a problem. But the report hasn't been issued yet. Let's see what happens with the Durham report.\nBut this started at Obama, and some people would say—and some people, \"Well, but he was President,\" like, \"Let's leave him alone.\" If it were me, they wouldn't be leaving me alone, I can tell you. It's a totally double standard, and it's a disgrace.\nAnd if I were a Republican Senator and if I were a Republican Congressman—and we have some great ones, but we have a lot of them that don't fight the way that the other side fights. We have much better policy. We have much better things going for us, like borders and walls and immigration and no sanctuary cities. And a lot—they have a lot of bad stuff going, but they're dirty fighters.\nAnd the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested. They're not requested; they're just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, nonrequested. I call them \"unsolicited ballots.\" That's going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they're going to say, \"What am I doing?\" And then, they're going to harvest. They're going to do all the things.\nAnd if you look at the last period of 6 months—take a look at the races where they've sent ballots out. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney, whose race should be redone because she won that race totally unfairly to her opponent. Her opponent did very well against her. That race should be rerun, but they declared her the winner, because they heard I found out about it. But take a look at what's happened in New Jersey and in Virginia, in different places. It's a disgrace. That will be a beauty.\nYes, please.\nYes, I don't know too much about it. I read something this morning, but I don't—other than that, I'd have to see it. He's a very respected man. He was approved very much by both parties, I guess. It was sort of an approval that took place by both parties. I don't know exactly what the story is. I'll certainly know within a short period of time. I just read it for the first time—I read it this morning, just like you did.\nSure. Sure.\nI think let the investigations go. But he's a very respected man. Again, it was a bipartisan commission. Postmaster General is appointed by a bipartisan commission. And we'll see how that goes. But no, I think he's a very honest guy, but we'll see.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes. If something can be proven that he did something, always. You know?\nAlways. They've been looking at me for 4 years; they found nothing. Four years. Think of it: For 4 years—from the day I came down the escalator, I've been under investigation by sleaze, and they found nothing. They found nothing. A friend of mine said, \"You have to be the most innocent, honorable man ever to hold the office of President.\"\nThink of it: They spent—just Mueller alone, he spent—I guess the real number turned out to be $48 million, but whatever it was—many, many millions of dollars. They had 18 angry Democrats looking. They had FBI agents all over the place. They had every—and they have no collusion. Friends of mine have said—sophisticated friends have said, \"You've got to be the most innocent guy ever to hold this office.\" And there's a lot of truth to that.\nYes, please.\nSure.\nNo, I have nothing against John. I have nothing against anybody. No.\nI was very heartened to see that a friend of his—because I know Zach is a friend of his and worked for him—I was very heartened to see that Zach Fuentes came out with the statement that he did—I guess, late last night—that it was not true.\nWell, we're going to do a report. Yes, I fired those people; they're all gone. And it was a disgrace, frankly. And we're going to give you a big report that's going to make you very happy.\nAll right, yes, please.\nNo, they say worse; they say negative. They say negative. They're going to make the vaccine into a negative so that when we have it—and I spoke to the head of Pfizer, I spoke to the head of Johnson and Johnson, I spoke to the heads of the greatest medical companies in the world. We're doing great. We're going to have it soon.\nWait a minute. So now what they're saying is: \"Oh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.\" By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for 3 years, and you probably wouldn't have it all.\nSo we're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I'm talking about.\nBut let me just tell you—wait. And what they're doing, because they think it is going fast. And if you talk to a lot of your sources—if you have sources—if you talk to your sources in the FDA, you'll see it's going very, very well. The numbers are looking unbelievably strong, unbelievably good.\nSo now they're saying: \"Wow, Trump has pulled this off. Okay, let's disparage the vaccine.\" That's so bad for this country. That's so bad for the world to even say that. And that's what they're saying.\nBut I watched Kamala's poll numbers drop from 15 to almost zero and then drop out even before she ran in Iowa because people didn't like her, and I understand why. She will never be President—although I have to be careful, because Obama used to say that about me. So I have to be a little bit careful.\nBut you have to look at her a little bit more closely, because obviously Joe is not doing too well. So you're going to have to look at her a little bit too closely.\nBut she's talking about disparaging a vaccine so that people don't think the achievement was a great achievement. I don't want the achievement for myself, I want something that's going to make people better, that people aren't going to get sick with. That includes therapeutics, where we're doing equally as well. Therapeutics.\nGo ahead.\nYes.\nNo, I didn't say—I didn't say \"they will.\" I said, \"By the end of the year.\"\nNo, but you're not quoting me accurately.\nI said that vaccines will be on the market before the end of year, but they may even be on the market—they may even be developed and fully developed, tested, and everything else.\nYou know, we have 30,000 people, in just one vaccine right now, under test in very, very highly infected areas. So we're going to be able to get a good result, one way or the other, very soon.\nSo I didn't say what you said. What I said is \"by the end of the year.\" But I think it could even be sooner than that. It could be during the month of October, actually. Could be before November.\nNo, I'm saying that because we want to save a lot of lives. The fast—with me, it's the faster, the better. With somebody else, maybe they would say it politically, but I'm saying it in terms of this is what we need. We have to have—if get the vaccine early, that's a great thing, whether it's politics or not.\nNow, do benefits inure if you're able to get something years ahead of schedule? I guess, maybe they do. But the most important thing to me is saving lives; it's the most important thing.\nYes, go ahead. In the back.\nYou sound so clear—[laughter]—as opposed to everybody else, where they refuse.\nYes.\nYes, so—no, I want everybody to know everything they can about our history. I'm not a believer in cancel culture, the good or the bad. If you don't study the bad, it could happen again. So I do want that subject studied very, very carefully and very accurately.\nBut we grew up with a certain history, and now they're trying to change our history—revisionist history. That's why they want to take down our monuments. That's why they want to take down our statues.\nI saw something the other day, which was absolutely horrendous: Washington Monument, they want to rename it—the DC committee, but the DC committee is all Democrats. Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson—I mean, we're talking about—this is the big stuff now. This is the big stuff. And they want to rename it. They want to redesignate it. They want to take some down. No, we don't do that. Never going to happen with me, I guarantee you that.\nWell, I want to thank you all, and I just want to wish you a very happy Labor Day. And we're having tremendous success, whether it's on the vaccines, whether it's on the pandemic—the plague that came in from China, that China should have never let happen, because I will never feel the same about China.\nAnd I just want to again wish you a happy Labor Day.\nThank you very much, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1260"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-10", "Text": "Thank you very much. Wow. We have some big ones today, huh? This is a room, all loaded up. Wow. Paula Reid [CBS News]. Jonathan Karl [ABC News]. Phil Rucker [Washington Post]. Hi, Phil. How are you? Kaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN]. We've got the all-stars. A lot of all-stars today. You too.\nYou too. That's good. Well, that's fine.\nThank you very much. In the past 4 months, we've added 10.6 million jobs, including 643 [thousand]* manufacturing jobs and 658,000 construction jobs. It's far beyond expectations.\nWe've experienced the smallest contraction of any western nation, meaning we've been affected less than any other Nation—western nation—and probably, almost, I think you can put us in—I just saw some numbers—I think you can put us into just about any category anywhere. And the fastest recovery by far. And that's anywhere. Nobody has recovered like we're recovering.\nIf we followed Joe Biden's strategy, we'd shut down the entire country after just having set records on growth. And we also did have tremendous retail growth, as you probably noticed. We're witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in our history. By contrast, the Obama-Biden administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history, as you know.\nWe continue to make progress in our fight against the China virus. New weekly cases have declined by 44 percent since July. Deaths declined by 20 percent compared to just last week. It's going down very rapidly. Really rapidly. This is in contrast to nations in the European Union, which have recently experienced a sharp increase in cases. They're having a very big spike over there. We're, hopefully, beyond our spike, and we'll see, but we're doing very well all over our country.\nIn the past 5 weeks, per capita cases doubled in France; surged to over 300 percent in Spain, which I've been hearing about and speaking to some of the leaders of Spain, and they are having a hard time; and increased more than 400 percent in Italy again. And as you remember, I stopped—I put a ban on people coming in from Europe after the ban I imposed on China, Wuhan—but because of Wuhan primarily, because that area was very infected. We also put a ban on Europe. So Spain is being heavily impacted, France, and 400 percent in Italy.\nYesterday European nations experienced 50-percent more deaths than the United States. And you don't hear these things. You don't hear these statistics. But the United States has done really well. Very proud of everybody that worked on this. And I really do believe we're rounding the corner.\nAnd the vaccines are right there, but even—not even discussing vaccines and not discussing therapeutics, we're rounding the corner. We already have therapeutics out there, by the way, which are having obviously a very big impact, because you look at that, you look at the way people are recovering, it's so much better than in the past before we knew about the disease and had anything to fight the disease. On schools, as part of our science-based approach, we want schools to safely open and stay open. Children are at extremely low risk of complications from the virus. Less than 0.2 percent—0.2 percent of the coronavirus deaths have occurred in those under the age of 25, and most had underlying conditions where there was a problem.\nThere is no substitute for in-person learning. According to a recent study, student progress in math decreased by half and—using online education compared to in-person or campus education. So, online, we think of so many things online and how great it is; there's nothing like being in the classroom. That's what we've learned from this whole ordeal.\nAccording to the CDC, school closures disproportionately harm low-income and minority children, as well as those with disabilities. And I think you see some slides behind me that are very new, very current. It's also crucial for colleges and universities to stay open. And we hope that they do indeed stay open, and we want to see Big 10 football. We hope it's coming back. We have a lot of the colleges that we're talking about, they want to come back. We hope that Michigan agrees.\nWe hope that—and I know the Governor will have a lot to say about it. We hope she approves it. But we have a couple that—Maryland is another one. We hope the Governor puts a little pressure on so that we can have it, but I have a feeling they may do it. They may do it without having everybody, but I think they're going to have maybe Michigan, maybe Maryland. We have a couple of States that might not participate.\nBut people are working very, very hard to get Big 10 football back, and I'm pushing it. And it will be a great thing for our country and the players. And the coaches want to do it really badly. The players are missing—they only have so many years of this. And the players are missing a big opportunity, including the chance, in some of the cases—they have some of the best players, college players in our country, and they want to get into the NFL, and they want to make money in the NFL, and they're not going to be able to do that too easy if you don't get to see them play.\nIt's much safer for students to live on campus—and low-risk young people would—rather than the alternative. It's—the alternative is no good—than going home spreading the virus to high-risk Americans. It's—they want to be on campus. They want to go back to school. And the parents want them back in school, maybe more so than they want to be back in school. And they want them back safely, and they want to go back safely, but they have to go back.\nBased on the recent data from more than 20 colleges, not a single student who tested positive for the virus has been hospitalized. So that's a lot of people. That's a lot of students. Not one has been hospitalized.\nAs we continue to follow the science-based approach to protect our people and vanquish the virus, Joe Biden continues to use the pandemic for political gain. Every time I see him, he starts talking about the pandemic. He's reading it off a teleprompter. I'm not allowed to use a teleprompter. Why is that, Phil? They ask questions, and he starts reading the teleprompter. He says, \"Move the teleprompter a little bit closer, please.\" I don't know, I think if I did that, I'd be in big trouble. I think that would be the story of the year.\nWhen I took early action in January to ban the travel and all travel to and from China, the Democrats and Biden, in particular, called it \"xenophobic.\" You remember that? Joe was willing to sacrifice American lives to placate the radical-left, open-border extremists. And we saved tens of thousands of lives, probably hundreds of thousands of lives. And we saved millions of lives by doing the closing—and now the opening—the way we did it.\nJoe's decision to publicly attack the China ban proved he lacks the character or intelligence or instinct to do what is right. Now Biden has launched a public campaign against the vaccine, which is so bad, because we have some vaccines coming that are incredible. Scott was telling me about some of the things that are happening, and it's very exciting, Scott. Thank you for being here. But you don't want to have anything having to do with, for political purposes, being an antivaxxer. You don't want to be talking about the vaccines in a negative way, especially when you see the statistics that we're starting to see. They're incredible, actually.\nBiden is perfectly happy to endanger the lives of other people by doing something that he thinks is going to help him politically, because his polls are getting very bad. They're getting very shaky. This was an election that was going to be very easy, very quick, and then the China virus came in, and I had to go back to work politically, unfortunately. I had to devote more time politically than to the other things we do, which are very important for our country. But I had to go back to work. And it looks like we're going up very rapidly, more rapidly than the media wants to admit.\nAnd Biden has had to go out. He's gotten out of his basement, and he's working. Let's see what happens. But we've got to talk about how great these vaccines are if, in fact, they're great. And I think you're going to see numbers that are going to be very, very impressive.\nThe approach to the virus is a very unscientific blanket lockdown by the Democrats—that's what they're talking about—which takes all of these incredible statistics, records, and it throws them out the window. Now, they did say it would be based on the recommendation of the experts, but you know, whether expert or not, we're not doing any more shutdowns. We did the shutdown, and now we're doing the opening, and there won't be any more shutdowns.\nThere could be a little section, a small section, where you have a breakout, but we're not talking about shutdowns like they were talking about, depending on experts. We're not going to be doing that.\nThe swine flu was a disaster, you remember, when—not nearly as deadly, not—not the same world. But when Joe Biden was Vice President, his failed approach to the swine flu was disastrous. He called it N1H1; it's actually H1N1. You know, you remember the \"H\" comes before the \"N,\" so it's sort of easy to remember, right? But Joe always calls it the opposite way, but it was—call it the \"swine flu.\" It was disastrous.\nAnd his own Chief of Staff said that when Biden helped manage the swine flu in 2009, they, quote, \"did everything possible wrong.\" And 60 million Americans got H1N1 in that period of time. This is a quote from his Chief of Staff. And it's just \"purely a fortuity that this isn't one of the great mass casualty events. It had nothing to do with us doing anything right because we did everything wrong.\" It was a disaster. It was a disaster. And now he's telling us how to manage—he can't manage himself.\nTwo hundred and seventy thousand Americans were hospitalized during this attack. The outbreak was so rampant that the Obama administration told States to stop testing. \"We don't want any tests,\" because they don't want to show all of the things that tests show. By the way, we're setting a record on testing. Our testing is at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We're substantially greater than the second country—which is India, by the way, which has 1.5 billion people. But we're 50 million tests ahead—50 million ahead.\nAnd they ordered the CDC to stop counting tests and stop counting cases and then left us a depleted stockpile, which is what I inherited. I inherited a depleted—a very badly depleted—stockpile. In other words, Biden's record demonstrates that if he had been in charge of this very serious, highly, highly contagious epidemic or pandemic—the China virus—countless more Americans would have died. And if we didn't do what we did—and I say it all the time now, because the media likes to belittle. What we've done has been incredible. Now you can look at Europe and you can look at other places, and you can start comparing.\nBiden is weak on China. Yesterday it was revealed that a fund—partly owned by Joe Biden's son Hunter—facilitated the sale of a Michigan auto parts producer to a leading Chinese military defense contractor. You don't want to write about that, do you? Biden spent his entire career selling Michigan jobs to China. Now the Biden family is selling out our country directly to the Chinese military, which has to do with this company that Hunter—here we go with Hunter again. He didn't have a job; now, all of a sudden, he's selling companies from Michigan to China.\nChina's military got American manufacturing jobs, and the Biden family got paid a lot of money. And I say it, \"If Joe Biden ever got elected, China will own America.\" He will—they will own America.\nFinally, I can announce with great pride that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be departing this evening on a historic trip to Doha—that's Qatar—for the beginning of intra-Afghan peace negotiations. We've been negotiating with them for quite some time, getting along with them, moved a lot of soldiers out.\nI got a report this morning that there's been nobody killed in Afghanistan since early February. It's a long time. There's been no deaths, no problems. And a lot of progress is being made in Afghanistan. But we'll be down to 4,000 soldiers in a very short period of time.\nLikewise, Iraq: We'll be down to about 2,000 soldiers in a very short period of time. And, in Syria, for the most part, we're out, other than we kept the oil. And so we have soldiers guarding the oil—not too many; I think a small number—but they're guarding the oil. And we're helping the Kurds, and we're making their lives much more pleasant, because of the fact that we have the oil.\nSo we're pretty much out of Syria. We're pretty much out of Iraq. And we're down to the smallest force that we've had in—we'll be very shortly down to that number in Afghanistan.\nThe negotiations are a result of a bold diplomatic effort on part of my administration in recent months and years. The United States will play an important role in bringing the parties together to end the decades-long war; it's been going on for almost 20 years, long before I got involved, I can tell you that.\nAnd had they not been wasting our time with all of the phony witch hunts and all of the things, we probably could have done this even faster. But a lot of time had to be spent wasted like that. But the parties are together right now, and we're negotiating, and we're really making tremendous progress.\nNext week at the White House, we'll be having a signing between U.A.E. and Israel, and we could have another country added into that. And I will tell you, countries are lining up that want to go into it.\nAs you know, U.A.E. is headed by a very, very highly respected gentleman and respected by everybody. And he's a warrior too. He's a great warrior. And Mohammed is very excited about this. And you'll be hearing other countries coming in over a relatively short period of time.\nAnd you could have peace in the Middle East. I think what, ultimately, will happen is, you're going to have quite a few countries come in. The big ones are going to be coming in. I spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia, so we're talking. We're starting a—we just started the dialogue. And you'll have them come in. And I think two things are going to happen: Iran will—if we win the election, Iran will come and sign a deal with us very, very rapidly, within the first, I would say, week, but let's give ourselves a month—because their GDP went down 25 percent, which is, like, an unheard of number, and they'd like to be able to get back to having a successful country again. So I think that'll happen.\nAnd I think, very importantly, the Palestinians will get back into the fold. And when they see all of these countries that, frankly, have been supporters of the Palestinians—very big supporters and, certainly, financial supporters.\nAs you know, we used to pay the Palestinians $750 million a year, and I ended that some time ago, on the basis that they didn't seem to want to make peace. And we'll think about it once we have a deal, but I've ended that quite a while ago. I'm frankly surprised they haven't been to the table earlier.\nBut this is the best way. This is a way that's going to be great. This can really bring the Middle East together.\nAnd again, since February, we haven't had a death in Afghanistan, which is—it's a record for many years. Not a death. And we're getting along very, very well with the Taliban and very well with Afghanistan and its representatives. And we'll see how it all goes. It's a negotiation.\nBut Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be departing in a little while. So I think that's very exciting news. And a lot of people thought that my natural instinct is war; no, my natural instinct is actually peace. When we were on the debate stage, people used to say, \"Will it be 1 week or 2 weeks before President Trump gets into a war?\" But that's not—I did rebuild our military. We have a military that—2½ trillion dollars—new jets and rockets and tanks and ships and a lot of things we have. We have the newest, best military we've ever had. So, hopefully, we won't have to use it.\nOur nuclear program has been put into gear like never before, and in particular, hopefully, we won't have to use that, because that's a whole new level of destruction. And we never want to—just have to pray to God we never have to use that.\nAll right, please, Jon.\nSuch a terrible question and the phraseology. I didn't lie. What I said is: We have to be calm; we can't be panicked. I knew that the tapes were there. These were a series of phone calls that we had—mostly phone calls. And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect, just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.\nBut I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of, you know, calls. So we did that. I don't know if it's good or bad. I don't even know if the book is good or bad, but certainly, if he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it, because he thinks that—you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact. And he didn't report it because he didn't think it was bad. Nobody thought it was bad.\nWait a minute. Wait a minute. And your question—the way you phrased that is such a disgrace. It's a disgrace to ABC television network. It's a disgrace to your employer. And that's the answer. Are you ready? Because I——\nOf course, I didn't. Of course, I didn't.\nNo, no. No, no.\nNo. And five times, right? Five times. You ever hear the expression, \"five times\"? We've had flu years where we lost 100,000 people. The flu is a very serious problem for this country also. And we've been losing them—Scott, what kind of a number have we lost over the years with flus? Into the hundreds of thousands?\nWhite House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas.Well, I mean, the last 5 years have been something like 35- to 80,000 per year, every year, even with antiviral drugs and even with vaccines.\nFlu is a very serious problem also.\nOkay.\nListen, what I went out and said is very simple: I want to show a level of confidence, and I want a show strength as a leader, and I want to show that our country is going to be fine, one way or the other. Whether we lose one person—we shouldn't lose any, because this shouldn't have happened. This is China's fault. This is nobody's fault but China. China should not have allowed it to happen.\nWhether you have a—one person, 180,000 people, or 2½ or 3 million people, which it could have been very seriously if we didn't make the moves. And when you look at the opposition, where they said, \"Oh, why did he put the ban on?\"—Doctor Fauci said we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by putting the ban on China and then, ultimately, putting the ban on Europe. There was no lie here.\nWhat we're doing is we're leading, and we're leading in a proper way. And if, frankly, somebody else was leading it, they wouldn't have closed it.\nIf you look at Nancy Pelosi, you look at Cuomo, you look at de Blasio, you look at Biden, months later, they said there's no problem—they're talking about me. Months later. And before any statement was made—you have to remember, I put the ban on China. So, obviously, outwardly, I said it's a very serious problem. And it's always a serious problem. That doesn't mean I'm going to jump up and down in the air and start saying: \"People are going to die! People are going to die!\" No. No. I'm not going to do that.\nWe're going to get through this. And we're, right now, I hope—really think we're going to—we're rounding the final turn. And a lot of good things are happening with vaccines and with therapeutics, but there's no lying. And the way you ask that question is very disgraceful.\nPhil, go ahead, please. Go ahead.\nYes, I do think so. And I think we did a great job. I think we did a great job. And the people that did such—our generals, our admirals, Mike Pence, all of the people that have worked so hard—and now Dr. Atlas—all of the—Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx—they should be respected for the job they've done.\nAll I'm doing is—no, I don't want to jump up and down and start screaming \"Death! Death!\" because that's not what it's about. We have to lead a country. We're leading a great country, and we're doing a great job.\nAnd the people that have done such a good job should be given the kind of credit that they deserve. We possibly have done the best jobs when you start looking at what we're doing with the vaccines and therapeutics and ventilators. We had no ventilators, Jon. We make thousands of ventilators now a month, and we're supplying them to the whole world. The job we've done is the best job. And don't give me any credit; give the people that have done this the credit. They've done a great job.\nYes, Phil. Go ahead.\nWell, I don't know what—what Angela is doing. But if you look at the European Union right now, they're having breakouts like you've never seen before. And, frankly, their numbers are at a level that are much worse than the numbers here.\nWe are—we have done—we have—Phil, we have done much, much better than the European Union. I just read you numbers that are not good on their behalf; that are very good at ours. And we have rounded the final turn, and we have—we're going to have vaccines very soon——\n——maybe much sooner than you think. Listen, maybe much sooner than you think. But we have done a phenomenal job, and the people that have done this job—including the American public that's had to put up with a lot with the lockdowns and all of the things that they had to do—they have to be given credit. They have to be given credit.\nPlease, go ahead.\nWell, let me ask you this: If Bob Woodward thought that was bad—because this is stuff that everyone knew. There's a report that I have here someplace where China said it was airborne earlier than the statements I made. People knew it was airborne. This was nothing—this was no big—when I say it was airborne, everybody knew it was airborne. This was no big thing.\nBut read the reports. China came out with a statement that it was an airborne disease. I heard it was an airborne disease. I assumed it early on. The fact is, there has to be a calmness. You don't want me jumping up and down, screaming: \"There's going to be great death. There is going\"—and really causing some very, very serious problems for the country.\nIf Bob Woodward thought what I said was bad, then he should have immediately, right after I said it, gone out to the authorities so they can prepare and let them know.\nBut he didn't think it was bad, and he said he didn't think it was bad. He actually said he didn't think it was bad.\nThe only one that said it was bad or thinks it was bad were the fake news media, because they take it and they try and put it a certain way.\nIf Bob Woodward thought it was bad, then he should have immediately gone out publicly, not wait 4 months. You know, he's had that statement for 4 months, maybe 5 months. He's had it for a long time. It was a series of taped interviews, mostly by telephone—quick ones, not long ones. Quick ones. And it was—I did it out of curiosity, because I do have respect, and I want to see—I wonder whether or not somebody like that can write good. I don't think he can, but let's see what happens.\nYes, please.\nYes.\nWell, I can't tell you that yet. I have to see. I'm not involved in it. I purposely stayed uninvolved. I'm, I guess, considered the chief law enforcement officer of the country. I could be involved if I wanted to. I thought it would be better if I wasn't. I think it's better if our great Attorney General handle it. He has Durham, who is a very, very respected man, and we're going to see what it is. I can't tell you that.\nI can tell you this—I can tell you this: They lied, they cheated, they leaked, they got caught. They spied on my campaign. Never in history has there been anything like this. And I guarantee if the roles were reversed and I was on the Democrat side, people would have been in jail at the very highest level. People would have been in jail for 2 years already. Nothing like this has ever happened. And the term would be for many, many years, because it's treason, and other words can be used also.\nWell, I think—just on what I read in your wonderful papers, I think—and see what, you know, just looking at the media—not even what I know. I think Comey is a disgrace to our country. I think Strzok—who just wrote a book, which is a total fake—is a disgrace. I think Page—Lisa Page, his lover—is a disgrace to our country. I think that when you look at McCabe, where his wife got $700,000 in campaign contributions from Hillary Clinton—right?\nAnd then Hillary Clinton is under investigation, and yet she paid the head of the FBI—one of the top people, but actually the head, because he took over for the other guy, who fortunately I fired. I made a good move when I fired. That was a smart move, because they were looking to take down this administration, duly elected administration. So I fired him. That was a great move when I fired him. Because maybe, if I didn't, I wouldn't be here talking to you as President.\nBut when McCabe's wife gets $700,000 in campaign contributions when she was running for whatever office she was running from—from Virginia—and yet he's in charge of the investigation of Hillary Clinton. Now, he says, \"Well, I wasn't really in charge.\" Of course, he was in charge. He was totally in charge. He knew exactly what was going on.\nThese people got caught in the—probably the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They got caught.\nNow, what the Durham report is going to say, I can't tell you. But if they say half as much as I already know—just from seeing it. You know, you have people—I watch some of the shows. I watch Liz McDonald; she's fantastic. I watched Fox Business. I watched Lou Dobbs last night, Sean Hannity last night, Tucker last night, Laura. I watched \"Fox and Friends\" in the morning. You watch these shows; you don't have to go too far into the details. They cover things that are—it's really an amazing thing.\nThey got caught in the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They were spying on their opponent's campaign. Not only spying; they were making up fake dossiers. You have the dirty dossier. They were making up the dirty—and it was all made up. It was all fiction. It turned out to be fiction. And then, they were using that in the FISA courts—this revered court. Well, it's not so revered anymore, because when you look at what they did and how they played it—and they hurt a lot of people.\nGeneral Flynn is still being hurt, and he's being hurt very badly. He's a wonderful person. I spoke to General Milley about General Flynn 2 weeks ago. I said, \"What do you think of General Flynn?\" He said: \"He's a great soldier, sir. And he's a wonderful, wonderful human being.\" He's been destroyed. He's been destroyed. No, I think that this—without knowing anything about what Durham is going to release—the \"Durham report,\" we'll call it, or maybe it's going to be more than a report. Maybe it's going to be much more than a report, I don't know. Maybe it's a report or maybe it's much more than that.\nBut when I look at the—the things that everybody in this room knows, just from reading about it from yourselves back and forth, I think it's a disgrace to our country. And I think if people don't pay a very, very substantial price, it will happen again. And this should never ever happen to another President.\nThank you very much. Thank you, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1261"}
{"Title": "Interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox News", "Date": "2020-09-12", "Text": "Well I think a statement like that is criminal because we did a much better job than he could ever have done. As you know he was months later before he even thought the ban was a good thing and ultimately he had to apologize for what he did. We would have lost hundreds of thousands of lives and what I said to Woodward was actually good. I said calm, we need calm. We don't need panic. You want me to jump up and down and start screaming, is everyone going to die, is everyone going to … That's not what leadership is about. I'm a cheerleader for the country. We need calm. That's all I've said, and by the way, that was done after, that was done after I had already banned China –\nFrom coming into the country. So I took big steps.\nSo Jeanine, I took tremendous steps, everybody knew how I feel, otherwise I wouldn't be banning China and then shortly thereafter I banned Europe. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives with each one of those bans and saved probably two or two and a half million lives by doing what we did early.\nLook, he is an opportunist and not a bad guy to be honest, he's doing his thing. His first book I didn't have anything to do with it and he wrote things that were false and untrue and I could have straightened it out and I said, \"Let me do,\" I took quite a few phone calls, 16 phone calls or something like that and we had some good conversations, not long, but good conversations. I don't even know if the book is good or bad. I can tell you that what this says is that I said don't panic, we don't want panic. The press will make everything look bad because it's fake, the fake news, most of it. I'd say 85% unfortunately, that's the number we're up to. But I discussed with him lots of different things. I think that they were very good discussions. We'll see how it comes out but on this subject if you look, and he's actually being [inaudible] because if he thought it was wrong, then he should have reported it early. If lives were going to be lost, he should have reported it early. The truth is he didn't think there was anything wrong with it and I think that he thought it was surprising that the press even picked it up. It's fake news. It's all fake news.\nWell go out and look at the great leaders of the world. Winston Churchill stood on the rooftops in London, very calm, making speeches. Winston Churchill. You want calmness. You don't want to somebody going to be jumping up and down. I could do that too. I could jump up and down, say, \"Oh, this is terrible. This is terrible.\" We want strength, we want leadership and we don't want panic.\nThey don't want it because they think it's going to make me look good and it wins the election for me but we're very close to a vaccine. We also have already come out with therapeutics. If you look at remdesivir and others, the plasma, you take a look at the things that we've come out with already and the number, we're 85% better in terms of fatalities. You look at the kind of numbers, I don't know if you've been seeing this but we're really rounding the corner and this is actually without anything further than we already have and we have some very good things out there already in terms of … I would say in terms of … You can't use the word cure yet but pretty close to a cure. You're going to be pretty close to a cure. The vaccine itself, I mean it could come out in October, but whether it's October, November, December, it's going to come out very soon. We have great companies that are very advanced and the results are going to be very good.\nWell it would be a disaster and we're setting records on job production. We're 10.4 million for the last four months. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this, we're setting records by millions and millions of jobs. The country's coming back, it's a super V, it's beyond a V, it's a super V, retail sales are beyond any number they were ever at. I mean think of it, we're doing numbers now as we're rounding I think the final turn, and that's with, without, it doesn't matter. With or without. Having the vaccine is great, it's going to happen very soon. Could happen in October, it could very well happen October but we're rounding the turn on the virus. They have to open up. It's only the Democrats that are closed and in my opinion they're closed for political reasons. They have North Carolina, you have Michigan, you have a couple of other states that are …\nNew York, I mean, look at New York, what they're doing in New York, that poor city with the restaurants. You can't go to a restaurant. It's like a ghost town. What they've done to New York and people are leaving is disgraceful between Cuomo and DeBlasio. That combination, I've never seen anything like it in my life. Coming from New York, it's a very sad thing to witness, but we have to open up our states, totally open them. They're keeping them closed because they want on November 3, they want to have the numbers as bad as possible. Based on the numbers that you're seeing it's not even affecting this but probably it would be better if these states were open. Forget about numbers though. The people that are inside those lockdowns, they're suffering between depression, losing their jobs, drugs, alcohol, all of the different things that are happening to those people. That's causing much more damage than the virus itself.\nIn the country. They're going to send out 80 million unsolicited. In other words people that don't even know what a ballot is, all of a sudden, here comes a ballot. Now we don't even know if the people are going to get it. That's my problem. Supposing they're not sending them to Republican neighborhoods. Supposing they're not sending them to wherever. Or supposing the people aren't giving them back, or they go out and they harvest them. Somebody … It could be either way, but the Democrats seem to do that. I mean they played that game for a long time.\nWell, you might have to prosecute a lot more. The fact is they're playing very dirty. 80 million ballots. We never had any number like that, anywhere close to that, and you're going to see a mess on Election Night that's going to be … It's going to be legendary, and all they have to do is say, \"Go out and vote,\" or request a ballot. Get what's called a solicited ballot or absentee, a lot of people use the word absentee. Get an absentee ballot where you request it, it comes to you, you vote and you send it back. That's different, but they're just sending out all over, they're sending out 80 million ballots.\nHow about signatures? They don't even want to have signatures verified.\nThey don't want to have signatures verified. Where are they sending them? Who are they sending them to? Who's sending them back? Who's sending them back? It's a very … It's so unconstitutional, it's so dishonest, and you have states that can't even do small elections that way.\nWell we're in courts, in many, many courts right now and hopefully the courts are going to decide because if they don't you're going to have one hell of a mess on Election Night.\nThat's right. Every problem.\nWe'll put them down very quickly if they do that.\nWe have the right to do that, we have the power to do that if we want. Look, it's called insurrection. We just send them in and we do it very easy. I mean it's very easy. I'd rather not do that because there's no reason for it but if we had to we'd do that and put it down within minutes, within minutes. Minneapolis, they were having problems. We sent in the National Guard within a half an hour. That was the end of the problem. It all went away.\nYou look at Kenosha. Look at the problems they had. In fact the sheriffs there, the police chief, they're all on my side, 100%. Law enforcement all over the country is on my side and I will say this. Look, we have … Even with the horrible things that are going on in New York and Chicago, all run by Democrats. Everything we're talking about is run by Democrats. We're not talking about one Republican place. It's all run by Democrats. Even the police chiefs, they're all quitting all over the country. Every single one, I think I saw 15 or 20, every single one of them is from a Democrat city. Look, before China sent us the plague, before the plague came in, we had the best crime numbers in history. When the plague came it changed things, let's face it, it changed things, but all of the problems are in Democrat run cities. They're badly run, the taxes are too much, they want to defund their police. Biden is all in that. He hasn't still to this day used the term law and order. He's afraid to use the term because he's going to lose. He would lose the radical left supporters that he's got if they even show up for him because there's a question as to whether or not they're going to show up, but they don't want to talk about law and order.\nOne other thing, you have a lot of people living in the suburbs, you know it well. You live in Westchester, you know it well. I ended a rule or regulation where low-income housing has been forced into the suburbs and this has been going on for a long time but especially so under Biden and Obama. I ended it, I terminated it. Not going to happen anymore unless I'm not here in which case they're going to [inaudible] worse. So the suburbs are not going to have these projects forced into them. Now who in the suburbs is not going to vote for me? They're going to make the projects bigger, better. They're putting Cory Booker in charge. I mean one of the most liberal, the most liberal is Kamala, but Cory's right there, and he's going to be in charge of building projects in the suburbs. You're going to destroy your suburbs. It's already happening because you see what's going on, you see what they've done. They take over the zoning and they force projects, projects. Really terrible situation.\nWell the suburbs are going to be next.\nAnd then their stupid kids.\nBy people that we're looking at right now. We're looking at them right now.\nNo, not yet, but you're going to be finding out pretty soon. Look, they're stupid people too, because they'll be overthrown as soon as they get their wish. These people don't respect them, they're just using their money. These are super liberal people that have money and they're helping these anarchists and their agitators and they're dangerous … Did you see what happened over the weekend with the people walking up to a restaurant and grabbing the steak off –\nThe plate and biting the steak and then dropping it down, two elderly people having dinner at a restaurant and they walk in and they take a steak and they take the potato and they eat it?\nWell in Kenosha they asked me in, and we did a job like nobody's ever seen before.\nThen you're not allowed to do it, unless you do insurrection in which case it's just not big enough for insurrection.\nYou don't need it. You don't –\nOh I'd be willing to do it in a heartbeat if you needed it but we don't need it. Our National Guard –\nOur National Guard is so good and so tough.\nBy the way, police departments, in places that we're talking about, Seattle, we were going into Seattle and they solved the problem the night before we got there.\nWe were getting ready to go, they heard we were going in.\nTed Wheeler's a disaster. He's a laughingstock. He went out to protest with the so-called agitators and they were going to destroy him. They were going to beat him up badly, he fortunately had security but they were going to beat him up badly. The man is a disaster. If he would say come into Portland, within a half an hour, the whole thing would be solved.\nThe governor's gotten closer. Look, what's going on out there? I will tell you –\nThe governor has gotten closer. I've spoken to the governor two days ago.\nThey're arresting a lot of people that we sent in the U.S. Marshals for the killer, the man that killed the young man on the streets. He shot him.\nI mean it was on television. Just cold-blooded killed him. He didn't like his hat or he didn't like something and it wasn't a Trump hat.\nIt was a lot, it was a religious hat, and he shot him, cold blood. Two and a half days went by and I put out when are you going to go get him? The U.S. Marshals went in to get him and in a short period of time, they ended in a gunfight. This guy was a violent criminal.\nThe U.S. Marshals killed him and I will tell you something, that's the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this. There can't be guys standing up that want to fight, they want to fight. You can't throw bricks at people [inaudible].\nSo what's going to happen, and this is a shame, you're going to have a backlash like you've never seen if these people don't stop. Because you have very smart, very tough people that aren't going to take it any more and once they say we're not going to take it anymore, its going to end in a very vicious backlash and that's a terrible thing.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-judge-jeanine-pirro-fox-news"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-16", "Text": "Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Good afternoon. Hurricane Sally made landfall, as you know, in Alabama and Florida last night as a category 2 hurricane, and has caused 35 inches of rainfall in some places. That's a lot.\nWe have hundreds of FEMA, Coast Guard; we have the National Guard personnel on the ground assisting response to the efforts. And Alabama is in great shape, and every place that we are working with the State governments—really in great shape. We are working very hard on that.\nBut it looks like it's going to be mostly safe, but just follow the instructions of all of your local and Federal people there. We have the best people that you can have. So I want to thank everybody. I want to thank everybody for working so hard in Florida. And they're very good at this. The people in Florida handle it; they know how to handle it. And the people working there know how to handle it.\nThe Governors have all been spoken to, and it's a combination of real spirit. And they have a tremendous esprit de corps. They have a tremendous sense of working on hurricanes; they've gotten very good at it. And we've certainly had plenty, even since I've been here. We've had a lot of them. So that's in good shape—Hurricane Sally.\nWe're going to talk about Big Ten football, but that's a terrific thing. We'll discuss that at the end. I just want to go into the vaccine distribution.\nToday my administration released our detailed national vaccine distribution plan, and that includes a plan to ensure that we swiftly deliver the vaccine directly to America's senior citizens in nursing homes. And it's all set. We have our military lined up. Everybody is lined up. And we think that's going to go very nicely. We're very close to that vaccine, as you know, and I think closer than most people want to say or certainly closer than most people understand.\nTo get the vaccine into the hands of American people, we're fully mobilizing the awesome power of American industry and also our military. This is the largest, fastest, and most advanced vaccine distribution effort in American history, by far. I was reading where Biden was saying that, oh, he's going to have a plan. They did so bad on swine flu, you wouldn't even believe it. Take a look at their record on swine flu. In fact, the person that headed it up said it was a total disaster.\nWe're on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October. So as soon as it is announced, we'll be able to start. That will be from mid-October on. It may be a little bit later than that, but we'll be all set.\nSo as soon as it's given the go-ahead—and they're doing trials, as you know—and as soon as it's given the go-ahead, we will get it out, defeat the virus. We've manufactured all of the necessary supplies so that as soon as the FDA approves the vaccine—and, as you know, we're very close to that—we'll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020 and a large number much sooner than that.\nI'm calling on Biden to stop promoting his antivaccine theories, because all they're doing is hurting the importance of what we're doing. And I know that if they were in this position, they'd be saying how wonderful it is. They're recklessly endangering lives. You can't do that. And again, this is really a case that they're only talking—just started talking a little bit negatively, and that's only because they know we have it, or we will soon have it. And the answer to that is very soon.\nThe case updates—it's very interesting to see what's happening because the test positivity rate is down among all age groups and has fallen below 5 percent for the first time since this whole nightmare of the China virus began. So it's fallen below 5 percent.\nThe number of hospitalized patients has decreased by 43 percent from mid-July—43 percent. Nationally, people sick with the China virus now make up only 1.5 percent of all emergency room visits. So we're down to the lowest number we've had—1.5 percent of emergency room visits is for the China virus.\nAnd thanks to our lifesaving therapies and treatments—I think this is the best of all, in terms of our great percentages and all the progress we've made—the fatality rate has fallen 85 percent since April—85 percent—fatality rate.\nIf you look at what we've done and all of the lives that we've saved—and I'm going to ask that a graph be put up, and now it's up. This was right at the beginning. This was our prediction that if we do a really good job, we'll be at about a hundred and—100,000 to 240,000 deaths. And we're below that substantially, and we'll see what comes out. But that would be if we did the good job. If the not-so-good job was done, you'd be between 1.5 million—I remember these numbers so well—and 2.2 million. That's quite a difference.\nSo we're down in this territory. And that's despite the fact that the blue States had tremendous death rates. If you take the blue States out, we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level. But some of the States, they were blue States and blue-State-managed.\nAnd by the way, we'd recommend they open up their States. I think it's very important that they open up their States, because if you look at certain of them—North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others—we have to get those States open. It's hurting people. It's hurting people far more than the disease itself.\nSo we would recommend that you open them; let your people have freedom. And it's unfair to your people to keep them closed at this stage. We know the vaccine—we know the vaccines are coming, but we know the problem; we understand who the vulnerable are, which is primarily people with medical problems, but in particular, people with medical problems that are older. So open up your states.\nTo facilitate routine testing of the nursing home residents and staff, we've delivered rapid testing devices to all 1,000—or, excuse me, 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide. So you have 13,850 certified nursing homes nationwide, and they are being facilitated in terms of testing and testing apparatus. Everything is there.\nWe also have new tests coming, and we have one in particular that I think I showed last night, which is literally two pieces of very fine cardboard. It's actually a lot of delicate things going on inside that cardboard, but it's an incredible test. It's very quick, it's very accurate, and moves along rapidly. We bought millions of those tests, and they're going to be distributed rapidly.\nSo the testing process, where—there's nobody in the world that has a testing process like ours. In addition to being a number one—number two, which is India, is close to 50 million tests behind us, I believe, Scott. Fifty million. They have 1.5 billion people. Tomorrow Vice President Pence will be announcing the findings of the Nursing Home Commission to continue protecting our most vulnerable, which is our senior citizens. And we're going to take good care of them.\nI want to congratulate Big Ten football. It's going—it's back. And I want to, in particular—I've been dealing with him—thank Commissioner Kevin Warren for the great job he did. We've been working with him for a while. There was a rumor being spread that I didn't want football back, and it was just the opposite. That was another disinformation rumor put out by the Biden campaign. And it was just the opposite. But it really spurred me into action.\nI called the commissioner a couple of weeks ago, and we started really putting a lot of pressure on, frankly, because there was no reason for it not to come back. And Kevin went in and worked very hard. I want to thank the players, the coaches for working along. And they wanted it very badly—the players and coaches, in particular; the parents also. And Big Ten football just announced, as you know, that their schedule—they announced a schedule, and it's going to be great; important to have.\nI want to recommend that the Pac-12 also get going, because there's no reason why Pac-12 shouldn't be playing now. And perhaps, they'll start with—at least partially—I had recommended today to Kevin and others that maybe you want to start off with 25 percent of the stadium, or you maybe want to start off with empty. I don't know. If it's—I think they could have fans go, frankly. But they want to be careful, they want to be safe, and they will be safe. They've got a very good testing process for the players, coaches, families, et cetera.\nAnd so I just want to congratulate Big Ten. It's going to be great. We're going to love watching that. And again, I want to recommend Pac-12—you're the only one now. Open up. Open up, Pac-12. Get going. Said the same thing to Big Ten, and they did, and now I'm saying it to Pac-12. You have time. You really have time right now. Get going.\nI want to thank all of those wonderful coaches, some of whom I spoke with. And we went through a process over the last couple of weeks. And I want to thank Congressman Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who, as you know, was a great football player. Some people know that; I know that. But Anthony was a great player, great receiver. Went to the NFL.\nAlso, I want to thank Tim Pataki of my staff. He worked very hard on this. And he was up day and night, working with Kevin and everybody else. So I want to thank Tim Pataki. Great job.\nSo Big Ten is back, and it's going to have, hopefully, a great season.\nThe Census recently found that in the second quarter of 2020, Hispanic Americans' homeownership reached a record alltime high. That's alltime in the history of our country. Yesterday the Census reported that median income for Americans increased by an unprecedented $4,400 last year to a record of $68,700.\nIn 2019, income inequality fell for the second straight year. The income gap widened under the Obama-Biden administration, and it widened fairly substantially, and it narrowed under the Trump administration. So there's a little fact that you didn't know. So it narrowed under us, and it widened under Obama. Income grew more, last year alone, than over the entire 8 years of Obama-Biden. And that's a big statement, but that's the way it is.\nIn 2019, 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. That's the largest poverty reduction under any President in history: 4.2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty. The Hispanic American poverty rate reached the lowest level ever—history of our country. Hispanic American poverty rate—lowest level ever.\nI created the greatest and fairest economy in history. The biggest gains went to lower income Americans, as they measure that kind of thing. We will be back to full strength very soon. We're going to have a fantastic year next year. It's looking like that. I think you're going to have an incredible third quarter. The numbers are looking very, very strong for the third quarter. We have numbers that we're going to put out tomorrow—some of the individual things: car production, housing production, housing ownership—so many different things are just at levels that nobody thought possible as we round the turn on the pandemic.\nThe antipolice crusade from the Democrats and the radical left—and radical-left Democrats also—has to stop. The left-wing war on cops puts our officers in danger and our communities at very grave risk. Can't do this.\nBiden described the police as \"the enemy.\" They're not the enemy; they're the friend. They're our friend. They're helping us. And if you go to—I just saw a poll—it just came out or recently came out—where African Americans, by 84 percent, wanted more police. They wanted safe neighborhoods.\nIn Phoenix last night, a Federal officer was gunned down in a drive-by shooting. In L.A. this weekend—everybody saw that—this horrible human being—or whatever you might want to call him—I think \"him.\" They're looking all over. There trying to find him. We're going to find out. We're going to get him.\nBut in L.A. this weekend, two sheriff's deputies were ambushed and viciously shot, and they can never be the same. They're getting better, but they can never be the same. I'll always stand by our heroes of law enforcement, and we want to stop this horrible rhetoric and stop it fast.\nI want to ask Scott Atlas to say a couple of words, because I heard Biden talking today about, \"He wants to come up with a distribution plan.\" A distribution—for the vaccine that we came up with.\nA couple of things: We came up with that vaccine—it will be announced fairly soon—but regardless, this month, next month—in a level of time that nobody thought was possible because of what we did with our FDA in terms of streamlining it. I want to thank Dr. Hahn.\nBut what we've done with the streamlining has been incredible, and very safely. Number one is safety. Number two is speed. But you can have perfect safety and have much more speed, and that's what we did.\nWe did this for more than the vaccine, having to do with the China virus. This was also for other things. So many other great drugs are out there that would take 10, 12 years to get them approved, and we've moved those schedules up a lot.\nBut if this were Obama-Biden, this would have taken 2, 3 years before you were at a stage where we are now at. So we're going to be very soon. And it's sort of funny to watch Joe Biden getting up and reading a teleprompter and saying how he would have done this. They had H1N1. He calls it the \"N1H1\"; it's H1N1. It's called the swine flu, and it was a disaster.\nAnd, as I said, the person that ran it for him said the worst things about it. I mean, just—they didn't know what they were doing, they quit. They had no clue. And that was easy, by comparison to this. This is the most contagious—contagious flu or virus that anybody has seen. This is unbelievable how contagious it is. You found that out.\nBut I watched Biden quickly as he discussed, without having—without knowing a thing about a distribution plan. And he said that we don't have a distribution plan, but we do indeed. Our military—we have military, we have everybody involved. It's a great plan, and it's a plan like no other.\nAnd we can start doing it, I believe, the day that we come up with the vaccine. When it's done, we'll start. That same day, or the day after. Our military is very much involved, and they deploy troops, they deploy—these are the generals that do logistics and all of those things. And we'll have it all over the county, and then, ultimately, hopefully, we'll helping the world with the vaccine. And it's very exciting.\nBut maybe I'd ask Scott Atlas to come up and describe a little bit about that and the distribution plan, in particular, because Biden acted as though there was no distribution plan, and we've been working on this for months, and it's ready. And Scott has really taken a hold of it and done an incredible job.\nAnd please, Scott. Thank you.\nWhite House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas.Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.\nThank you.\nGood, thank you.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nYes. Go ahead.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution\nNo, I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information. And I called him, and he didn't tell me that, and I think he got the message maybe confused. Maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we're ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced, and it could be announced in October. It could be announced a little bit after October. But once we go, we're ready.\nAs you know, Pfizer is making this. They're taking a tremendous financial risk, and they're spending billions of dollars on actually making this vaccine. They're at a stage where they're actually making it, because they feel very confident as to the results. They'll be announcing their results fairly soon. And no, he's—that's incorrect information.\nYes, well, I think so, but I don't think he means that. I don't think he—when he said it, I believe he was confused. I'm just telling you: We're ready to go as soon as the vaccine happens.\nI would say that—yes, we will start distributing it immediately.\nTo the general public, very shortly thereafter—I mean, really, to the general public: immediately. When we go, we go. We're not looking to say, \"Gee, in 6 months, we're going to start giving it to the general public.\" No, we want to go immediately. No, it was an incorrect statement. I saw the statement. I called him, and I said, \"What did you mean by that?\" And I think he just made a mistake. He just made a mistake. I think he misunderstood the question, probably.\nI think it would be very soon. I think our distribution process is going to go very quickly. I told you, we've engaged the military. We have a general who's in charge of all logistics, who delivers soldiers. He's a fantastic guy. He's supposed to be fantastic at what he does. And we figure that's better than any company you're going to hire. You can't hire a company like that.\nAnd I—we look to the distribution immediately after we get the word that it's good. And I think they're having tremendous success with the vaccine itself. I think the results will be early and strong. The safety has to be a hundred percent, and we're going to insist on that. And, obviously, the companies are going to insist on that also.\nScott, what would you think?\nQ1, he said.\nAnd you also have more than one company. You have Johnson & Johnson. You have Pfizer. You have Moderna. You have others. So we could conceivably have vaccines being given out by numerous companies, and they're all world-class companies. They're fantastic companies. That could happen also. Okay?\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nOkay, they're giving me studies on the deal. It has to be a hundred percent as far as national security is concerned. And no, I'm not prepared to sign off on anything. I have to see the deal.\nWe need security, especially after what we've seen with respect to China and what's going on. We want security. So I'll let you know. They're going to be reporting to me tomorrow morning, and I will let you know.\nThe what?\nWell, we're going to see about that. Amazingly, I find that you're not allowed to do that. You're not allowed to accept—and I said: \"What kind of a government—what kind of a thing is? If they're willing to make big payments to the Government, they're not allowed, because there's no—there's no way of doing that from a—there's no legal path to doing that.\" And I'm saying: \"Wait a minute. They're willing to make a big payment to the government, and we're not allowed to take the money? When does this happen? How foolish can we be?\" So we're going to—we're looking into that right now. You understand that.\nIn other words, I said: \"No, I want a big chunk of that money to go to the United States Government because we made it possible. And the lawyers come back to me and they say, \"Well, there's no way of doing that.\" You know why? Because nobody has ever heard of that before. Nobody has ever said that before. Nobody has ever said, \"Well, we'll approve the deal, but we want a lot of money to go to the Government because by approving the deal, we're making the deal valuable.\" They've never heard of that before. Okay? Can you believe that? Right? Hard to believe.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWell, we're going to find out about that. We're looking into that from the standpoint of ByteDance. We don't like that. I mean, just conceptually, I can tell you I don't like that. That has not been told to me yet. That has been reported, but it hasn't been told to me. It could be very accurate reporting for a change. So if that's the case, I'm not going to be happy with that—assuming that ByteDance is China, which I think it probably is.\nWell, the question was asked to me about if you have violent demonstrations: Yes, we will put it down very, very quickly if there is. Absolutely.\nAnd I think the American public wants to see that.\nOAN. Yes, please. Go ahead.\nNo, just to finish—look, if there's any kind of demonstration or violence, there will be nothing that interferes with this project—product—this vote. There's going to be nothing.\nThe biggest problem we have right now are the ballots. Millions of ballots going out; that's the biggest problem. When you talk about other countries, whether it's China, Russia, or many others that get mentioned, they're in a much better position with these paper ballots to do something than they would ever be under the old system. And that's our biggest problem.\nOur biggest threat to this election is Governors from opposing parties controlling ballots, millions of ballots. To me, that's a much bigger threat than foreign countries, because much of the stuff coming out about foreign countries turned out to be untrue.\nWhat is true is that many elections have taken place over the last year and a half, using this ballot system. They've been off by 5 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent; I think I read one at 40 percent—40 percent. And these are small, easy-to-control elections.\nThis whole ballot system where you can send it in, and it's not even requested—we're not talking about it solicited; they're unsolicited ballots, and they're sent in—is very dangerous for our country. And you know who knows that better than anybody? The Democrats. Look at what happened in Manhattan, where they had this kind of an election, and it was so fraudulent that it should never have been allowed to be called.\nWe could have 5, 10, 15, 20 percent off; we could have more than that. The ballots will be stolen. Who knows where they're going. Who knows where they're coming from.\nIt's not just the counting of the ballots, which—by the way, which will take forever. It will take forever. You think November 3? You might not have—I guess, at a certain point, it goes to Congress. You know, at a certain point, it goes to Congress. You know that.\nThis is a disgrace. This is being done on purpose. They know it's no good. They know it's—it's going to be fraudulent. It's going to be fraud all over the place. Who's getting the ballots? Who's sending the ballots? They have people saying you don't need a verified signature. This is a serious threat to our democracy, and the Democrats know that.\nAll we're asking: If you solicit the ballot—you go through a process—you ask for a ballot because you can't be there for a large number of reasons, for whatever—I'm doing it myself. I won't be able to be in Florida. You solicit, and they send it back. You do it, and you send it back. That's a process that you go through. And it's pretty secure. I use the word \"pretty\" secure. I guess nothing is foolproof.\nBut what's pretty close to what—the most foolproof thing, the thing that really works is you go to the ballot box. It's going to be very safe.\nI think by that time, COVID will be even lower. It's going to be very low. It's going to be a very safe process. We did it during World War I. We did it during World War II.\nThe biggest threat to this election is these unsolicited ballots sent out by the millions, controlled by Governors like in Nevada, who is a political person—very political, far beyond being Governor—where they tried to stop you from making a speech, unsuccessfully, but we had to move around a lot, had to move quickly. So the same guy that tried to stop you from making free speech outside—outside, not inside; outside—they forced us inside because of what they did—but outside. This is the guy that's controlling ballots.\nThen you look at Pennsylvania. You look at other places. It is a big threat. And as far as China is concerned and Russia and they say North Korea, they say Iran, they say places. Who knows? Who knows? But they say all these different places.\nThey can make forgeries of these ballots. They can do things that will blow your mind. And the Democrats know it's wrong. They know it's going to end up being a disaster. Just take a look at what's happened. Take a look at what's happened over the last year with this same kind of thing, except in a very small setting with very few ballots going out, so that's much easier; not 53 to 80 million going out. A very small number.\nAnd you know what's happened? Fraud like you've never seen. Missing ballots. Ballots that never showed up. Ballots with bad signatures. Ballots with no signatures. And in the case of Nevada, they don't even want verification of the signature. It's a disgrace.\nNow, the hope for our Nation is: It's before judges. In Pennsylvania, it's before judges. In Nevada, it's before judges. In other places it's before Federal judges. And hopefully, they'll do what they did the other day in Pennsylvania where we had a great victory.\nOpen up your State. It's unconstitutional to close it. Because what they were doing is closing it, and they're closing it for political reasons. It will open on November 4. It will open up right after the election. But they want people to—they want our numbers to be as bad as possible, but the problem is our numbers are so good with or without various States opening up. With or without.\nBut we had a big legal victory, as you know, 3 days ago. A Federal judge told them to open up their State. \"It's unconstitutional what you're doing.\" That's in the case of Pennsylvania.\nNow the big cases are going to be the cases on these unsolicited ballots. And we'll see what happens.\nAll right. OAN, please.\nYes, we don't want to see that. We've been very strong on that. We're getting reports in. Over the next 2 or 3 days, we'll know very accurately what the story is, and we'll then take action one way or the other.\nGo ahead.\nWorld Trade Organization/China-U.S. Trade\nWell, I have real questions about it. Look, the U.S.—we just won a seven-and-a-half-billion-dollar lawsuit, which—nobody used to sue before I came along, you know—or they used to lose them every single time. Now they haven't been losing them.\nBut we're getting reports on the WTO. It's not good. Never been good to us. The WTO, as far as I'm concerned, was created to suck money and jobs out of the United States to the benefit of China and other countries—that's what my opinion is—whether it was created or it just turned out to be that way.\nBut the World Trade Organization has been not good for the United States. It's been good for everybody else, but it's not been good. It was a method, in my opinion, of taking advantage of the United States. So we're looking into what happened, and we'll let—we'll get back to you fast.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr./Coronavirus Vaccine Development and Distribution\nI think he made a mistake. Yes, but we didn't—I didn't go into any great—I was very surprised to hear it. It doesn't really matter.\nHere's what does matter: We're all set to distribute immediately. As soon as that vaccine comes out that's safe and good and works—whether it's Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, or anybody else—we are ready to distribute it very rapidly. As Scott said and as our team knows—and they're ready. And that could be on—it could be in October, sometime in October or November. I don't think it's going to be much later than that. But I think it could be sometime in October. We're ready to move, and it will be a very full distribution.\nNo, I didn't tell him anything. I said, \"What happened?\" And I got the impression that he didn't realize he said what he might have said. I didn't see him say it.\nBut if that's what he said, it's a mistake because here's—so, ready? We're ready to distribute immediately to a vast section of our country and then beyond, because we want to help other countries also. But we're ready to distribute immediately.\nKaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN], we're focused on high-risk, but we're going to focus also on general public very much. But we are—our immediate aim is elderly people, and especially elderly people with heart, diabetes problems.\nBut we will have it—this is—we're not looking at a small distribution program; we're looking at distributing to the whole United States with an immediate focus of the elderly.\nNow, under no circumstance, will it be as late as the doctor said. But I think that, frankly, if he analyzes—you know, they hit him with that question. He said that. We are ready at a much faster level than what he said. We will have rapid distribution. We're set up—our military and others are set up to do it, and we think it could even start taking place in October, but certainly, during November, December would be the latest. Because, based on what we're hearing, results are—based on what I'm hearing, results are very good. So we'll see what happens.\nWell, what I was—what I was saying to him—no, that was a long time ago when I said that. I didn't—we weren't set up at that time.\nWell, how many months ago? When was the statement made?\nBy the way, I read the book last night, very rapidly because it was very boring. I read it. And if you see what I said, I said a lot of really good things. I mean, for the most part, people like to turn it around, but I said really good things in that book.\nAnd as an example, he doesn't cover—I told him what we're doing in the Middle East, and we're doing it in an entirely different way. And that's not covered in his book. The whole thing isn't covered in his book.\nAnd one thing I will say—and I respect the press for this one, which was interesting—almost universally, we've been praised for the deal that we made yesterday with Israel and with, you know, the two very important countries in the Middle East. And U.A.E., in particular, where it's a very powerful group. It's a warrior country. It's led by a great warrior and a man who's highly respected. And if you take a look at that and Bahrain and Israel making a deal—and I will tell you, we have at least four or five others that want to come in. They would have come in yesterday. I talked to two of them yesterday, and they're ready to trot.\nAnd I think you're going to have a whole level of peace without blood all over the sand. Nobody was shot. Nobody was killed. We killed hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East. It's all—it's been—I always say, it's the bloodiest sand anywhere in the world, and it didn't have to be that way. The single worst decision our country ever made was to go into the Middle East. Not only the millions of people killed—and I include people on both sides. You know, some people say, \"Oh, you shouldn't say that.\" I'll say it: \"on both sides.\" Such a horrible thing was done. Such a horrible mistake was made. We're doing this a different way. So we have those two countries. We have at least five that we're negotiating with right now. And you know, you can only negotiate with so many. I think they're all going to come in.\nI think, ultimately, the Palestinians are going to come in. These are all the people that are funding them. You know, I stopped funding the Palestinians fairly early on, because they were saying bad things about our country. I said, \"Well, you mean we're giving them $750 million a year, and they're saying all bad things about our country?\" So I stopped funding them very early on. But they get funded by other very rich countries. To them, it's like a speck; it's nothing. But they get funded.\nAnd—but I think now that these countries—these very rich countries are part of the deal, and they're going—you'll see, over the next fairly short period of time, other countries will come in. I think Saudi Arabia, ultimately, will come in too. I think getting Saudi Arabia will be great. But I think Saudi Arabia—this is my feeling; it's not based on knowledge, other than a couple of conversations I had with the King. But Saudi Arabia, I think, will be coming in too.\nAnd you'll end up in—with peace in the Middle East. And nobody thought it could be done, and nobody thought it could be done this way.\nI went to some very smart people.\nI went to some people in the Middle East, and they said: \"You'll never be able to do it. It's not possible to make peace.\" Well, now they're saying to me, \"Nobody ever thought of doing this.\" They all thought you make the deal first with the Palestinians; it had to be that way.\nAnd I will say the resistance was: Some countries didn't want to do it unless the Palestinians were there first. That was just a psychological thing more than anything else, but they were wrong. Those countries—the people—our great representatives that have been doing this for 35 years that were telling me how to do it—but they all failed. They were Clinton's administration, they were in Bush, they were in Obama—all these great, brilliant people. They're all telling me how to do it, and I said, \"They're wrong.\" And I guess I was right. And——\nAnd when you see—let me just—well, let's talk—finish this.\nWhen you see the countries that will be coming—a very short period of time; not talking in a long period of time—all of the countries that will be coming in, just like you saw—Bahrain yesterday, and U.A.E., and I can think of, I mean, at least five that are going to be quick and easy. Others will be quick and easy also, once the five comes—come in.\nSo you're going to have something; you're going to peace in the Middle East. And we want to get out, you know. We want to—our soldiers are largely coming home. I said they're—the endless wars; the ridiculous, endless wars.\nAnd I will say this: If I didn't withdraw our country from that horrible Iran nuclear deal—that horrible, stupid deal, where President Obama paid $150 billion for nothing and gave $1.8 billion in cash—$1.8 billion. You know what that is? $1.8 billion in cash. That's more impressive than the $150 billion paid normally.\nBut he gave all this money, all of this—all of these chips that we had. We had these chips, and he gave them all away. And we got nothing. And you know, it was a short-term deal. It would be practically expiring now. It would be practically—it starts to expire, actually, right now. But it would practically be—and there is no way we will let Iran have a nuclear weapon. Just remember that. There's no way that's going to happen.\nWell, the vaccine—at the time, I thought it might take that period of time, but we've stepped it up very substantially.\nAnd now—I mean, I'm just telling you the—this is just what it is. We've been able to step it up very, very rapidly. I never thought we could have a vaccine as quickly as we did, but I freed it up. I freed up the FDA. Dr. Hahn has done a great job. And they're ready to approve something when they come in.\nThe other thing that's happening that's very different is—you look at a company like Pfizer, a great company—really, one of the great companies of the world. Johnson & Johnson. They're all great companies. They're doing a lot of testing at a very rapid rate that nobody has ever seen anything like it. You know, they're out in third—they're in the third level of trial. And I think that you're going to see things that are amazing.\nWhen I made statements like that—that's an old statement. When I made statements like that, I had no idea that we could produce as well as we're producing. But only because of what I've done with the FDA and other things can we come up with numbers like that. We're lucky that we don't have to, because that was considered fast.\nIf this were a—an administration from the past—and I think I can say \"far beyond Obama,\" if—it was other administrations also—you wouldn't have a vaccine for 2½, 3 years. And we're going to have a vaccine within, at most, a couple of months.\nOkay?\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News].\n——something like that.\nSomething like that. Yes, I like the larger amount. I've said that, you know. Some of the Republicans disagree, but I think I can convince them to go along with it, because I like the larger number.\nI want to see people get money. I want to see—it wasn't their fault that this happened. It was China's fault, you know? People say: \"Oh, maybe you shouldn't say that. That's not nice.\" It was China's fault. So I'd like to see the larger number. Yes, I would like to see it. There are some things I disagree with, but I'm sure they can be negotiated.\nNow, I heard Nancy Pelosi said she doesn't want to leave until we have an agreement. She's come a long way. That's great. If she said that, she's come a long way.\nI agree with her. We should have an agreement. People should be helped, and they should be helped as rapidly as possible. And I think it's going to happen. I think it's very important.\nSo the Problem Solvers came up with—it's a group of people in Congress, as you know. You know them all. I know them all. They're very good people. I guess you'd consider them dead center. But in many cases, they're not. They're left. They're right. But they came up with this idea, and I think they're well on their way to suggesting some pretty good things.\nI agree with a lot of it.\nI think the things I don't agree we can probably negotiate. But I think we've made some progress over the last week, and I think it was positive that they came out with that report.\nWell, not that proposal, but we're getting closer. We're getting closer.\nI do like a lot of money getting sent to people that really were—really were hurt unnecessarily by China, because they could have stopped it. They stopped it from going into their country. They could have stopped it from coming to our country and from going to Europe and from going to the rest of the world, 188 different countries from all over the world.\nThe mask.\nAnd to masks.\nOkay, number one, it's not more effective, by any means, than a vaccine. And I called him about that. Those were the two things I discussed with him. And I believe that if you ask him, he would probably say that he didn't understand the question. Because I said to him—I asked him those two questions: the one question which we covered and the mask question.\nAnd I was inaccurately covered, because I was on with George last night—George Stephanopoulos. And I enjoyed it. I think people enjoyed it. I got—you know, a lot of people said very good things about the show. I hope they did well. But they said a lot of good things about the show, but they always cut my sentences off. You know, they cut it off.\nOn masks, the masks have problems too. And I talked about the masks about to be handled very gently, very carefully. I see that, in restaurants, they have people with masks, and they're playing around with their mask, and they have it—their fingers are in their mask, and then they're serving with plates. I mean, I think there's a lot of problems with masks.\nNo, vaccine is much more effective than the masks. And if we get the vaccine, we have—added to the fact that our numbers are going way down. You know, you see the numbers. I'm just reading you statistics that are from wherever they get them. But they're very highly qualified statistics.\nBut no, the mask is not as important as the vaccine. The mask, perhaps, helps. Don't forget: A lot of people didn't like the concept of masks initially. Dr. Fauci didn't like them, and a lot of people didn't. And I'm not knocking anybody, because I understand both sides of the argument.\nBut when I called up Robert today, I said to him, \"What's with the masks?\" He said, \"I think I answered that question incorrectly.\" I think maybe he misunderstood it. I mean, you know, you have two questions; maybe he misunderstood both of them. But the answer to the one is, it's going to be a much faster distribution than he said. Maybe he's not aware of the distribution process. It's not really his thing as much as it would be, let's say, mine. But the distribution is going to be much faster.\nAs far as the mask is concerned, I hope that the vaccine is going to be a lot more beneficial than the masks, because people have used the masks. But when I looked at that chart that we put up, if you look, you know, we write—if you do the good job—they had, I guess, 240,000. But if you do the good—if it worked out well—now, look, one death is too much. One death is too much; should have never happened. But the lower level was at that 240,000—between a hundred and something and 240,000.\nAs far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake.\nNo, they may be effective.\nWell, I'm tested, and I'm sometimes surprised when I see somebody sitting and—like, with Joe. Joe feels very safe in a mask. I don't know, maybe he doesn't want to expose his face. I don't know what's going on. He'll be way away from people, nowhere near people—there will be nobody with him. He doesn't draw any crowds. He'll have circles. These big circles. They'll be way far away. There's no reason for him to have masks on.\nWe get tested—I'm tested; I have people tested. When people come into the Oval Office, it's like a big deal. No matter who they are—if they're heads of countries, they all get tested. So I'm in sort of a different position. And maybe if I wasn't in that position, I'd be wearing it more. But I've worn masks. And especially I like to wear them when I'm in hospital. Not for me so much as for other people. Okay? Thanks. Yes.\nWell, he didn't say \"minorities\"; he said \"minorities and senior citizens.\"\nYes.\nWell, I'll go first, because of your question—I appreciate your question. And yes, we've had a tremendous drop in poverty for all people in our Nation, but in particular for African Americans. And that statistic came in. And it's because the African American community, the Black community has had the lowest—the best employment numbers that we've ever had—both employment and unemployment, depending on how you want to define it.\nBut we've had the best employment numbers we've ever had. Now, we had the greatest employment in the country ever, almost 160 million people. We've never been close to that number, but we were just 6 months ago.\nAnd yes, the—I'm very proud of the numbers. African Americans, Hispanic Americans—they had the best numbers they've ever had, by far—both employment and unemployment, depending on definition.\nThank you very much for that question. Scott, do you want to answer that too?\nI will say, this is a phenomena that only happened when they realized that we may very well have the vaccine prior to a certain very important date, namely November 3. Once they heard that, the Democrats started—just to show you how bad the intention is, they started knocking the vaccine. Had nothing to do with a vaccine, it was totally made up. It's all disinformation.\nJust like they put an ad in about football. Just like they put—with respect to me. I'm the one that got football back. And I was always against them going out. It was ridiculous that Big Ten and now, hopefully, Pac-10 [Pac-12]* goes back.\nAnd I say that, just like—even worse, they put out a totally fake ad, totally made-up story. It was a made-up story by a third-rate magazine, where the head guy—I guess, the head person—I have no idea who he is; I don't know him, but he's friends with Obama and Clinton. So they made up this horrible story, and then they did ads. Well, they made up this story too.\nThis story is very simple: They started knocking the vaccine as soon as they heard that this actually may come out prior to election. Now, it may or may not, but it will be within a matter of weeks. It will be within a matter of weeks from November. It's ready to go and it's ready to—for massive distribution to everybody—with a focus, again, on seniors.\nAnd I will say, also, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, we are doing, at my suggestion—because they have had a difficult problem there—we are doing more testing there and finer testing. We have our great apparatus there.\nBut we—when you look at what we've done on testing, in terms of the technology and the amount, it's been really amazing. In fact, I think we're going to crack a hundred million tests very soon, in the very near future. We're going to be cracking a hundred million tests.\nNow what that does do is, it shows up more cases. If we didn't test, we wouldn't have cases. You would have no cases. Other countries, they don't test; they don't have cases. And then they say, \"Oh, the United States\"—well—but we're proud of it, because it shows where there may be a problem, and it helps people. But we're doing tremendous testing at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And that was a suggestion I made, and I think it's a good suggestion.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nGo ahead.\nNo, he's contradicting himself.\nI think he misunderstood the questions.\nYou know what I think?\nI think he misunderstood—I told you, I don't have to go through this. I think he misunderstood the questions. But I'm telling you, here's the bottom line: Distribution is going to be very rapid. He may not know that. Maybe he's not aware of that, and maybe he's not dealing with the military, et cetera, like I do. Distribution is going to be very rapid. And the vaccine is going to be very powerful. It's going to solve a tremendous problem. It's going to be very powerful.\nBecause of the great job we've done. Because of the great things we've done in other fields, also. Because of the fact that we created ventilators. We built ventilators by the thousands and now we're supplying to the world.\nBecause of all of the incredible work we've done for Governors, who are, on every call, saying: \"This is incredible. This is great. This is great.\" Sometimes, they're not quite as friendly at a news conference when you have people covering it.\nBut we have done a phenomenal job on COVID-19, as they like to call it; I call it other things. But we have done a phenomenal job.\nI get calls from other people in other countries. They can't believe the job we've done. And then they'll say, \"Is there any way that you could get us ventilators?\" I say, \"How many do you need?\" \"One thousand ventilators.\" I said, \"We'll be able to take care of it.\" We're making thousands of ventilators—very complex, very expensive, very difficult thing to make. We're making thousands a month. The cupboard was bare when I got here.\nAnd I will tell you, our distribution is going to be very rapid and very—it's going to be all-encompassing. We are going to have a focus on certain groups that have problems—senior citizens, et cetera—but it's a very powerful—it's a—it's going to be very powerful distribution. It's going to cover everybody, and it's going to cover them rapidly.\nI don't know whether or not the doctor knows that, how much he covers. But I called him because I said, \"Why did you say that long?\" He wasn't that aware of it. And the other one was the mask. The vaccine is going to have tremendous power. It's going to be extremely strong. It's going to be extremely successful. We're not going to have a problem.\nAnd the mask may help, and I hope it helps, and I think it probably does. But again, the mask is a mixed bag. There are some people—professionals—Scott, you would know a lot of them—but there are some people that don't like the mask, because of the touchiness and the touching, and then you're touching everything else. They have—they feel that masks have problems.\nSo anyway, go ahead, in the back, please.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield, Jr.\nYes, I—I do. I do. I do.\nHe, sort of, I think, maybe misunderstood a question. But we're beyond that now. We're really in final stages of vaccines. We're getting ready to go phase one on distribution. And I think it may come out even sooner than you think.\nI think the vaccine is going to be even better than people thought originally. I think people are going to be really surprised at the success of the vaccine. I think it's going to be a tremendous success. And we're fighting a very powerful party—with a poor candidate, in my opinion—but we're fighting a very, very powerful party, and they're partners with the media, and—because they're working together very closely.\nAnd they only started hitting on the vaccine—when they hit on the vaccine, they only hit on it when they realize that: \"Wow, this is amazing. They may have it even before the election.\" All of a sudden, they didn't like the vaccine so much.\nYes, in the back, please. Go ahead.\nYou're going to—I cannot hear you, I'm sorry.\nAbout today?\nSay it.\nOh, I see. About staff? You mean about——\nI heard about it this morning, at a very small level. Yes. I heard about this morning.\nI don't know. We can have a report to you if you feel it's necessary.\nBut it's a small—it's—last night I heard about it for the first time. And it's a small number of cases. Maybe it's not even cases.\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.Yes.\nWhat is it?\nPress Secretary McEnany.There—yes, but we're not going to confirm the identities of the individuals.\nYes, that's okay.\nPress Secretary McEnany.Yes, but it did not affect the event, and press was not around the individual.\nAnd it's not anybody that was near me.\nA very—from what I heard, a very small number. I think you can probably give the number out later on when you find out what it might be.\nPress Secretary McEnany.Yes, it's one person.\nOne person?\nIt was one person. Okay.\nIt was one person. That's—I mean, so not too much. Not a person that I was associated with.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1262"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-18", "Text": "Thank you very much, everyone. So a lot of work has been going on with respect to the vaccines, very successful work, I might add. We have three great, great companies doing somewhat different variations, but they're all looking very good.\nFrom the beginning of the China virus, all nations have understood that our top priority must be to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible to end the pandemic and get life back to normal. The successful vaccine will not only save millions of lives, it will put an end to the restrictions and some of the things that go on and have to go on in the meantime.\nToday I want to discuss the historic progress we're making to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time. And there's never been anything like this ever. In our history, there's never been any—in history, period—world history.\nSince January, America's brilliant doctors and scientists have been working around the clock. These are the best medical minds in the world, by far. And the vaccines are going through the gold standard of clinical trials, and very heavy emphasis placed on safety. Three vaccines are already in the final stage.\nJoe Biden's antivaccine theories are putting a lot of lives at risk. And they're only doing it for political reasons; it's very foolish. It's part of their war to try and discredit the vaccine, now that they know that we essentially have it. We'll be announcing it fairly soon.\nAs part of Operation Warp Speed, my administration is manufacturing all of the most promising vaccines in advance. And actually, it will be fairly long in advance. As soon as a vaccine is approved, the administration will deliver it to the American people immediately. Distribution will begin within 24 hours after notice.\nAnd the general—I think those are the words specifically you wanted us to use?\nWithin 24 hours, you're all set to go. And massive amounts will be delivered through our great military. And the general is one of our best, and he is ready to go.\nWe'll have manufactured at least 100 million vaccine doses before the end of the year and likely much more than that. Hundreds of millions of doses will be available every month. And we expect to have enough vaccines for every American by April.\nAnd, again, I'll say that even at that later stage, the delivery will go—as fast as it comes, they can deliver. They're very good. Best—I think probably the best in the world.\nThe estimates I'm providing today are based on the manufacturing that's in process, and that's in process immediately, right now. We've already exceeded our ambitious goals.\nUnder the Defense Production Act, contracts that we've secured—we may even get far above these numbers. And numbers that I'm telling you today, I think we'll exceed them very, very substantially. And I think that also includes distribution. I think distribution will go even quicker than most people think. I'm relying on our military. Everything I've done with our military, it's worked out very well. In a short time, we'll have a safe and effective vaccine, and we'll defeat the virus. Interestingly, as I was saying that go \"very well,\" just like what we did with our military with respect to ISIS went very well, long ahead of schedule. They have been incredible in working with me.\nLet's go to Puerto Rico, because Puerto Rico has been hit very, very hard by a lot of different storms, and they're great people. It's a great place. I know it well. Great place.\nToday my administration is making the largest emergency relief award in history to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid and educational system. We're awarding $13 billion to permanently repair and replace thousands of miles of transmission and distribution lines that should have been done many years ago.\nThis was beyond even the storms. This was just age and a lot of the salt. The salt from that ocean is a killer for electrical stations and power generation systems. But, on top of the salt, you had these massive storms or hurricanes come in. And Maria, in particular, was a disaster.\nBut for many years, they've been trying to get this done, and they haven't had the political will power in Washington to get it done. So we're going to get it done for them.\nWe're also going to be bringing back very, very major amounts of medical work. You know, we used to have pharmaceutical manufacturing at levels that few places had, and a lot of it has left Puerto Rico. And we're going to bring that back, especially now, since our emphasis is going to be making our product. So we're going to bring pharmaceutical manufacturing back to Puerto Rico. A lot of it left over the years, over a long period of time. It's been leaving and going to China and other places. So we're bringing all of that back.\nThis was done in previous administrations. I'd like to just point out, we've done more for Puerto Rico than anybody. And this is just an example of it, but we've done more for Puerto Rico, by far, than anybody.\nWe'll also be launching a major effort to repair and renovate the schools across the island. Following Hurricane Maria, my administration immediately deployed the full power of the Federal Government to bring the electric grid back on line so they could at least temporarily—and it certainly wasn't a permanent fix; it was ripped to shreds. But a lot of that was ripped to shreds long before even the storm came in. For many, many years, they've been trying to do it. But we wanted to restore water supplies. And we did make emergency repairs to critical infrastructure, which we took care of, and saved countless lives, which we did.\nFEMA's response in Puerto Rico included the longest sustained air mission, supplying food and water, in American history. We supplied it for long after the hurricane was gone. The largest disaster commodity distribution mission in U.S. history and the largest sea bridge operation in Federal disaster aid in U.S. history.\nMy administration has also prepositioned vast quantities of relief supplies for the future disasters. Unfortunately, Puerto Rico is in the way of a lot of different storms, a lot of hurricanes. And the island is now stocked with nearly 8 times as much drinking water and 13 times as much food as it had before I took office. So they're ready to go if something should happen.\nThey got brushed by a storm recently, but they're in a good position. So we're going to bring back medical distribution and manufacturing to Puerto Rico and at a level far greater than it was before.\nAnd it's been emptied out. It's been largely—it largely left the island for many years. At one point, it was a—it was the talk of the world, and now it's the talk of the world in a different way. We're bringing it back. So we're going to be bringing it back from various other parts of the world. It's going to Puerto Rico. And I think that's going to be very exciting for the people. And we're undertaking the largest Federal investment in Puerto Rico's history. So you have a lot of—I have a lot of friends in Puerto Rico, and I told them about it—asked them about it. \"Conceptually, what do you think?\" And they're very excited.\nI just want to say, by contrast, Biden has devastated the island of Puerto Rico. He—Joe Biden, what he's done to Puerto Rico, meaning the past administration, is devastating.\nIn 1996, Biden voted to eliminate a critical tax provision that had allowed Puerto Rico to become a dominant player in global pharmaceutical manufacturing. That's what happened. When Biden voted to repeal this provision, the pharmaceutical industry was ripped out of Puerto Rico. All incentive to stay there was taken away, and all of the jobs went to China and other places, but mostly to China. That's what happened. This was done with a vote of Biden. This was even before the Obama administration. This was early on. But so sad that that was done.\nAnd then, Obama came in, and it got worse. So, for the people of Puerto Rico: They were a disaster for you. And I have to say, in a very nice way, a very respectful way, I'm the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. Nobody even close.\nBut as a result, the island's economy, under the previously mentioned names, it just absolutely cratered. Biden's vote also left the United States at the mercy of foreign suppliers for essential medicines, putting our national security and our health at risk.\nWe had a tremendous industry potentially going to Puerto Rico, and they just absolutely cut it short with bad votes and took all the incentive away, and it went to other places—faraway lands. So they really, in a sense, were voting to destroy Puerto Rico. And we're bringing Puerto Rico back, and we'll have it done fairly quickly.\nAnd the $13 billion is a—that's a tremendous amount of money, but it's a very important amount. And I think you're going to see something terrific. And it's very exciting. To me, what—the most exciting is bringing the whole pharmaceutical industry back.\nWe've spoken to various companies, and they're willing to go there. They want to have a little bit of help, but they're willing to go to Puerto Rico. And Puerto Rico is going to be very exciting, what's going to happen. They were on the verge of doing it, and they took away all the incentives. I don't know how that was allowed to happen, but they allowed it to happen. That was very, very bad for Puerto Rico and the people of Puerto Rico. That was done by Democrats, and a Republican is bringing it back.\nSo, with that, we can take a few questions. And we are, again, very advanced on the vaccine. We think that sometime in the very near future, we'll have it. We're, I would say—I think I can say—years ahead of schedule, what it would be if it were an administration other than this one. It would have been—you would have been years before you ever had anything approved by the FDA.\nJohn [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nBecause what we're doing is, we've been working on it for a long time to get it passed. Very tough to get things past Democrats, where they don't want to see this happen. And they probably, certainly, didn't want to see it happen at this point.\nBut it's a big package. It's a great package. And I think the most exciting part of the package isn't necessarily the billions of dollars; it's going to be what we do with the pharmaceutical industry. We're going to get them back into Puerto Rico. They liked being there, but they changed the tax situation; they ripped it out. So they really ripped apart the island, and we're going to bring it back, John.\nYes, I think that that's probably—well, they can't do anything. Look, the Biden-Harris campaign, what they did—they hurt—you know, I've gone through it. And whether it was President Obama or Vice President Biden, they were a disaster for Puerto Rico. A disaster.\nAnd what we're doing and what we've done—but what we're doing is something that will be fantastic for many years in the future. Bringing back the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturing in Puerto Rico, is what they've wanted for years, and we're doing that, in addition to the $13 billion.\nYes, please.\nSure. And I think we may exceed those numbers, even.\nScott, do you want to discuss that quickly?\nWhite House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas.Sure. As has been said many times——\nWe'd like to beat that number, yes. But we think we will.\nYes, that's—that's on the outer edge. We think we can beat that number very substantially.\nI think it could go quickly. We have great companies talking to us about it. You know about Oracle; you know Microsoft has been involved, and let's see whether or not they're continuing to be involved. Walmart is truly a great company. They are very much involved; they want to do something.\nSo we have some great options, and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy, but have the security that we need. We have to have the total security from China. Just know we're not going to do anything to jeopardize security.\nAt the same time, it's an amazing company and very, very popular. So if we can do a combination of both, I'd be very happy doing that. It could go very quickly though. It could go very, very fast.\nYes, please.\nGo ahead, please.\nOAN.\nWell, they just left my office, as you know, the Oval Office. And we had a very good meeting with the Amir, and I think we understand each other very well. They're very excited about a lot of things that are happening in the Middle East. They are so excited that we signed the first two countries, and I think they'll end up fairly quickly being a part of it.\nI have, I would say, seven or eight countries that want to be a part of it without even working very easily, very quickly. Nobody thought this would happen. And not only is it happening, it's happening rather easily. We discussed that very briefly, because that's an easy one. Believe it or not, that whole thing is now a beautiful puzzle that's coming together very nicely.\nBut we are talking to them and others about various aspects of the Middle East. The Middle East is straightening out with all this happening. You know, we've brought a lot of our troops back. A lot of them are coming back in the very near future.\nWe're out of Syria, other than we kept the oil. I kept the oil. And we have troops guarding the oil. Other than that, we're out of Syria. We took them off the border between Syria and Turkey. We had a lot of troops on the border. Ultimately, we got it down to 50, and I thought they were in great danger when you have two armies sitting there looking to fight, and you have 50 people in the middle. I don't care who you are, even if you're the U.S., those 50 people are in great danger. We took them out.\nBut we had a lot of troops on the border, and we took them out. I said, \"Look, they've been fighting on their border for 200 years and a lot longer than that, under different names, and they can continue to do that.\" That's not for us; we're guarding our own borders. We're doing very well on our southern border, as an example.\nSo we're out of Syria, except we kept the oil, and we'll make a determination. We'll probably be dealing with the Kurds and the oil and see what it all ends up. But we'll be out.\nAnd very importantly, we're down to very few soldiers in Iraq, and we're down—we'll be down very shortly over the next couple of weeks to 4,000—less than 4,000 in Afghanistan. And then we'll make that final determination a little bit later on.\nWe're dealing very well with the Taliban. They're very tough, they're very smart, they're very sharp. But you know, it's been 19 years, and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness. And we really served as a police force, because if we wanted to do what we had to do, we would have fought a lot differently than they have over the 19 years. They didn't fight it properly. They were police, okay? They're not police; they're soldiers. So there's a difference. The police—nobody has more respect for police than I do, but they have to do their own policing.\nSo we're having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It's been public. And—but we'll be down to—very shortly, we'll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. And so we'll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen—certain things have to be fulfilled. But 19 years is a long time, 8,000 miles away. Nineteen years is a long time.\nAnd the Middle East—the whole Middle East equation, if you look at what's happened, if you've looked at the stupidity of decisions that were made, including the deal that was made—I mean, take a look at what happened with Iran. Had that deal stayed and had I not broken that deal, you could have never done the deal that I'm doing now where all the countries are pouring in.\nAnd I had two calls this morning with countries; they want to know, \"When can we go into the deal?\" They want to go. It's not that we're giving them anything. They want security, they want peace, and they're really tired of fighting. It's incredible. They're tired of fighting. They've been fighting for so many years. They're tired of fighting. Thank you very much.\nWell, that's true. That's true. They have been.\nBecause we're building that up as a great medical pharmaceutical manufacturing area where, you know, we're going to be taking back a lot of the business that we let go for years. And we're bringing—we're going to bring it back. They were very good at it. They did a fantastic job, but they destroyed it with their tax policy. They made it impossible for people to stay, so people went to China, mostly, and to other countries. Puerto Rico has been very corrupt in terms of its politicians. You see that. They're one after another. It's been unbelievably corrupt, and we're studying that and working on that. And we think we have a good group of people who are working very well with the politicians right now.\nBut I think more exciting than the dollars—and you have to do something with respect to their grid; their grid is a disaster, their generators are wiped out. And they've been wiped out for years, long before Maria came. They've been wiped out for years. So if we can build Puerto Rico back into a pharmaceutical manufacturing area, we're going to designate it as such. I think it will be unbelievable for Puerto Rico, unbelievable for the people of Puerto Rico, and we can make it very successful.\nOh, I do. Not at all of them, no. I think—I think I have—yes, in many cases, I do.\nI think we have a bigger problem with China than we have with Russia. I think China is a far bigger problem. And I said, \"Well, that's okay if you want to think about Russia, but what about China?\" I think that's appropriate.\nI thought that the definition of Antifa was an absolutely incorrect definition, so I speak up. I like to speak up. I have fantastic people. That's why we're able to make these great trade deals; that's why we're able to do things like we're doing today; that's why the country has done so well.\nThe country has done numbers like nobody had we not had the China plague come in, if that virus didn't come in—\"the plague,\" I call it—if the plague from China didn't come in, the numbers we had were not only record setting, they were beyond anything anyone has ever seen in any country, frankly.\nNow, we closed it up, and now we're opening it up. And by the way, the Democrats ought to open up their States and they ought them up fast, Jon. The faster, the better, because they're hurting their people. A lot of damage done with these extended shutdowns. But we saved millions of lives by doing it the way we did it. And now we're opening it up, and you see the kind of numbers—the manufacturing numbers; you see the retail numbers; you look at the employment numbers. They're setting records. It's an incredible thing that's happening.\nHad the plague not come in, we would have been right now at a level that nobody has ever seen before. Nobody has ever seen. But even before, it was at the highest stock market, best unemployment numbers and employment numbers. We were up to 160 million people—just short of 160 million—people employed. We were never close to a number like that, and now we're doing it again. And next year, we will have a great economic year. I think one of our best.\nYes, please. Go ahead, please.\nI don't know. I don't run it, to be honest.\nThat's run—as you know, that's run by a Commission, and they run it. I think, frankly, if they would raise the price of packaging, you'd end up making a lot of money, or breaking even, or doing something.\nThe Post Office has been a mess for many, many generations, but for certainly decades. And it loses a lot of money. It's always lost a lot of money. And one of the reasons it loses a lot of money now is that it's delivering all these packages. And every time they deliver a package, they lose $3 a package or whatever the number may be.\nSo I would suggest that they raise the price of packages. And you might get something where it loses very little, or maybe broke even, or maybe even made some money. Would—can you imagine a thing like that? And whether it's Amazon or any of the other internet delivery services, if you did that, you'd have a whole different Post Office. So hopefully, they'll be doing that.\nIn the meantime, I know so many people in the Postal System, and I've known them over the years. They're incredible people. And they're very secure. They're going to be very secure.\nYou know, the problem they have with the ballots—not the Post Office—the problem they have with the ballots is the people sending the ballots and the people counting the ballots. And who are they sending them to? Where are they being sent? Are they being sent to the wrong areas? Are they not being sent at all?\nThere'll be tremendous corruption if they don't do something about it. Now, one big hope is that we're in front of numerous Federal judges in Nevada. We're in front in Pennsylvania, as you know. We're in front in Michigan. We have numerous court cases out there that are very well advanced, and you'll start seeing decisions. Just like we won the case on opening up Pennsylvania. That was a great decision by a judge that came down 2 days ago, and that was a very important decision.\nSo—but we have a lot of very important decisions coming down on this, on the scam of unsolicited ballots, where they're sending out tens of millions of ballots to everybody—people that didn't expect them. People are getting inundated with ballots—they'll be showered with ballots.\nEverybody in this room knows it's a scam. Okay? Everybody in this room, even Jon. Don't say it, Jon, because——\nIt's a scam.\n——at a level—they are never going to be able to count them. Let me ask you——\nThey do, but that's different. That's called \"solicited.\" When you solicit, when you go out—it's called \"absentee\" or \"solicit.\" When you go out and you request a ballot—you want to say, \"I want to vote because I can't be in Florida or I can't be someplace.\" You request. So you're sending something in, it's handled professionally, they send it back—it's a whole thing. That's much different than \"unsolicited,\" when you get millions of ballots. I heard numbers like 80 million ballots.\nNow, just this week, they had another one—another one of the disasters that took place—an election. But look at what happened in New Jersey. And they had another one in New Jersey—very, very bad—different than Paterson. Look at what happened in New York with Carolyn—your Congressman—Murphy.\nMaloney.\nCarolyn Maloney. Look at that. I mean, look at that race. Carolyn Maloney had a race; it was a disaster. Ballots are missing; ballots are fraud.\nThese are small races. These are—look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened at various other parts of the country, even over the last short period of a while. And these aren't 80 million or 50 million or 20 million votes; these are small elections. These are congressional elections where, in theory, it's easy.\nSo what's going to happen on November 3 when somebody is leading and they say, \"Well, look, we haven't counted the ballots; we have millions of ballots to count\"? It's a disaster. Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it's a disaster. And I don't expect people here to say—although some people will. Some people would say it. Everyone knows. You don't even have to know politics to know.\nAnd this has nothing to do with Post Office, by the way. Where are these ballots going? Who's sending them? Who's signing them?\nYou have—in Nevada, you have a Governor that signs something where he doesn't even want verification of the signature. So what does that mean? So he doesn't even want verification of the signature.\nSo I think it's going to be a terrible time for this country. And we're counting on Federal judges to do a great constitutional job when they are—they're right now analyzing it—many, many Federal judges—many, like, I think five or six—but many Federal judges.\nI can tell you, in Pennsylvania, big; in Nevada, very big. I believe it's in front of a judge in Michigan. We have—a lot of judges have not yet ruled on this. But if it's ruled in a different manner or it's ruled where these millions and millions of unsolicited—people that aren't even asking. There's such a difference. You write in, you ask, they send it to you, you sign it, you send it back—that's perfect. That's \"absentee.\"\nThere's nothing like going to the voter booth, by the way—nothing—where they check you as you go in. There's nothing like that. But that's absentee; that's okay.\nBut this scam of sending millions and millions of ballots—and you know who knows this better than I do? The Democrats. They know it's going to be a mess. They know it's going—there are going to be millions of missing ballot or tremendous numbers of missing ballots.\nYou could be talking about large percentages of these ballots are going to be missing. There's going to be fraud. It's a disaster.\nAnd everybody—and it'd be a lot easier for me not to bring it up. But everybody knows I'm right. And you don't have to know a lot about elections. You don't have to know a lot about politics. This is going to be the scam of all time.\nAnd hopefully, the Federal judges—all respected, all highly respected—hopefully, they'll be able to see this clearly and stop it.\nOkay, thank you very much, everybody.\nSo I want to congratulate Puerto Rico.\nAnd I think you're going to have a great period of time. I think you're going to see a rebuilding of Puerto Rico.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1263"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-23", "Text": "Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today Johnson and Johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials. This is record time. This is the fourth vaccine candidate in the United States to reach the final stage of trial. So we have four candidates already at a very late date. \"Late\" being a very positive word, in this case.\nEarlier this year, Johnson and Johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by September. But due to our support under Operation Warp Speed, and to some of the incredible scientists involved, they've reached phase three trials by September, far ahead of schedule. We encourage Americans to enroll in the vaccine trial. It's not only interesting, it will be a terrific thing for our country. We encourage everybody to enroll, as many people as we can.\nToday my administration announced that we are awarding $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 States to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents, and we want to do that the instant it is approved, not the following day, but the following moment. And so we're going to be doing that, and we'll be distributing, getting it ready, because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out.\nThrough Operation Warp Speed, we also continue to accelerate lifesaving therapies. We're seeing promising results that our monoclonal antibody treatments—which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly—we're finding can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70 percent.\nBy cutting the redtape and unleashing America's medical genius, we've reduced the fatality rate 85 percent since April. For individuals under 50, they have a 99.98-percent rate of survival from the China virus. And that's a number that's been really increasing substantially with time.\nAs children go back to school, we're encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread. Brown University conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 States and found that only 0.076 percent of students had confirmed cases of the virus—that's a tiny percentage—and only 0.15 percent of teachers had confirmed cases.\nPatients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6 percent of all emergency room visits, the lowest since the pandemic began—1.6 percent emergency room visits.\nAs far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned, we provided over $21 billion to our nursing homes, and we are really focused on the nursing homes. Everybody, including our Governors—we have Governors who are working very closely with the Task Force and with the Vice President and everybody involved. We've sent rapid-testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes in the country.\nThis week, we're sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure they can test staff regularly. And the staff now is being tested on a very, very powerful and on a regular basis, but very strongly at the finest level, the highest level, and the best tests.\nWe're encouraged that the number of Americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50 percent compared to last year. It's substantially up. The flu, when it's mixed with COVID, or China virus, is going to be very interesting to see what happens. But that can drive numbers. And we just don't know what that will be yet, but you'll have flu numbers, and you'll have some COVID numbers.\nI think we're rounding the turn very much. You see what's happening in Europe, however. They have a very big spike. Countries that we thought were doing well aren't doing well. They had some very big spikes. Very—a very big surge.\nMonths ago, we increased our Nation's procurement of the flu vaccine by 66 percent, and we ask Americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible. It's possible, I would imagine, Scott, that the flu can get mixed up with the virus, and people can think it's the virus when actually it's another flu season coming on. I don't know, it's—I hope they can keep them separate. Can they keep them separate?\nWhite House COVID-19 Pandemic Adviser Scott W. Atlas. We hope so.\nHuh? I doubt they will. [Laughter] It's going to be a very interesting time.\nBut we have a flu season coming up. We've had some flu seasons, which are really massive over the years—over many years. And we have some that are much less so. But it's still significant, so I hope they can separate them, because it's pretty close.\nIn the past 4 months, we've created 10.6 million jobs. We cut unemployment rate nearly in half. The unemployment rate is cut nearly in half. Larry Kudlow is here. He'll be discussing that in a little while. Retail sales are up 121 percent; that's far above what we thought. Manufacturing is up 61 percent; that's above—also above our schedule, and our schedule is a heavy schedule. Automobile production is up six-fold. Homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level in history. That's an amazing statement, Larry, the highest level in history. That means people are thinking good thoughts.\nHome sales are at the highest level in nearly 15 years. Small-business optimism is higher than any time under the last administration, substantially higher. Small-business optimism—higher than at any time over the last—more than the last administration.\nToday I was proud to award nine companies and organizations with the first-ever Pledge to America's Workers Presidential Award. This award recognizes outstanding training programs that are giving Americans the skills to hone a trade and earn a great living. They're great people. Over 400 companies have competed and committed to 16 million training opportunities for the American worker, and it's really been amazing.\nWe've created the fastest economic recovery in American history. You are witnessing it. You are a part of it. Our approach is proscience. Biden's approach is antiscience. If you look, it's—I don't think they know what their approach is, although a lot of it's copied from what we've done.\nBiden opposed the China travel ban and the Europe travel ban. And the strategy that they have was just never-ending lockdowns. We're not locking down. We're actually growing at a rate that we've never experienced before. But they're talking about—if you have a question, just lock it down. We're not doing that, and you can't do that.\nOur plan will crush the virus. And actually, Biden's plan will crush America, if you think about it. You can't lock down. Again, we're growing at levels that nobody has ever seen before. Our plan is unleashing a rapid recovery. Our opponent's plan would hurt America very badly. It would send us into a depression.\nAnd with all of that being said, we are going to be having a very exciting Saturday at 5 o'clock in the Rose Garden, where I'll be putting forth my nominee for Supreme Court Justice. And I think it will be a great nominee, a brilliant nominee. As you know, it's a woman. We brought it down to five women. It's time for a woman to be chosen, with everything that's happened and with Justice Ginsburg's passing.\nWe are going to go sometime tomorrow morning, as I understand it, to pay our respects. And we'll be over there, and I guess they probably put that announcement out. But that will be done tomorrow morning. The Vice President was there today.\nAnd so, if you have any questions, we'll take a few questions.\nWell, we're going to have to see what happens. You know that. I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. And—and——\nOh, I know. I know. Yes, no, we want——\nWe want to have—get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very transfer—we'll have a very peaceful—there won't be a transfer, frankly; there'll be a continuation.\nThe ballots are out of control. You know it. And you know who knows it better than——\n——anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.\nGo ahead.\nPlease, go ahead. Please, go ahead.\nYou asked a question.\nGo ahead, please.\nSay it.\nCan you—I cannot hear you through your mask.\nShe is on my list. I don't have a meeting planned, but she is on my list.\nBut I don't really talk about the meetings planned. I— speak to people. I talk to people. But I don't have a meeting planned. No.\nI didn't know that. No.\nYes, John [John Roberts, Fox News], please.\nYes.\nI have.\nWell, I thought it was really brilliant. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is doing a fantastic job, I think he's a star. And he made a statement that I'll just read: \"Justice is not often easy. It does not fit the mold of public opinion and it does not conform to shifting standards. It answers only to the facts and to the law. If we simply act on emotion or outrage, there is no justice. Mob justice is not justice. Justice sought by violence is not justice—it just becomes revenge.\"\nI mean, I heard that, I said, \"Write that down for me, please.\" Because I think it's—it was a terrific statement. He's handling it very well. You know who he is, right? You—I think you know. I think everyone now knows who he is.\nI will be speaking to the Governor. And we have a call scheduled to make very shortly with the Governor. I understand he's called up the National Guard, which is a good thing. I think it's a very positive thing. And it will all work out.\nWell, we don't know that. I mean——\n——awfully good candidate.\nFrankly, I'd bet on you.\nI'd probably bet on you.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nNo, I didn't—not you. Right here.\nI'm not a fan of hers. [Laughter] And I would say this—and she has probably has heard that—but, I wish a lot of luck to Harry, because he's going to need it. [Laughter]\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nWell, I'll tell you what, we're looking at that, and that has to be approved by the White House. We may or may not approve it. That sounds like a political move, because when you have Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Moderna, these great companies coming up with these—the vaccines, and they've done testing and everything else, I'm saying, \"Why would they have to be, you know, adding great length to the process?\"\nWe want to have people not get sick. The vaccine is very important. It's the final step. I believe it's going to be the final step. And no, we're looking at that, but I think it's—that was a political move more than anything else.\nWell, I have tremendous trust in these massive companies that are so brilliantly organized, in terms of what they've been doing with the tests. I mean, I don't know that a government, as big as we are, could do tests like this. We've made it possible for them to do the tests in rapid fashion.\nBut when they come back, and they say that we have something that works and absolutely works, and they're coming back with great numbers and statistics and tests and everything else that they have to come back with, I don't see any reason why it should be delayed further. Because if they delay it a week or 2 weeks or 3 weeks, you know, that's a lot of lives you're talking about.\nScott, would you agree with that or how do you feel about that? Please, Scott.\nIt sounded to me—it sounded extremely political. Why would they do this when we come back with these great results? And I think you will have those great results, because why would we——\nWhy would we be delaying it? But we're going to look at it. We're going to take a look at it. And ultimately, the White House has to approve it. And maybe we will, and maybe we won't. But we'll be taking——\nLook, I have to leave for an emergency phone call. I'm going to let Scott and Larry finish up. Larry is going to talk about the economy.\nSo I'll be—I'll be back. I will see you tomorrow. A big day.\nExcuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.\nSay it?\nI have a—a big call. A very big call.\nSo I'll let you take over.Q.People are protesting in the streets. What is your message to them? People feel like we are on this carousel where another Black life is being taken.\n[At this point, the President left the press briefing. Pandemic Adviser Atlas and National Economic Council Director Lawrence A. Kudlow resumed the briefing and responded to questions from reporters.]", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1264"}
{"Title": "Interview with Pete Hegseth of \"Fox and Friends\"", "Date": "2020-09-27", "Text": "So we have a list of about 45 people, and it was set up over a period of time, a long period of time, in conjunction with a lot of other people that are very talented, conservative, but very talented people. And it was definitely a time for a woman. And so I had, I broke it down into five women, and this is a person who is just outstanding. A great student, a great scholar. Her professor, one of the most notable and actually the, probably one of the most respected at Notre Dame said that Amy was the best student that he ever had. He was there for many years. The best student. So that meant something because academics means something to me. And I'm just, I think it's going to be really thrilling. I hope it goes smoothly. Perhaps it will, perhaps it won't. I think it's going to be very hard to dispute her qualifications or anything about her.\nWell, I've been very happy that the two people that we put on. It's a very proud moment for a president to make choices. And if you look at Justice Gorsuch, or Justice, Kavanaugh, they've been just outstanding people, outstanding men. And it was time for a woman. I think I knew. I mean, there was thought of it last time, but I thought that at that time, Judge Kavanaugh, was Judge, was just very outstanding. And I just felt that this was the right time. I did consider her at that time, but when this happened with Justice Ginsburg, when this happened, this just seemed like a natural fit.\nNo, specifically I didn't do that because in theory you, it's nicer if you don't. I guess you have no, you could talk about anything you want, but I just really got to know her a little bit, a little bit the last time. And when this was happening, in the process of happening, I called her and I said, \"I'd like to have you come down.\" And it just worked out very quickly and very well. I didn't discuss certain concepts and certain things. And some people say you shouldn't, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't, but I decided not to do it. And I think it gives her freedom to do what she has to do. She has to make rulings. But I think she's going to make a lot of people, very proud. There's also, there has been, I noticed there's a tremendous clamoring for her. The public really, I've been seeing it. We're all human, and I've been seeing it. There was a tremendous feeling that she was somebody that was going to be picked. I didn't tell anybody, but a lot of people felt she was going to be picked.\nRight.\nSo I didn't think it was for me to discuss that with her, because it's something she's going to be ruling on. And this is what I was told, although I would have had the right to do that. But if you look at her past actions and rulings, I guess she maybe would be in the category that you mentioned. I don't know. I can say this, that she is certainly conservative in her views and her rulings. And we'll have to see how that all works out, but it will work out.\nIt's certainly possible, and maybe they do it in a different way. Maybe they'd give it back to the states. You just don't know what's going to happen. But I've been surprised. I've been surprised by some of the rulings that we've already had over the last year. You think you know somebody and then you get rulings that are a little bit different than you think could happen. So you never know what's going to happen. Mostly, I'm looking for somebody that can interpret the Constitution as written. We say it all the time. And she is very strong on that. And it will be very interesting.\nAlso our Second Amendment. I feel I know what she's doing on Second Amendment, but I can't really speak for her. And again, I'm picking a person. She's going to have to rule the way she feels. But the Second Amendment is under siege if Joe Biden got in, in any way, if he would have, because I can't imagine if that's going to happen, but your Second Amendment is going to be gone. And it's going to be gone quickly, I think. So we can't let that happen. But they'll probably be ruling on Second Amendment and various other things. They say it's the most important thing a president can do. I don't know if that's true. I mean, I would say military. You might agree with me on military protection.\nBut they say the selection of a Supreme Court Justice is the most important thing. And the other thing, by the end of the term, we'll have almost 300 federal judges and court of appeals judges, which is a record. So we will have had a great impact on the court system going forward.\nYeah. It's such a great question. It's just, you can't answer it. But I do believe that in a way, Justice Kavanaugh was a pioneer. What he went through was so horrible. False accusations, and he's such a gentleman the way he handled it, but nobody was, I don't think I've ever seen anybody for any position treated the way he was treated. And so viciously by Harris and all of them. The way they spoke to this man was so horrible. And I actually think it makes it easier for Amy. I think they can't do that again. They can never get away with it. Nobody's ever been treated so badly as Justice Kavanaugh, at that time, Judge Kavanaugh. I will say this, Judge Gorsuch, at the time Judge Gorsuch, he was treated pretty tough. Got through it strongly. He did a great job. But the way Judge Kavanaugh was treated was, I've never seen. I've never seen anything like it. I've seen some bad treatment. I have never seen anything like that. I think that makes it a lot easier for Amy.\nI don't know if they can hold back, but I think they don't look good if they go crazy again. They went crazy. They went, what they did was crazy. And we had a couple of people that weren't real fighters on our side. And they're gone. They're gone. I wonder where they went, but they're no longer with us, and that's a good thing. We have, I think we have great, the Republican Party is very united in this. Lindsey Graham, every one of our members, they're tremendous. Mitch. We speak all the time.\nWell, we worked very closely together and it's been pretty amazing. Look, we have, there's never been anything like it. If you think, again, by the end of, we have 40 or 50, we have many people in there waiting to be confirmed right now for federal judgeships. That's a big deal. A federal judgeship. And don't forget, President Obama left us over 100. It's unheard of. He left us over 100 because he probably thought that Crooked Hillary who was going to win. And in which case it wouldn't have mattered too much. I guess that's what he assumed. But he left us a lot. So we will have a record. And that's a, very record, that's a very important record. Again, judges and justices, especially justices of the Supreme Court. And to think that I'd have three in one term.\nWell, the only way they can do that if they win the presidency and they have to win the Senate. And I'll tell you, I think we're doing really well. There's a great hidden majority. I call it hidden, you can call it a silent majority, but it's not really silent. It's very, you see the rallies. Our people showed up last night in Virginia. We're looking at Virginia very strongly. We think Virginia is in play and you saw the people that showed up last night. We had probably 35,000 people show up at an airport on a short notice. So we think there's a lot of things going on out there that, much more so than even four years ago. Four years ago, you knew it better, you saw it early Pete, but four years ago we had tremendous enthusiasm. It's much more now. It's much more this year.\nI would like to. I would say we have plenty of time, just in case your next question would be, well, should you wait? They wouldn't wait, number one. And importantly, we have a lot of time. We also could go after. We have tremendous amount of time. And it's been done many times before this way. It's an election year. No, I think we're going to have it done easily before the election. I think it would be nice to do, get it out of the way. It's so important a decision. I think it's important. We're going to try to have it done quickly and before the election. But think of all the time. So then you have, from that day, you have all the way to January 20th. So I mean, who would not do this? They say, well, why don't you wait for the next? Well, elections have consequences. And we won the election. We have the Senate. We have the presidency. So I think, I think she'll be confirmed before, and probably long before the election, relatively long before the election.\nI think I prepare every day. I think when you're President, you sort of see everything that they're going to be asking and they may disagree with you, but we've done a great job. We created the greatest economy in history and there's never been, from an employment standpoint, from every standpoint, and now it's coming back. We closed it. We saved millions and millions of lives by doing what I did. And now we're bringing it back. It's a V. It's a V-shape, which is, it's maxed out. I mean, we're setting records on employment and everything else. Even the stock market. Look how high the stock market is. And we're rounding the turn. They hate when I say that, the opposition, but we are. We're rounding the turn on the pandemic. And very incredibly, we have some of the great vaccines, great companies, and we're going to have different vaccines, very powerful vaccines, great vaccines and therapeutics, but this is all happening very, very soon. So we're in great shape, but we built the greatest economy in history, and now we're doing it again. We're doing it rapidly. And I think next year, we're going to have a great third quarter, by the way. And next year I think is going to be one of the greatest years we've ever had on the economy. And it's going to, it's really very exciting, actually.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much, Pete.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-pete-hegseth-fox-and-friends"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference", "Date": "2020-09-27", "Text": "Does anybody know these two gentlemen in the room? If you don't, let us know. You shouldn't be here if you don't. It's great to have you guys.\nYesterday I was very proud to nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. She is one of our Nation's most brilliant legal minds, and I think she'll do very well. We're moving along very quickly. Tremendous unity in the Republican Party. It's the consequence of winning elections, which we did very substantially, both in the Senate and obviously in the White House. And I think we're going to take back the House; I believe that very strongly. Kevin is doing a fantastic job. And I really believe we're going to take back the House, and we're all working very hard on that.\nWe have noticed some comments made in the media about my incredibly qualified nominee, Amy. The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values. She's Catholic. That covers a lot of people. That's a very disgraceful thing to say.\nSome of the comedians—I don't think they're comedians, because comedians are supposed to be funny; they're not funny, like, at all. [Laughter] They're nasty, they're mean, and they think they're funny. And someday—hopefully, it's in 5 years—but someday, when I'm not here, they're going to be off television because their ratings, which aren't very good anyway, but their ratings are going to go down like you've never seen before. That includes a lot of others also.\nIn fact, I'm sort of waiting for the New York Times and the Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSDNC—I'm waiting for them to endorse me, because if they don't, they're going to drop with a thud like—you know, it was supposed to have happened long ago, and then we won a race, and it was a great victory.\nAnd our—I think we've never had a more energized base. I don't think so. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. The rallies that we're having are incredible; we call them \"protests.\" They're friendly protests. We don't want to call them \"rallies,\" but the friendly protest rallies are—have been incredible. People—I don't think anybody has ever seen anything like it. And this is still long before an election. This isn't like the evening before. These are long before an election.\nThe incredible crowd we had in Pennsylvania and Virginia—in every State, no matter where—in North Carolina, Florida—no matter where we go, we're having crowds like nobody—I don't think anybody has ever gotten before ever. Not even close.\nThere's a level of enthusiasm—in Iowa today, with the tractors—thousands of tractors. In different States, the boats. You know, thousands and thousands of boats. Boaters for Trump, Tractors for Trump, Farmers for Trump—it's really been very nice to see the level of enthusiasm.\nI thought, though—on the religious situation with We have noticed some comments made in the media about my incredibly qualified nominee, Amy. The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values. She's Catholic. That covers a lot of people. That's a very disgraceful thing to say.\nAmy, I thought we settled this 60 years ago with the election of John F. Kennedy. But seriously, they're going after her Catholicism. I will stand with her, fight with her, and we will make sure that these attacks stop, because they really—it's unprecedented. They're basically fighting a major religion in our country. This is incredible. Fighting any religion, fighting Catholicism is just incredible that they can be doing it. Are you Catholic, Rudy?\nPersonal Attorney to the President Rudolph W. Giuliani.Yes.\nTwenty-nine Supreme Court vacancies have occurred during an election year or before an Inauguration. In every single instance, going back to George Washington, the President has performed his constitutional duty and nominated a Justice. And in almost every one of these cases over the past 230 years where the President and the Senate were the same party, the Justice—as you know, that Justice was confirmed.\nThis is about two centuries—more than two centuries of precedent. And I think it will continue. I think we're going to have—I think it's going to go quickly, actually. And I think—and again, I don't know if I've ever seen the Republican Party more unified. I think it was probably even more unified with the impeachment hoax, actually.\nWhen they did the impeachment hoax, I think that was—which really turned out to be a hoax, because now you look at what's happening with the FBI and Justice Department; if you look at all of those text messages, e-mails that were sent, it—we have been totally proven right. They spied on our campaign, and everybody knew it. Biden knew it; Obama knew it. Everybody knew it. And the lamestream media just, you know, doesn't want to pick it up, although some have. I will say, Catherine Herridge at CBS has done a fantastic job on it. We appreciate that.\nBut this is a major scandal. This is a scandal, the likes of which nobody has ever seen. This is actually the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. And with the exception of a few, I mean, they just don't want to write about it. You should read about that, Kelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News], you know. You should write about it. You should write about it. You should do something on CNN about it, because it's the biggest single scandal of our time; certainly the biggest political scandal, perhaps, in history.\nThey spied on our campaign, and then they tried for a coup. That didn't work out too well. And it turned out that, you read the texts that came out over the last 3 days, it turned out that they were really—it was reversed; it was the DNC and the Democrats that were using Russia. And related or unrelated, Hunter Biden got $3½ million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Why did he get $3½ million? And then, he got millions more than we thought from Ukraine, and he got millions more than we heard about from China. Hunter Biden—\"Where's Hunter?\"\nSo these are all questions that are very, very big on the internet. The biggest thing going on the Internet is exactly this. And we're going to have to see how that all turns out, but it turned out that we were right. So we went through 2½ years of ruining people's lives, like General Flynn and many others—ruining their lives. And it turned out to be just the opposite. It was the Democrats that were dealing with Russia and other things.\nSo hopefully, our Attorney General and others working on this very, very hard, very diligently, will—it'll lead to something that will be very important for our Nation. I think it's very important for our Nation. It's one of the most important things.\nA central issue of the 2018 midterm elections was the Kavanaugh confirmation. And American voters punished the Democrats in the Senate. You so what happened; we picked up two seats. Again, something that hasn't been reported on very much. But we picked up two seats for their treatment of Justice Kavanaugh and expanded our Senate majority to confirm Supreme Court Justices, which was great.\nAnd now Democrats are really brazenly attacking Judge Barrett for, again, her faith, mostly, is what I'm hearing—for her Catholic faith. And whether it's Dianne Feinstein or anybody else, I think they ought to treat religion with much more respect. I think it's a disgrace that they can do it. Biden and the Democrats are desperate to distract from the real issues, which is that their party has been taken over by Socialists, extremists, and probably Communists. I think it's beyond socialism; I think it's a step beyond, and could be many steps beyond, if you take a look.\nAnd that if they win, they will nominate Justices who will destroy the American way of life, the American Dream. They will destroy the American Dream. They'll destroy America. They'll destroy the United States of America. Your private right to own a firearm will be totally eliminated, your guns will be confiscated, your ability to live by your religious faith will be devastated. They'll abolish America's borders and give Government health care to illegal aliens, which will destroy our health care system because so many people will pour into our country. That's a tremendous incentive.\nOn voter fraud, as you know, hopefully, there won't be a very big movement, because, hopefully, we're going to be able to win. I think we have the massive movement. I think we're going to have a tremendous, tremendous victory. There won't be a transition, because I can't imagine we call a transition if we win. You know, they talk about, \"Will there be a friendly transition?\" Of course, there will, but we have a big problem, and you see it every day; you see it happening every day with ballots.\nWe are gravely concerned about the Democrat assault on election integrity. In Brooklyn, 25 percent of mail-in ballots were ruled invalid in June's Democrat primary. You saw that. In a special election in New Jersey, 20 percent of the ballots were thrown out, and four people are now being prosecuted for fraud. This is all in the mail-ballots.\nThirty-five thousand mail-in ballots were rejected in Florida's primary, and one hundred thousand were rejected in California, and that's just the beginning. A week after Pennsylvania's primary, half of the counties were still counting ballots, and you'll be counting them here because this is a much bigger version of all of that. Just last week, a number of discarded military ballots were discovered in Pennsylvania. All of the recovered ballots—these were ballots that were thrown out—had been cast for a person named Donald J. Trump.\nIn Wisconsin, three trays of mail containing absentee ballots were found in a ditch; they were thrown in a ditch. Three trays. That's a lot. In North Carolina, voters are reporting receiving two ballots in the mail. Many—many voters. I hear it's thousands, but they're getting two ballots. I wonder if those are Democrat areas, because the word is they are.\nIn Iowa caucus's last winter, you know what happened there. You all reported on it, I think, very well. Right? Do you remember that, Mark [Mark Meredith, Fox News]?\nIt was not good, right? But in Iowa, they still don't really know who the winner was. I think they called somebody eventually, but it was many, many weeks later. But they really have no idea, and that's being—continues to be—and that's little; that's just a small—it continues to be litigated in Iowa. They can't run a simple caucus, yet now they're trying to radically write election laws nationwide, just weeks before the presidential election.\nI heard in New York today that Governor Cuomo wants to try and simplify the ballots because he thinks they're too complicated. And all of that, I agree with him. I think that's good. But you don't do that now. The ballots are starting to come in. And you know, you can't do it now. It's too late.\nJoe Biden and the Democrat extremists oppose all of these efforts to ensure election integrity. They oppose voter ID. Think of it: Voter ID. They want a picture. They have a picture for almost everything nowadays, but they don't want a picture. You had a picture to get into the Democrat National Convention. You had a card with your picture on it. Did you know that, fellas? You have a—to get into the Democratic National Convention, you have a card, and your picture is on it, but they don't want it for voting, which is our very sacred right.\nThey want—we want proof of citizenship, a Social Security number requirement. They don't want any of this to happen. And they want no signature verification. They don't want to have a verified signature.\nSo they want none of the safety valves that you would have. Think of it: They oppose voter ID. They approve proof of—they oppose proof of citizenship. They oppose a Social Security number and requirements for Social Security numbers as a safety valve. And they oppose even simple signature verifications. They don't want to have signature verification.\nThey want to require all States to do mail-in balloting, right? I call it \"unsolicited.\" Some people call it \"universal.\" I think \"universal\" doesn't make sense, because nobody understands why universal. So it's \"unsolicited.\" They want unsolicited mail-in ballots. In other words, you send these ballots to whoever you can think of.\nWe had a case, I guess in New Jersey, you were reading to me, where somebody was sent two ballots, and they had slightly—one was—had a hyphen in it, the name, and the other one had a \"K.\" And they got two names. And it's a—I wonder if that person was a Democrat. Probably was.\nAnd mailing of millions of ballots to people who never asked for them. So millions of people are going to be getting ballots who never asked for the ballots. They don't want the ballots, or maybe they want them; maybe they don't. Nobody knows, really. This is really a recipe for chaos. And when you look at what happened in Iowa—and again, that was run by very smart people. It was a very limited election. It was very small numbers we're talking about. We're talking about doing that for the entire Nation. And you can forget about November 3, because you're going to be counting these things forever. And it's very dangerous for our country.\nSo, certainly, transition—we all believe in transition. We believe not only in transition, but a very friendly. But when the ballots and when the system is rigged, which it is; obviously, it is. And the only one that knows that better than me are the Democrats. And they go into closed rooms, and they must laugh like hell at what's going on, because these ballots are being found. And this is the beginning. I talk about it now at the rallies. All these people are watching. Eyes and ears. Thousands and thousands. Tens of thousands.\nBut there's no justification for these extreme changes to the election law. And if you can go to the grocery store, you can have an ID with your picture on it to vote. It's so important. I mean, it's just so important.\nSo a lot of things are going on. Very importantly, though—I think very, very importantly is, when you do your reporting, I think you ought to report on the FBI scandal because it's one of the great scandals in the history of our country. And I think people want to hear about it. If you look at the internet, you'll see how people want to hear about it. And they will know about it, and it just makes the media look so bad. And there's so much reporting—I could go into it right now, but I'm not going to do that.\nBut it would be a tremendous thing for the mainstream medium—media to really start reporting. I think your ratings we go through the roof, I really do, because people really are tired of this fake stuff where you don't even talk about it. And the biggest scandal—certainly the biggest political scandal in the history of our country, by far; bigger than Watergate, much bigger than Watergate—and they try and avoid it as much as possible. It's getting very hard to avoid. So we'll take a couple of questions, and you may have a question for these two very wonderful people, brilliant people, from the standpoint of politics, I would say, and law. And if you have anything for Kayleigh, we'd love to do that.\nGo ahead, please. Phil [Philip Wegmann, RealClearPolitics].\nYes.\nI do. I'm sure she is. I think everybody is. I think everyone in the country. I think we've made it a very big issue, and it's an issue that the Democrats tried to get away with. I don't think they're getting away. I mean, so many reports now of phony ballots—you know, that I don't know if it would have been reported before.\nBut all of these rallies—you know, we had thousands of people last night, as you know. And we were in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The night before, we were in Virginia. I mean, those crowds are—whether it was 35,000 or 30,000, those crowds are massive. And that's on very short notice. All of those people are watching. You know, we have eyes and ears now that we wouldn't have had if we didn't bring it up.\nSo no, I'm sure she's watching, and I'm sure that everybody is looking at it. I think it's just common sense.\nGo ahead.\nNo, I didn't. I didn't.\nI just didn't think it would be appropriate. And I've watched over the years as Presidents would interview and talk and make a decision on a Supreme Court Justice, and I was actually surprised they wouldn't talk about various things, likeRoe; they wouldn't talk about, you know, things that are very important. They think it's inappropriate to talk about them. I don't know that it's inappropriate, but I've gone by that custom.\nGo ahead, Phil.\nNo, I don't know. I mean, you know, it would depend. I think she's going to rule on the law. I think she's going to be a great Justice for many years to come.\nBut I can say they also bring up health care. I mean, Obamacare is terrible. It doesn't work. We've made the best of it. We got rid of the individual mandate, which is great. We protect people with—we are going to protect people with preexisting conditions, 100 percent. But if we can end Obamacare and come up with a much better health care system that's much cheaper—much cheaper—and much better, which is what we'll do. On the other hand, if the Court rules against, we will manage the system better. But don't forget, we've already essentially gotten rid of Obamacare, because we got rid of the individual mandate, and it was all based on that. So we've done a tremendous amount because the individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. You had to pay a lot of money for the privilege of not paying for bad health care. So that was a terrible thing for people.\nAnd what we will do is, if we are fortunate enough to get rid of the little remaining in Obamacare—and again, individual mandate, the way I view it, that's no longer Obamacare, because that was the central point, and we won that; we've already won that, as you know. But by getting rid of that, it's different. It's a much different thing.\nThe other thing we've done is managed—here's the story: It's no good. It's too expensive. It's bad coverage. You don't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. All the things that President Obama said, you don't get. And Biden too, by the way, if Biden even—I don't think he has any understanding of it.\nBut you don't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. Twenty-eight times, President Obama said: \"You get your doctor. You get your plan.\" It turned out to be a lie.\nSo here's what we're doing: If we can terminate, we are going to have a much better plan, and you will have your doctor, you will have your plan. You'll have a lot of things that you don't get with Obamacare.\nNo, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm willing to take a drug test. I think he should too, because he's had a very uneven—I watched him with some of the—when he was with—you know, debating Pocahontas and Harris, who treated him so badly. But I watched him, and he was out of it. Right?\nAnd then, I watched him against Bernie Sanders, and he was okay. I mean, he wasn't great, but he wasn't terrible. He was okay. A far cry from the way he—you know what I'm saying. I mean, if you look at some of those debates, I said, \"There's no way he can continue. He can't continue.\"\nThen, all of the sudden, he debated Crazy Bernie Sanders. And you know what? The truth is, he was okay. And I said, \"How did he go from there, with those horrible performances, to where he was okay?\" And I always joke, but you know, it is true: He was no Winston Churchill in debating, but he was fine. And people say he was on performance-enhancing drugs. A lot of people have said that. A lot of people have written that.\nSo—so, take a look at it. Take a look. Why don't you just check it? You can check out the internet. You'll see. Plenty of people say it.\nAnd whether he is or not, it doesn't matter, but I would love to take a test, and he can take a test too.\nGo ahead, please.\nMark, go ahead, please.\nPresidential Debate in Cleveland, Ohio/Democratic Presidential Nominee Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\nYes, we are. We're doing it. These two gentlemen have been helping. And Kayleigh is there. And we have——\nI would say maybe a combination of these two. And either one of them is about five times smarter than Sleepy Joe.\nBut we had a little debate prep before we came here. I think this whole thing, though, is debate prep. You know, what I do is debate prep every day. I'm taking questions from you people all the time. I mean, I've taken a lot of questions from you over the last number of years, and he doesn't.\nI watched the way he was treated on MSDNC—on Friday, I guess, he did it live—and it was disgraceful. It was an embarrassment. I know her, and she's a pretty tough reporter. The way she was helping him along with those—it was so obvious what was going on. She was helping him. She was giving him a question and then helping him to answer the question.\nI know her very well. She doesn't do that. It was embarrassing, and people don't talk about it. I mean, play some of those clips. Play some of those answers, those—the answers that—where he wasn't able to give an answer, and she's pushing him; she's pushing him.\nThey never do that with me, I can tell you. But I don't have the kind of problems he has. So——\nWell, I don't know. I mean, a little time. I mean, not a lot.\nI'm running a country. I'm—I don't know—you know, I don't have the luxury. I watched other people over the years. I watched one, sort of, fairly recently—not too long ago—go into a cabin, lock himself into a cabin, and he came out, and he wasn't very effective. You know, he had so much—so many things going on. Sometimes, you can go too much in that stuff, you know. Sometimes, you can go too much.\nI mean, look, I've had—I'd never debated before, but then I debated a lot 4 years ago. And if you look at the polls—those polls that come out—hundreds of thousands of people in TIME magazine and all of the different polls; I think there's about seven or eight of them—according to those polls, I won every debate—every single debate, in the primaries and then when I debated Crooked Hillary. I won every debate.\nI mean, this isn't me saying—I felt I did—but this isn't me saying it; this is the polls. You had a TIME magazine poll. You had this, that. And I guess they take them off the internet or they get phone calls or something. But according to that, I won every debate, and I felt I did. But I understand the subject. Now, Chris is tough. I hope that Chris is going to be equally tough on Joe Biden. But I watched the young lady, who I won't—I won't say her name, but it was embarrassing the way she was getting him along.\nSo I just asked the question about drugs. I think it's something that would be appropriate, because you can't have a President that needs that kind of help.\nIf you do—if you do have a President that needs that kind of help, when you've got to deal with Putin, and you've got to deal with President Xi of China, and you have to deal with Kim Jong Un—and by the way, do you notice there's no war with North Korea? Which everyone thought we'd be in in about one week after I came to be President. They thought it was going to happen immediately. No war. And that's saving, perhaps, millions of lives, not just—you know, they were saying, \"Oh, 50,000 people.\" No, millions and millions of people could have died.\nNo. No. It's fake news. It's totally fake news. Made up. Fake. We went through the same stories. You could have asked me the same questions 4 years ago. I had to litigate this and talk about it. Totally fake news. No.\nActually, I paid tax, but—and you'll see that as soon as my tax returns—it's under audit. They've been under audit for a long time. The IRS does not treat me well. They treat me like the Tea Party—like they treated the Tea Party. And they don't treat me well. They treat me very badly.\nYou have people that—in the IRS—they're very—they treat me very, very badly. But they're under audit. And when they're not, I would be proud to show you. But that's just fake news. The New York Times tried it—the same thing. They want to create a little bit of a story, a little bit of—they're doing anything they can.\nNot only—that's the least of it. I mean, the stories that I read are so fake. They're so phony.\nNo, I didn't know anything about it.\nI don't know anything about it. I think somebody said they were going to do a negative——\nThey always do—they only do negative stories. I don't think, in the last—I used to get good stories in the New York Times. When I ran for office—and I happened to be conservative Republican—I don't think we've had a good story. They predicted my loss 4 years ago. They then apologized for their bad reporting. Then they predicted the FBI and all of these things. That's now proven to be a hoax—a complete hoax.\nThey got Pulitzer Prizes, along with the Washington Post. They should give all those Pulitzer Prizes back because everything was wrong. I mean, it was so bad. Their reporting was so bad. They were wrong. It was exactly the opposite.\nNow, there are people that should get Pulitzer Prizes: Solomon, Carter. I mean, they're not in the business of Pulitzer prizes, but Sean Hannity got it right. Lou Dobbs got it right. Laura got it right. Many people got—Tucker got it right. There were many people that got it right. I don't know what they get, other than a great salary and great ratings. I mean, I don't know what they get.\nPlease, go ahead.\nJordan [Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg News], go ahead.\nWell, basically, they're saying I paid nothing.\nYes, basically—well, first of all, I've paid a lot, and I paid a lot of state income taxes too. The New York State charges a lot, and I paid a lot of money in State.\nIt will all be revealed. It's going to come out. But——\nAfter the audit is—after the—I'm being—they're doing their assessment. We've been negotiating for a long time. Things get settled, like in the IRS. But right now, when you're under audit, you don't do it. You don't do that.\nSo we're under audit. But the story is a total fake. And all of their stories—this one—you know, we had the same exact questions, usually asked by the same people, and that took place 4 years ago, you remember. This was so well litigated. It's incredible.\nIf you look at the filings I have—I think I have 108 pages of filings for all these different companies that do very well, obviously, because the filings—and nobody talks about that. You'll learn much more if you look at those filings. And we have to file every single year.\nBut you'll learn much more if you look at those filings. Those filings are very complete. They're very big. They're very powerful. They're very accurate. And those are the filings that you'll learn much more and when it's done. But when you're under audit, you just don't release them. And, again, they treat me——\nI didn't call on you. I'm talking to him. You should be more respectful of this gentleman. You're very rude to him.\nBut I will tell you that I look forward to releasing that. I look forward to releasing many things. I'm going to release many things, and people will be really shocked. But the New York Times has been doing—it's fake story after fake story. I've never seen anything like it.\nAnd people understand it, and people—that's why the—the media has such a low approval rating now because of what they've done. It's really a shame.\nYes, go in the back.\nGood. [Laughter]\nYes.\nWe're in the process of doing that. I think it's horrible what they're doing. I mean, they're playing the religious card. And it's frankly—you're talking about Catholics. That's a very major religion in our country.\nI don't know—Chris, do you have anything to say about it?\nFormer Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie.I think it's obvious what they're doing. So, you know, she'll be strong, she'll be tough, and she'll stand up for what she believes in.\nAnd she went through—just like I did, 4 years ago, in terms of litigation of different things—she went through it before and did very well.\nRudy, what do you think?\nOh, I think they're going to—they'll come out very strongly. This is day one. I mean, we've just started this.\nThis is absolutely day one. And you know, I mean, they're going to be coming out very strong.\nThe Catholic Church is very well united on this. They are so thrilled that Amy was chosen. They are so thrilled. Oh, they'll be—you know, again, it's been 24 hours, okay? So it's been a very short period of time, but they're going to come out very strong.\nYes, please go ahead. OAN.\nPresidential Debate in Cleveland, Ohio/Democratic Presidential Nominee Joseph R. Biden, Jr./News Media\nIncredible.\nAnd the press doesn't ask those questions. It's incredible.\nI don't know. I mean, we're going to find out, because a lot things are going to come up in the debate. That may be one. I mean, the son didn't have a job. He had some big difficulties. And then, all of the sudden, he's making millions of dollars as soon as his father becomes Vice President. No, I think that'll come up. I don't think Joe can answer it, frankly. I think there's only one reason he made all that money.\nAnd then, you have to say: \"What about Joe's involvement? And why did Joe not give the billion dollars over to Ukraine, as an example, until such time as they let go of a Prosecutor that was investigating the company that his son was involved with?\"\nI mean, there are some bad questions. I don't think they have answers. And if we had a media that was fair—even just reasonable—this would be the biggest story for years and years and years. Then, you'd really be entitled to real Pulitzer Prizes, not the fake committee that gives you these fake awards.\nSo, I mean, it's a really fair question. But it's hard to believe, when you see the kind of money that he has made from China, from Russia, where the wife of the mayor of Moscow gives him $3½ million and nobody even has any question about it.\nWhy did he get $3½ million? I'll tell you why: Because Joe Biden was in on it. Joe was in on it. There's no way that he wasn't. And uses Joe Biden's plane—Air Force Two. Uses Joe—and they go to China, and then he comes back, and he never mentioned it to his father that he just got a billion and a half dollars?\nAnd now it's turning out that it's much more money than that, Rudy.\nIt's turned out to be much more money from China. They have—a member of the Chinese Communist Party gave him a lot of money. And the press has no interest in these stories. It's just—it's very disheartening for the people of our country.\nWell, I have all the information. It just came out. I mean, I didn't know about Moscow: $3½ million from the mayor's wife. I didn't know about that. And he's a very influential, powerful man in Russia, as you know. And it wasn't me; I didn't have anything to do with Russia. That came out loud and clear.\nWhat also came out is they should have never gone into this fake Mueller investigation. And it also came out that the 31 phones that were wiped clean shouldn't have been wiped clean. And that's a criminal act.\nAnd Bloomberg likewise shouldn't be paying for prisoners to go—in Florida—go and vote, because he's basically paying—which is totally illegal—going and paying prisoners. I hope he hasn't done it yet. But he's down in writing as doing it. This is what he wants to do so that he can ingratiate himself to the Democrats after they made him look like a total fool in the debate.\nI mean, what they did to him is incredible. And that he goes out and spends money, it shows you the problems that he's got. Mini Mike.\nBut for him to go out and buy votes, because that's—I don't know, you're very good lawyer.\nAre you allowed to go tell people that: \"Go vote. I'm going to pay off your tab\"?\nYes, because that's what it is. I mean, it's a very serious—a very serious charge.\nYes, please go ahead.\nNo, I didn't—I was talking to you. Yes.\nGood. Thank you.\nIn where?\nSo we're looking at it very strongly. It just happened. And I know about it. I learned about it today and yesterday. And we're looking at it very strongly. We have a lot of good relationships in that area. We'll see if we can stop it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-1265"}
{"Title": "Presidential Debate at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio", "Date": "2020-09-29", "Text": "How are you doing?\nThank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she's going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she's the single greatest student he's ever had. He's been a professor for a long time at a great school.\nAnd we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn't even think about not doing it. The only difference is they'd try and do it faster. There's no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.\nThank you, Joe.\nThere aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We're not elected for three years. I'm not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President-\nDuring that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I'm not elected for three years. I'm elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don't know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180million people with their private health care, that they're very happy with.\nWell, you're certainly going to socialist. You're going to socialist medicine-\nThat's not what you've said and it's not what your party is saying.\nYour party doesn't say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.\nAnd they're going to dominate you, Joe. You know that.\nNot according to Harris.\nJoe, you've had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don't tell me about this.\nAnd if you were here, it wouldn't be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn't want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn't want me to ban Europe.\nYou would have been much later, Joe, much later.\nWe're talking about two million people.\nYou don't know what's on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It's not on the ballot.\nI don't think so.\nThere's nothing happening there.\nYou don't know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don't know here view.\nThat's right.\nBecause they want to give good healthcare.\nYes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate.\nExcuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.\nThat is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare.\nChris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.\nWell, I'll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.\nI got rid of it. And we will protect people.\nGo ahead.\nWell, first of all, I guess I'm debating you, not him, but that's okay. I'm not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There's nothing symbolic. I'm cutting drug prices. I'm going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn't do it. Nobody's done it. So we're cutting healthcare.\nAll of the things that we've done.\nI'll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I'm getting it for so cheap it's like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing. Prescription drug prices, we're going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.\nThis is big stuff.\nThat's not what your party says, by the way.\nJoe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who's far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine.\nAre you saying you didn't agree?\nNot by much.\nNot by much.\nIf Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.\nOn Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.\nWith what?\nWith what?\nBut you agree. Joe, you're the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class.\nYou'd be surprised. You'd be surprised. Go ahead, Joe.\nListen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.\nHe just lost the left.\nYou just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk], they call it socialized medicine.\nWho is, Bernie?\nNo, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.\nI've already fixed it.\nWe've already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don't, Obamacare is no good.\nObamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed ... They shouldn't even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they'll probably blame him, but they'll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, \"You've got to run it so well.\" And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it's a disaster. It's too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn't work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that's cheaper and better.\nGo ahead.\nGood.\nOf course, we do.\nAre you going to pack the court?\nAre you going to pack the court?\nHe doesn't want to answer the question.\nWhy wouldn't you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left.\nListen, who is on your list, Joe? Who's on your list?\nHe's going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list.\nThe people understand, Joe.\n47 years, you've done nothing. They're understand.\nWrong.\nWrong.\nIt's so wrong.\nSo, if we would have listened to you.\nIf we would've listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It's China's fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China's fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don't know how many people died in China. You don't know how many people died in Russia. You don't know how many people died in India. They don't exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we've done, I closed it and you said, \"He's xenophobic. He's a racist and he's xenophobic,\" because you didn't think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute.\nYou didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn't have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, \"President Trump saved thousands of lives.\" Many of your Democrat Governors said, \"President Trump did a phenomenal job.\" We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, \"President Trump did a phenomenal job.\" We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn't have made ventilators. And now we're weeks away from a vaccine. We're doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We've done a great job.\nThe only thing I haven't done a good job, and that's because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It's just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that's the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don't care. I've gotten used to it. But I'll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood. You could've never done that, Joe.\nWell, you didn't do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.\nA far less lethal disease, by the way.\nWe would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You're months behind me, Joe.\nYou don't trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?\nWell, I've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.\nIt is a very political thing. I've spoken to Pfizer, I've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It's become very political because the left... Or I don't know if I call them left, I don't know what I call them.\nI disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn't say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago.\nBecause he said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that.\nWell, we're going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they're all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They're going to be delivering-\nIt's all set up.\nThat was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically.\nYou'll have the vaccine sooner than that.\n... they will have the vaccine very soon.\nDid you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me. Don't ever use that word.\nBecause you know what? There's nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you've done nothing.\nLet me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it's being built again and it's going up fast.\nOkay. It's going up fast. I look forward to talking about it.\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi.\nTell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk] Chuck.\nYou probably play more than I do, Joe.\nWait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn't know anything about the disease. Now we've found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren't, even younger people aren't. We've learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.\nBecause it's a political thing.\nThose states are not doing well that are shut down right now.\nHe wants to shut down the whole country.\nNo, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look... I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-\n... when needed. When needed, I wear masks.\nI don't wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen. I will say this-\nAnd they've also said the opposite. They've also said-\nDr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite.\nHe said very strongly, \"Masks are not good.\" Then he changed his mind. He said, \"Masks are good.\"\nI'm okay with masks. I'm not fighting masks.\nOutside.\nBecause nobody will show up.\nWell, it's true. Nobody shows up to his rallies.\nBecause people want to hear what I have to say. I mean-\n... I'm doing my job as a president, and I'll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-\nWell, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It's outside. That's a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.\nWe've had no negative effect.\nWe've had no negative effect, and we've had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.\nIf you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can't. Nobody cares.\nNo cares.\nYes.\nMuch faster.\nSo we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn't think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of... Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening and we're doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we've put back into the workforce. That's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. And he wants to close down the... He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country.\nA lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what's happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, \"Oh, we're going to open up on November 9th.\" Why November 9th? Because it's after the election. They think they're hurting us by keeping them closed. They're hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.\nWhen you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It's not fair. You're talking about almost it's like being in prison. And you look at what's going on with divorce, look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs. It's a very, very sad thing. And he'll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don't need somebody to come in and say, \"Let's shut it down.\"\nThat's wrong.\n[crosstalk].\nI have to respond to that.\nExcuse me, he made a statement.\nNo, people want their schools open. They don't want to be shut down. They don't want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It's so sad what's happening in New York. It's almost like a ghost town, and I'm not sure it can ever recover what they've done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives.\nThey'll be careful, but they want their schools open.\nI'm the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I'm very happy to do it-\n... and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When [crosstalk].\nI paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-\nI paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.\nYou'll see it as soon as it's finished, you'll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There's 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I'm totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.\nMillions of dollars.\nMillions of dollars, yes.\nMillions of dollars. And you'll get to see it. And you'll get to see it.\nChris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don't want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they're stupid, they go through the laws, and that's what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama Administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that's-\nThat's okay.\nBut why didn't you do it over the last 25 years?\nWhy didn't you do it over the last 25 years?\nHey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I've done more than you've done in 47 years, Joe. We've done things that you never even thought of doing.\nIncluding fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.\nHe has none.\nWhy didn't you do it before, when you were Vice-President with Obama?\nI got it done. And you know what happened?\nOur economy boomed like it's never boomed before.\nExcuse me.\nThey had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I'll tell you what, you'll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they'll leave for other places. [crosstalk] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.\nIt wasn't blooming.\nHe was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929.\nWhen COVID came along.\nExcuse me, Chris, wait.\nChris.\nThey said it would take... No, you're on number two.\nChris, Chris. They said it would take-\n... a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing.\n... standard fare.\nHe totally gave up on manufacturing.\nOhio had the best year it's ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they've ever had.\nMany car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn't come in with you. [crosstalk].\nChina ate your lunch- [crosstalk].\nChina ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and, wha--, he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we're at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow's wife gave your son three and a half million dollars?\nWhat did he do to deserve it? What did he do with Burisma-\n... to deserve $183,000?\nOh really, he didn't get three and a half million?\nWell wait, he didn't get three and a half million dollars, Joe?\n... dollars.\nOh, really?\nIt's a fact.\nDid Burisma pay him 183 thousand a month, with no experience in energy?\nI think he did.\nBy who?\nThe media.\n... because they're embarrassed.\nSo let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk].\nHe got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.\nOh, really?\nI'd like to know who they are.\nI'll fire them.\nSome people don't do a good job.\nThree and a half million, Joe.\nWhy did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?\nMy family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.\nEvery single one of them lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with government.\nAnd he got three and a half million dollars for nothing.\nChris, can I be honest? It's a very important question-\n... and the threatened Ukraine-\n... with a billion dollars-\nWell, and him too.\nWell, that's all right, but he does plenty.\nHe does plenty.\nOh yeah, sure.\nThat's true.\nYou did a crime bill, 1994, where you called them super-predators. African-Americans are super-predators and they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\nSo you did that, and they call you super-predator and I'm letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990--and that's why, if you look at the polls, I'm doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super-predators, and you've called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you've called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned, and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 200--250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every... Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, \"I support President Trump.\"\nI don't think you have any law enforcement. You can't even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren't you saying those words, Joe? Why don't you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won't do it, because they're run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don't. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they've got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order. And I'll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it.\nWhat is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town-\n... and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk].\nNo it's not, but you say it is.\nFine.\nI ended it because it's racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it, oh it's totally racial. [crosstalk]\nIf you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we would pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And, and really, they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It's a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I'm not going to allow that to happen.\nYou just don't know.\nYou don't know.\nDuring the Obama-Biden Administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at, uh, Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very...many places. Look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened a . . . Frankly, it was more violent than what I'm even seeing now.\n... is that the Democrats that run these cities-\n... don't want to talk, like you, about law and order.\nAnd you still haven't mentioned.\nAre you in favor of law and order?\nAre you in favor of law and order? [crosstalk]\nOkay.\nIt went down much more in ours.\nThe places we had trouble were Democratic-run cities. . .\nI think it's a party issue. You can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what's going on in Chicago where, uh, 53 people were shot and eight died. Shot. If you look at New York where it's going up, like nobody's ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100, 150, 200 percent, uh, crime, it is crazy what's going on . . .\n. . . and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't because he'll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it's over with. But if he ever got to run this country, and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have. . .\n. . . our suburbs would be gone. By the way, our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you've never seen before.\nOh, I know suburbs so much than you.\nThat's not what they are talking about, Chris. That's not what it . . . He's talking about defunding the police.\nHe doesn't have any law support. He has no law enforcement support.\nAlmost nothing.\nOh, really, who do you have? Name one group that supports you. Name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think. We have time.\nNo, no. Think about it. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.\nThere aren't any. I don't think there are any.\nHe's never done that.\nOh really? Oh really?\nI sent in the US Marshals. . .\n. . .to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him. For three days Portland didn't do anything.\nI sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.\nI don't know who said that.\nWho?\nI don't think she said that.\nI don't think so.\nYou mean I have to answer his stuff?\nHis statement?\nWait a second, you made a statement.\nI would love to end it. I would love to end it.\n. . . we could very quickly\nI'll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That'd be no problem. But I don't want to accept the National Guard.\nSure, I'm willing to do that.\nI would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing not from the right wing.\nI'm willing to do anything. I wanna see peace.\nYou want to call them? What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who would you like me to condemn.\nProud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what: somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left-wing. This is a left-wing problem. . .\nThis is a left-wing problem.\nOh you gotta be kidding.\nWell, then you know what, he's wrong.\n. . . hit you over the head. Antifa is bad.\nAntifa is bad.\nYou know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.\nAnd you ought to be careful of them, they'll overthrow you.\nBecause there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I've done in a period of three and a half years. And that's despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I hadda fight, both flanks and behind me and above, there has never been an administration that's done what I've done. The greatest, before COVID came in, the greatest economy in history, lowest employ--unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going.\nAnd by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling, and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we're building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him. Three hundred and eight thousand people died because they didn't have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we've rebuilt our military.\nThe job that we've done. . . and, and I'll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important. By the end of the first term, I'll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300, and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices. That is a record the likes of which very few people. . . and you know, one of the reasons I'll have so many judges? Because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.\nWhen you leave office, you don't leave any judges. That's like, you just don't do that. They left 128 openings, and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I'd say, if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president. You can't be a good Vice-President but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it'll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It's a record.\nYou son got three and a half million dollars.\nCan I answer. . .\nReally?\nAre you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.\nI don't know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. . .\n. . .for cocaine use. And he didn't have a job until you became Vice-President. Once you became Vice-President\n. . . he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.\nHe made a fortune. . .\n. . . and he didn't have a job.\nBut why was he given tens of millions of dollars?\nHe was given tens of millions of dollars?\nI know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.\nWhy did he get it?\nI want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon. If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven't destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren't put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what's going on, because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You've got to have forest management.\nI believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air, immaculate water, and do whatever else we can that's good. You know, we're planting a billion trees--the Billion Tree Project--and it's very exciting for a lot of people.\nI think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes. But I also think we have to do better management of our forests. Every year I get the call. California's burning, California's burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know, in Europe, they live their forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it's a forest city. He said, \"Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn't be that problem.\" I spoke with the Governor about it. I'm getting along very well with the governor. But I said, \"At some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.\"\nThat's burning down because of a lack of management.\nBecause it was driving energy prices through the sky.\nWell, not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive, and it's a much safer car, and you're talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500.\nNo, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, so, and by the way, we're going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.\nAnd I'm okay with electric cars too. I think I'm all for electric cars. I've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in California is just crazy.\nNot true. Not true.\nHe's talking about the Green New Deal. And it's not 2 billion or 20 billion, as you said. It's 100 trillion dollars.\nWhere they want to rip down buildings. . .\nAnd rebuild the building.\n... most ridiculous. . . Where airplanes are out of business. Where two car systems are out. . .\n. . . where they want to take out the cows too.\nYou know, that's not true either, right?\nThis is, this is a 100 trillion. . .\nThat's more money than our country could make in a hundred years if it were. . .\nIt would destroy our country.\nHundred trillion dollars.\n100 trillion dollars.\nI never said that at all.\nThey made it up.\nYou make up a lot.\nWait a minute, Chris. So why didn't he do it for 47 years? You were Vice-President?\nSo why didn't you get the world—China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We're supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. . .\n. . .not 20 billion. . . .\n. . . You want to rebuild every building.\nHe made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it.\nWhat he did is he said. . .\n. . .is he called the military stupid bastards.\nHe said it on tape. . . [crosstalk]\n. . .He said \"stupid bastards.\"\nI would never say that.\nYou're on tape.\nOh, you don't? Oh, well, that's a big statement.\nYou just lost the radical left. It's done. Oh you don't?\nSo when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we've caught 'em. We've caught 'em all. We've got it all on tape. We've caught 'em all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.\nHe knew about it too. So don't tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it's a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You're soliciting. You're asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited--they're sending millions of ballots all over the country. There's fraud. They found 'em in creeks. They found some, with the name Trump, just happened to have the name Trump, just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They're being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you've never seen. The other thing, it's nice. On November 3rd, you're watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done.\nBut you know what? We won't know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They're not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They're losing 30 and 40%. It's a fraud, and it's a shame. And can you imagine where they say, uh, \"You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.\" November 10th. That means, that's seven days after the election, in theory, should've been announced.\nWe have major states with that. . .\n... all run by Democrats-\nAll run by Democrats.\nIt's a rigged election.\nYeah. I think I'm counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I don't think—I hope we don't need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what's happening is incredible. I just heard, I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take 'em. We don't like 'em. We don't like 'em. They throw 'em out. . .\n... left and right.\nWhat you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that's okay. . .\nYou go and vote. You go and vote. . .\n. . . like they used to in the old. . .\nYou either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you're sending it in, they're sending it back and you're sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what's going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They're being sold. They're being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country.\nThis is not going to end well.\nThis is not going to end well.\nYou're wrong. You're wrong. I love counting the votes. . .\nThat could be fraud.\nExcuse me, Chris, when you have eighty million ballots. . .\n. . . sent in and swamping the system. . .\nYou know it can't be done. You know it can't, and already, there's been fraud deception and . . . .\n. . . Eighty million ballots.\nCould be months.\nI'm urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that's what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They're called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren't allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging, I am urging my people. I hope it's going to be a fair election. If it's a fair election. . .\n. . . I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that. And I'll tell you what. . .\n. .. from a common sense. . .\nI'll tell you what it means. . .\nIt means you have a fraudulent election. You're sending out 80 million ballots. . .\nThey're not equipped. These people aren't equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them.\nYou think that's good?\nIt's already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney's race. . .\nLook at Carolyn Maloney's race. They have no idea what happened. . .\nI want to see an honest ballot count. . .\nI want to see an honest ballot count.\nAnd I think he does too. . .", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-debate-case-western-reserve-university-cleveland-ohio"}
{"Title": "Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News", "Date": "2020-10-01", "Text": "If you look at what he did, he was probably, or possibly losing that coherence that everybody talks about, because he's a mess. Let's face it. He's a mess. Now I could have waited, but he was saying so many lies that I figured it was just better to bring it up as he's saying them, because it was just lie after lie, after lie.\nAnd so I'd do it as he said it, I would criticize him. And I think it was effective. If you look at the polls, I mean, almost all the polls, the poll people, the polls say that I won. The Hispanics, they had me close to 70% at 28 because they're strong people, smart people.\nI mean, I would have preferred letting him catch himself because he can't issue a full statement practically, but at the same time, on the assumption that he does, he's going on and on with lie after lie, so I had to correct those lies as they came up. Too many to go back and get. We didn't have enough paper. Too many to go and get. And I don't know. I think it was very effective. Frankly, I'd like to leave the same format. I like the format.\nWell, this is the rules that were agreed to, but I think it would be very bad. Do you remember with Hillary Clinton, they had modulated my mic, and they actually apologized for it, but they modulated my mic. So when I looked at her, they had my mic turned off or way down, and I said, \"What's going on over here?\" They actually issued an apology. So we're dealing with very tricky people here, but I think you remember that very well.\nThey modulated my mic and they say I won all of the debates. So I was in 16, 17 debates. They say I won all of the debates. I like this format, but at the same time, he's got got to be truthful. And by the way, a number of people brought up today, Sean, that he was the one that interrupted me. He started off with three major interruptions long before I started doing it to him.\nWell, I went after him on that and I said, \"Are you going to stack the Court?\" I also said, \"Are you going to say the words law and order?\" He wouldn't say them. He then said, \"Law and order with safety and justice,\" or something. But I said to him that, but we need law and order in our country. And the Democrats cities are falling to pieces with these people running them.\nBut stacking the courts. They can have many justices. They want to put many because we've been beating them, and we have the nine justices and we have a great new one going on. But now what they want to do is they want to put many additional justices on the Supreme Court. It's sort of like you're losing the game and you start cheating.\nThey are. I mean, they're doing it with the ballots, they're doing it with the Supreme Court, and it's a very sad thing. But they are, they are looking to stack the court. And they are also going to add two or three new states. I heard Guam and two others that you mentioned, as you know. That would give them six automatic Senate seats, automatic, no chance. It would be very unfair. And 20 something congressional seats. So that's what they want to do.\nSo if you give them what they want, we really have a one-party system. We can never catch up. So they'll be talking about anywhere from four to six senators. Republicans can't win those states, although I've been better to Puerto Rico than any other president. I've given them a lot of help. But if you take a look at what's happening, they're not good to Puerto Rico, but I've been good to Puerto Rico. I have a great relationship to Puerto Rico.\nBut they're looking for statehood. A lot of Puerto Ricans don't want statehood. They're doing better the way it has now, frankly. And you've been seeing this. This has been taking place. They want to put two or three states. So they want to have 53, right? 53. What's the flag going to look like? Right, Sean? What's the flag going to look like? They want to have 53 or 52? Depending on what they do, I guess they could probably do even more than that. We have islands all over the place. What don't they go for the whole ball game?\nSo it's a very, very sad thing for our country. Very, very sad thing. And in all fairness to Mitch, he did not want to do the nuclear option. And I disagreed because I said, \"They're going to do it.\" It turned out that they are, but he's a legitimate guy. He wasn't going to do the nuclear option because he thought it was bad for our country. So I understood that. I didn't go wild.\nBut I did say, \"It would be good to do it because they're going to do it.\" So it's a very sad thing. So you're going to have two or three more states added. You're going to have four or six senators added, 100% Democrat, 100%. You're going to have maybe 20 congressional candidates or districts added. And it's really a horrible thing. It's going to be very unfair. You're going to end up having a one-party system in the United States. So if people want to stop that you got to vote against the Democrats.\nSo she did test positive. I just heard about this. She tested positive. She's a hard worker, a lot of masks. So she wears masks a lot, but she tested positive, and I just went out with a test, because we spend a lot of time and the first lady just went out with a test also.\nSo whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don't know. It's very hard when you're with soldiers, when you're with airman, you're with the Marines and the police officers, I'm with them so much. And when they come over to you it's very hard to say, \"Stay back, stay back.\" It's a tough kind of a situation. It's a terrible thing.\nSo I just went for a test and we'll see what happens. I mean, who knows? But you know Hope very well. She's fantastic and she's done a great job. But it's very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement and they come over to you and they want to hug you and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close and things happen.\nI was surprised to hear with Hope, but she's a very warm person with them, and she knows there's a risk, but she's young. And I just went out for a test. They just do it. It'll come back later, I guess. And the first lady also, because we spend a lot of time with Hope and others. So we'll see what happens, but you have to treat our people great. You can't just say, \"Stay away, stay away.\"\nThey come up to you. They have such love with what we've done for them. And there's such love and you have to treat our people great. I think the vaccines are coming quickly. I do think it's somewhat political. They'd like to do it, even the drug companies, they've dealt with these people a long time.\nI think they'd like to do it after the election, even if it's a couple of days, but the fact is, the vaccines are coming out. The therapeutics are coming out, and they're coming out really good. Regeneron and others, other companies, are great, Eli Lilly.\nAnd so, we'll have to see. The survival rate is so much better now than it was. You've seen those numbers. I guess 95% or something like that, better. So we'll have to see. I mean, I'll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning, but I spend a lot of time with Hope and so does the first lady, and she's tremendous.\nI was a little surprised, but she's a very warm person. She has a hard time when soldiers and law enforcement comes up to her. She wants to treat them great, not say, \"Stay away. I can't get near you.\" It's a very, very tough disease.\nA scam and everyone knows it, Sean. It's a scam and everyone knows it.\nWell, in New York they last 100,000 ballots were sent out wrong. The envelopes were wrong, the names were wrong, everything was wrong. So they said, \"Oh, that's okay. We'll send out a new 100,000.\" Okay, let's assume they get it right. What happens to 100,000 that they sent out? They're going to be sent back by somebody and it's going to be a fraud.\nThis is a terrible thing that's happening to our country. And the only one that knows it better than you and I and other people is the Democrats. They know it, they know it. They're smart. But I'll tell you the big hope is that we have great federal judges. And we have a lot of cases in front of these federal judges. And I think they're really talented, very smart. And I think that we're going to do very well.\nHow about this? The election ends on November 3rd, but they're giving certain states the right to go another week. So that means we're not going to know, because they're big states, that means we're not going to know the election for another week. Just take a look at New York. Take a look at the one city, the ballots that were thrown into a garbage can and they all had the Trump name on it.\nThey were military ballots. They were thrown into a garbage can. The ones that were on a tray and they were thrown into a creek or river, it's a terrible thing. And if you look at Carolyn Maloney, what they did to that guy that ran against her is a disgrace. That's in New York, and that's only for a congressional race.\nThey have no idea where the votes are, where the ballots are. This is going to be all over. This is in Virginia. This is in New Jersey. It's a very, very sad thing. And hopefully we can win by a lot because I have no doubt that they're going to be doing a number. I have no doubt about it.\nAnd the press knows that too. They act so sacrosanct. They act so, \"Oh, it's so terrible. He's talking about our democracy.\" They know what's going on. It's really a shame. If the other side did this, you would see everybody would be arrested, put in jail. You have to see what's going on.\nBut the good news is we just got a very good decision in Rhode Island, great decision. We have some great decisions coming down. You have to have the votes in by November 3rd. You have to have it signed. You have to have it certified. They have to guarantee the certification.\nI mean, in Nevada, Sean, they don't want to have any certification of a signature, just do a signature and they don't want to have certification. I think you don't even have to sign it. And the governor is a very political person. It's a ridiculous thing. And we're going to win Nevada on a fair basis, but it's very hard when they send millions of ballots out and then they cheat.\nWell, it's a scam. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. The only sad thing is nothing's happening with them and their a bunch of crooks. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to do a coup and they got caught. Now we get to see what's going to happen. It's time to move.\nThis is ridiculous, okay? This is ridiculous. It's so sad. We caught them spying on our campaign. Never happened before. Spied before and after, and it never happened before. And I watched Comey. He couldn't remember anything, but he's writing all these books.\nThey're guilty as hell. They should all be in jail, okay? You know it and I know it. They should all be in jail and it's disgraceful. It's a disgrace to our country if they don't go to jail. Hillary Clinton got caught, Comey got caught, they all got caught. And Biden, by the way, mentioned the Logan Act. That was a big part of it, and Obama too. It's a disgrace what's happened, a disgrace. And they should do something about it. They can't let this just go on ad infinitum. They should do something about it.\nalready rebuilt the military, two and a half trillion dollars. It's the strongest military in the world by far. We have weapons the likes of which nobody even comes close to. And so we've done that. We've cut taxes at a record level. If you look at regulations, we've cut more regulations than any president in history by far.\nWell, I think better than that. I think you're going to see some great numbers just two days before, because you're going to have the third quarter come out just before the election, and I think you're going to be up anywhere from 22 to 35% in GDP. And if that's the case, that's bigger than any economic rebound in history. So I think that'll be good. Let's see what happens, but those numbers are coming out sometime prior to November 3rd, which is the election.\nThank you very much, Sean. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-fox-news-3"}
{"Title": "Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News", "Date": "2020-10-08", "Text": "Really good, and First Lady is doing really good. I thought Mark was fantastic, and I love your show.\nYeah, I just saw the doctors today. They think I'm in great shape. I'm in great shape. I know I'm in good shape [crosstalk].\nAnd I'll tell you, I took this Regeneron. It's phenomenal. Eli Lilly has something very comparable. It's phenomenal. It's a whole new day. It's all… If you go back a few months, nobody ever even thought about this stuff. We came up with it, and I'm going to have it delivered to every hospital we have sick people with the COVID, or the China Virus as we call it, and we're going to make people better. It actually made me better. I went in, I could have left a day later.\nI'm telling you Sean, it was incredible. So, that's Regeneron. But again, Eli Lilly has something similar. The kind of things we're coming up with now are incredible. Remdesivir, but that's a little bit different, works much differently actually. But these things are absolutely incredible. I think I'm going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we have enough time to put it together. But we want to do a rally probably in Florida on Saturday night. I might come back and do one in Pennsylvania the following night. It's incredible what's going on, because I feel so good.\nWell, what we're doing is probably the test will be tomorrow, the actual test, because there's no reason to test all the time. But they found very little the infection or virus, if any. I don't know that they found any. I didn't go into it greatly with the doctors. We have these great doctors at Walter Reed, and you do rely on them. They're really fantastic talents, and they came in from Johns Hopkins also and other places. Yeah. When you're president, there are so many doctors looking over me. I think I'm the most analyzed human being in the world right now. But we have… They had people at not only Walter Reed which is incredible with the job they do, but also Johns Hopkins and other hospitals. I think they're amazed at how quickly this went frankly.\nWell, I didn't even want to use them. Last time, I had a big problem. They isolated my mikes when I had one debate… We had three debates with Hillary. Or I think the first debate, they… Excuse me. On the first debate, they asked isolated the mike and they isolated it very, very seriously, and they actually apologized to me. And I said… \"What's this all about?\" They were Clinton people. And I said, \"We ought to just do the debates ourselves, John. We ought to just do it ourselves.\" I pick… I'm the president, so we won't to have debates. I'd rather just do it ourselves. Pick some good anchor. So I ended up with Chris Wallace who's essentially… Look, his father did me once or twice. Twice, I guess. Those 60 minutes, he was great, Mike. Chris is not Mike that I can tell you. He's not even close, but Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked Biden about, \"Why did he get all of that money from the Mayor of Russia, from the wife of the Mayor of Russia?\" Then Chris wouldn't let that be answered.\nWhen I said, \"What did you do with a billion dollars? You're not getting a billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor.\" Chris wouldn't let that. He protected him. The guy was choking like a dog. He couldn't answer the questions and he was choking like a dog. And Chris kept staying, and so now we have another one. I didn't know this, but the other one is from C-SPAN and he's never-Trumper, and I think somebody said he worked for Biden at one point. These are the people we get.\nThat's okay, because I've had some bad ones over the years, and I've got an unblemished record I think in the debating world according to the polls. If you look at [inaudible] 15 debates last time, and they say I won them all against very talented people in some cases. But I will say this, that it's a very sad thing. Now you have this Debate Commission. It's a joke. The commission's a joke. Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago when they apologized. They were oscillating my mike. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary who turns out to be very crooked.\nLook at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her. So we'll see what happens. But no, I'm not interested in doing a virtual. I'm not Joe Biden. I'm not going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. That gives them the answers, because there'll be handing him the answers just like he gets what he asks. He does news conferences, he does them and they give him the answer and they give him the question and they give him what kind of a news conference. He does them all the time. He was choking like a dog the other night, but Chris Wallace bailed him in. He just bailed him in or bailed him out.\nWell, I might. I'll do it right through your show. Let's go, Joe. Let's have a fair… Let's get a fair anchor, somebody like a great Sean Hannity. We'll get Rush.\nWe'll get Mark. We'll get Laura.\nWe'll get Judge Jeanine.\nWe got a lot of them out there. We got a lot. We'll get Jesse or Pete. We got a lot of them. Tucker [inaudible] feeling good. [crosstalk] is a disgrace.\n[inaudible] but this is a disgrace what's going on. So now I find out the guy that's doing it from C-SPAN is a never-Trumper, but I don't mind that. Look at the people I've had in the past, and I've always won the debates. I had Martha Raddatz. Her hatred was so incredible I couldn't believe it, but I beat Hillary in that debate easily. So I don't mind that. It's not even that. But I'm not going to sit behind a computer and have somebody feed him answers, because he has no idea, because he won't be president for three months before the wonderful Kamala takes over with her. She's the most liberal person in the senate. She's not a socialist. She's a step beyond socialism as you know.\nI thought Mike was great, legitimately. I don't mean because he's with me and he's my friend and he's done a great job as vice president, I thought he was great. He's a calm person. We're really a good combination. A lot of people have said that for a long time. He's a calm person. He's a good person, and he was just… He couldn't believe some of the things she was saying, and he really didn't. He couldn't believe it what she was saying. They lie. They lie so much, like fracking.\nHim and her for a year, whatever the Democrat debate said, we are against fracking. We will… Biden says, \"We will never ever see fracking and…\" etc. As soon as he gets the nomination, he has to center over a little bit. No, we want to go fracking. We'll be fracking. Her too, even her. I mean, she's a super… Then they get beat up by AOC plus 3, because they said, you never said that before. Now the press gives them a pass. The reason they give them a pass is because they are fake. The news is fake, the enemy of the people and the press gives them a pass. If I ever did that, I would be excoriated.\nYeah, terrible thing.\nI think it was a terrible thing to say. I think it's so disrespectful to the people, and he should have said something, and say, \"Look, to the best of my knowledge, this is probably what I'd do.\" I think what he said was so disrespectful to the process and to the people. What he said then was just disgraceful. But what that means really is that they're going to do it, because obviously, that means 100% that's what they're going to do. No, they're going to end the filibuster and they're going to do things that you wouldn't have thought. I'd been fighting the filibuster with Mitch for a long time, because I said, \"Mitch, they're going to do whatever. If they ever got in, Schumer would do that on day one.\" I agree that what they did was right.\nYou take a look at what Mitch and some very good Republican senators, because it's good for the country. But I said, \"Here's the problem. If they ever got in, day one, this would be the first move they make, end the filibuster,\" the nuclear option as they call it. And they'll do that… Not a week will go by, probably not a day will go by. But again, Harry Reid did it, that's why we have so many judges. I want to thank you very much, Harry Reid. Because Harry Reid, he ended the filibuster and I'm going to have 300 judges by the time I finish. 300, it's a record by the end of the first term. Think of that. It's a record [inaudible] the term. By the end of the first term, I have 300 judges just about give or take a few couple. And-\n… it's all because of… Think of it, Sean. It's all because of Harry Reid and a lot of good work-\n… by a lot of good Republicans including Mitch.\nWell, he's got a lot of non-answers. Look at Second Amendment, you never talk about Second Amendment. He wants to take away your guns 100%. He put Beto as a… He turned out to be… He was exposed by Ted Cruz and me, I think I helped a lot too. But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that, but I want to be nice, because it's a nice evening show. But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He's going to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever… Nobody asks him about the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is very important. It's a big thing that we campaign on it. I protected this.\nIf I weren't president, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does it. Nobody's talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he's not pro-life. What is he? Why don't you ask him that question? He doesn't want to talk about it. But he endorsed a Governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby late term abortion, but executed a baby because he said the baby can be born and then you can kill the baby. He's totally in favor of that. I can tell you, your pro-life groups are… They're in mess. This is their one shot because what's going on is so bad.\nIt's so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby is born, that's… When you talk about late term abortion, this is early term execution, and it's a very, very bad thing. But you don't ever hear everybody talking about pro-life, pro-choice with Biden. Did you ever hear it? I haven't heard it. Very rarely do you hear it? I don't think he'd know how to discuss it. But very importantly, a Second Amendment. They just don't discuss the Second Amendment. He's going to take your guns away. So everybody with a gun, you can't vote for him because you're not going to have your gun. At the same time, they want to defund the police.\nSo if you're not going to have police protection and by the way, you can't have a gun. So if one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are no cops around and you don't have a gun to protect yourself, that's a great combination. The suburbs are going to fall. A lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs. Women of the suburbs, they do or don't like Trump. I don't know. But what I've done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over as you know. The suburbs have become more unsafe than the cities run by the Democrats. And so I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I'm the one that's protecting them both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning.\nThey want to build low-income housing right next to your house as the American dream is destroyed, but they don't talk to Biden about this. They don't talk to him about law and order. I said to him the other night, \"Mention the words law and order.\" He wouldn't do it. He wouldn't do it. I said, \"Don't mention the word law and order. Go ahead.\" He wouldn't do it. And then of course Chris Wallace came in to protect him.\nAnd I condemn the people on the left like Antifa that are burning down your cities all summer long and without any control whatsoever. They're all Biden people, meaning not Biden. Biden's not smart enough to know what the hell it even is, but they're of that philosophy. I condemn them very strongly, very, very strongly. It's not just the right. It's the right, it's the left. But the left has been the problem up for a long time. Antifa is a big, big problem. I see Whitmer today, she's complaining, but it was our justice department that arrested the people that she was complaining about.\nIt was my justice department that arrested them. But instead, she goes and does her little political act and she keeps her state closed although we just won the big case as you know to open up Michigan, because what she's doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed, the schools are closed and all state is closed. People are being hurt very badly by it in the form of drinking and suicides and depression. It's a very sad thing. But now, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes. And very sadly, if you take a look, he wants to raise taxes, but he says he's going to end our tax cut. Well, people are getting actually much more.\nMike [inaudible], he said 2000 was actually much more than $2,000 in child tax credits, which is a $1000 a child. but he wants to take all that away. So therefore, if you do nothing else, you're raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our country. If he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic which hopefully we're rounding the turn and we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics and the vaccines are going to be coming very soon. But I'll tell you what I took is incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It's incredible, and we're going to get it to everybody free of charge.\nIt's going to hospitals. Starting very soon, the military is going to be delivering it. But he's looking to do big, big tax cuts, big, big tax increases at a level that's never been seen. Nobody's ever gotten the cuts that I got. I got the biggest tax cuts ever given as you know Sean, better than probably most. But he's going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And now, people are going to pay $2000 plus child tax credits, all that. It's going to be a disaster for our country. It's going to put our country into a depression. Your 401ks are going to go down the tubes, and your jobs are going to go away, and you're going to have a depression the likes of which our country has never seen before. And that possibly includes 1929.\nWell, it's a deal that was conceived up by not smart people, AOC plus 3 and others, but I don't even think they had any experience in the environment. But this was a deal conceived up. The real price is $100 trillion. That's more money that this country could make in 100 years if things went well. They literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows. Little windows, so you can't see out, you can see the light. The whole thing is so crazy. It's such a crazy thing. Take a look, Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because they have the manifesto.\nThey've agreed to most of these things, and it's going to cost more money. Our country will be a Ninth World country, not a Third World country, a Ninth World country. We won't have energies. Look at what's happening with the rolling blackouts in California? Looking at where California is going to have to ration water? You know why? Because they set millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren't doing very well without water to be honest with you. But it's a very sad thing that's happening. It's still common sense. Even the fires in California. I talk about, you need…\nI was with governor Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but I get along with him. Number one, you should let water come down from the North and accept it instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest management. We send them so much money. I don't have to, but I want to help California. But they have the biggest forest fires because they don't manage their land. They don't have separators. They have trees that have been laying on the ground that are stone cold dead, dry like a matchstick. You throw a cigarette butts on between the leaves and the trees, everything catches on fire. You lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time. They get to manage their forest. And if they manage their forest, you're not going to see the forest fires.\nWell, I want them to vote, but I will say this, absentee is okay, because absentee ballots… Excuse me. Absentee ballots are fine, because absentee ballots, you request, you ask for a ballot and you request and that's it. Absentee ballots are absolutely fine. You request them, you fill them in, you send them back in. But these unsolicited ballots, universal unsolicited ballots Sean, it's going to be a disaster the likes of which we've never seen. We will never have seen an election like what's going to take place. Thousands of ballots all over the country are being reported. Some thrown in garbage cans with my name on them. Some thrown in trays in a river. What's going on is absolutely crazy. We have people watching. We have US attorneys watching. We have sheriffs watching. We have US Marshals watching. But with all of that-\n… [crosstalk] big and tremendous fraud.\nWell, my supporters are going to be mostly people that vote. They go to the vote the old fashioned where it's like go to the voting booth and vote, which first of all, we should have voter ID all over the country. We don't. When you buy something, you have voter ID. To get into the Democrat National Convention, you had to have voter ID.\nRight. But to get into vote, you don't need voter ID in many places. In many places, you do. Indiana has a great system. You have many places where you do have it. But we should have voter ID, universal voter ID. When you go to vote, they should see who you are, make sure that it's not fraudulent. But this will be one of the greatest fraudulent, most fraudulent elections ever because of this whole thing with… They're sending out millions and millions and millions of ballots. Where are they sending them? Who's sending them? Where are they going? Where are they coming back from? How many are fraudulent? Are they being thrown away? Are they being sold?\nAre they being harvested? It's a terrible thing, Sean. Despite that, I think we're going to have a tremendous victory. I saw some polls just now, some real polls not the fake news polls where they put out fake numbers like at CNN and ABC, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, NBC. It's the same stuff as I had. It's not nearly as bad as it used to be. It used to be much worse believe it or not. It's hard to believe when you think of it. But I'm looking at polls that are doing great. We're doing great in Ohio. We're doing great in Iowa. We're doing great in many, many places, many places. Then you come home, you turn on television. You say, gee, I'm four down. I can't believe it. But they're the fake polls.\nWe caught them spying on our campaign. This is treason. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected administration/ president. We have all the evidence down. Now, we have to see what the law enforcement's going to do with it, but we caught them spying. As sure as you're sitting there, I assume you're sitting, but as-\n… sure as you're sitting there, we caught them spying on our campaign. You know that almost better than anybody. And it's something when you see the New York times, Washington Post get [inaudible] surprises they got everything wrong. They get everything wrong. We caught them spying in our campaign. We caught them trying to take down a duly elected… And then they talk about, we want a peaceful transition of power. Peaceful-\n… [crosstalk] answer was that answer last night. Peaceful transition. Look what they did. They spent three and a half years trying to terminate a presidency.\nIt's doing really well.\nThank you very much.\nThank you, Sean.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-fox-news-4"}

At the second debate, we have a never Trumper as a host, but that's okay because I'd beat him in the second debate also. And I'm not going to do a virtual debate.\nNo, I'm not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That's not what debating's all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate. It's ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want. I have a host who I always thought was a nice guy, but I see is a never Trumper. You know, it came out that he's a never Trumper. And we do have some of them Maria, believe it or not, because they don't like to win. And so, but I'm not doing, I'm not doing it a virtual debate.\nThey didn't even tell us about the debate Maria.\nYeah. We learned it the same way you learned it. They called up two minutes ago and it was announced and they're trying to protect Biden. Everybody is. Like that NBC disaster, where he went on the show with Lester Holt. It was like, it was meant for a child. It wasn't meant for a grown person. He gets up and he says, \"We're not fracking. We're not fracking.\" He was fracking for six months. He was fracking. He was raising his very thin hand and he was fracking. And now all of a sudden, he's not fracking. Well tell the Pennsylvania people that you're going, it's ridiculous. He said, he's not fracking. That's all he said. And then all of a sudden, he goes to a fracking mode. And how about her? She committed her life to it. And all of a sudden she's a fracker. She's a big fracker. They going to stop fracking the minute they get into office, they're lying to everybody. They're lying about so many different things, but you have to confront them people, you can't do it over a computer.\nYeah. Well, first of all, I think I'm better to a point where I'd love to do a rally tonight, I wanted to do one last night, but I think I'm better to a point that I feel better than I did you know, I jokingly said 20 years ago, I feel perfect. There's nothing wrong. I had a case, I got it knocked out. I think it was Regeneron that was responsible for it. Because of that, it was sort of like almost a gift from heaven because of what I went through and I felt pretty lousy. A lot of people did. A lot of people do. No matter how good the security, you're not going to protect yourself from this thing with just your standard anything, unless you just literally don't come out and even those people found out. Did you see in New York City, the most heavily locked down place, the people that caught it the most were the people that were caught in their houses and their apartments.

{"Title": "Interview with Rush Limbaugh on the EIB Network", "Date": "2020-10-09", "Text": "G'head.\nWell, I want to thank you, Rush. You're a fantastic man, a friend of mine, but before I really even knew you as a friend you were like a supporter and I said, \"I know that guy, he's got a big audience,\" but I never even knew the importance of what you do and what you say, and now I do very well. And it keeps us all in the game. And we just got great polls out of — you probably heard — out of Arizona. We're getting them out of Nevada. You know, the real polls, not the fake polls. We're getting them out of North Carolina, looking really good. I think Pennsylvania's looking good, Florida's looking great. It's all a big, phony deal they have going, Rush. And we're gonna win this. I think it's gonna be a bigger win than we had four years ago.\n— great polls.\nWow.\nWell, I appreciate it. And, you know, when you suggested this, I immediately jumped on it 'cause your audience is the biggest. I mean, it's just incredible. And we have some great friends in Sean Hannity and so many others, you know, Mark and so many people are so great to us. But we have so many people that are so untruthful. And the biggest thing, the one thing I haven't figured out is why.\nIf we say we're gonna create a strong military and protect, we're gonna create a strong economy like we've never had an economy prior to the plague, and now we're building it up again stronger than before. Watch, it's gonna be stronger than before. We're almost at record stock market. Nobody can believe that. We're rounding the turn on the pandemic and I'll have something to say about that because I'm telling you, we have a cure, more than just a therapeutic. We have a cure.\nBut so many things that we've done. And, you know, no matter what you do, they try and find fault. And not only fault, vicious. They're vicious people. And you say, why wouldn't they want to have good education, a good military, a strong economy, safety, security? Why would they want to live like they live in Portland where they just allow these agitators and anarchists to run the streets, why would they want that?\nThat's the only thing I haven't figured out, why would they. And why would these big companies like Comcast, I call it Concast, it's Comcast but I call it Concast 'cause it's a con job, that's NBC mostly. But if you look at CNN, which is so pathetic, why would they do that? Why would they want to have a country that's in turmoil? 'Cause they create it, the fake news is the worst thing we have going. You know, the lamestream, I call it the lamestream media, but you'd think that they'd want to see great education, great country, great security, strong military —\nIt's a crazy thing, Rush. It's one thing — I've never quite figured it out, you know, and they become less wealthy, you know, to a large extent they become less wealthy and they're willing to give up their wealth in order to see the country go to hell. Someday when you figure that out, you're gonna let me know.\nOkay.\nRight.\nI'll tell you, it's such a great question — and I'd do it again, even though it's far worse. I never thought I'd be involved with the Russia hoax or a Ukraine hoax or be impeached because I made a phone call congratulating somebody that I never met or, you know, spoke to on becoming the president of Ukraine and all of a sudden you get impeached and was a perfect phone call.\nYou know, a letter that we actually... Fortunately, we had it transcribed because they made up the phone call. They said it was totally different. Fortunately — or maybe I look at the talking to you right now in this capacity, at least. Fortunately we had it transcribed. It was transcribed the exact call. If we didn't, they would have... You know what Schiff said. He said it before Congress.\nHe repeated my call. It had no bearing on what I said. It was a perfect phone call, and I got impeached over it. I never knew it would be so unpleasant. But nobody has done more in the last 3-1/2 years as president in the first 3-1/2 years that I have. Nobody. I mean, if you look at rebuilding the military and the economy and the best employment numbers we've ever had, and we've cut regulations to a point that's so incredible; nobody's ever seen.\nIf you look at Veterans Choice in the VA accountability... You know, we had people in the VA that beat up our veterans — and beat 'em up badly. You know, they're infirm, they're not well, they're not feeling well, and you had these animals in there that would beat 'em up. We couldn't do anything about 'em. Now, with accountability, you have to account — and we fire 'em and worse. We get rid of 'em.\nAnd our vets have a 91% approval rating, the highest we've ever had in the VA. You don't hear those bad stories about the VA anymore like you used to, and now they get immediate doctor attention if they have to wait on line. But that's so many different things right to try where they can try medicines and I can sort of give you an example of that with the COVID.\nBecause I was in not great shape and we have a medicine that held me, that fixed me. It's a great medicine, and had I not gotten it, Rush, it would have been in line for another year, probably, before they brought it out. Great company — two great companies, actually, make it — you know, make very similar things. But they both work equally well. And we're gonna send it...\nWe're already sending it starting the process. Hundreds of thousands of vials are being sent to the hospitals all over the country. People are gonna get immediately better like I did. I mean, I feel better now than I did two weeks ago. It's crazy. And I recovered immediately, almost immediately. I might not have recovered at all from COVID.\nTo me, it's the biggest story. But the press doesn't even want to report that. They talk about the vaccines. And the vaccines are very important, Rush. But this is more important because we can go in the hospitals and clean out the hospitals literally with people that... The vaccines are very important. It's a different stage.\nThis is the antibody. This is the antibody, and Regeneron. It's the most unbelievable thing I've ever seen. And I had a meeting with doctors today. You know, it's always... The good thing about when our president, 11 doctors show up, and they're all the head of Johns Hopkins and this and that. They're great people. But Walter Reed is an incredible place. These 11 guys came in today.\nThey showed me stats. It's amazing. I don't know I would have... I don't know that... You know, I was not in the greatest of shape. A day later I was fine, maybe perfect, but I was fine. But a couple of days later... Now I'm free. I'm... You know, I feel perfect. I have no... I'm not taking anything. You know, I'm off any regimen that they gave me, but it was primarily this one drug.\nAnd we're sending that and the Eli Lilly version of it, which is very similar. We're sending that to all of our hospitals. We're gonna get people better. We gotta get it there fast. That's why I'm doing an emergency use authorization. I gotta get 'em to approve it really fast.\nI gave them my numbers to put in with the other numbers that they already have, which are very good, excellent, and it's... You know, it's the most amazing thing — and it's not Remdesivir. Maybe that helps a little bit. But Remdesivir is not the same thing. This is stuff that is so good. It just wiped out the virus. It wiped it out —\nIt's such a big story to me.\nRight.\nI feel great.\nNo, no, no.\nWell, there's always that little, lingering thing for a couple of days. But, no, I have a... My voice is now perfect. I mean, for a couple of days, you know it's called the lingering thing. If you have hay fever, if you have something be you have that, too, a little bit. But, no, this is the most amazing thing that's happened, and I was asking the doctors today — 11 guys, great people, the heads of the biggest hospitals.\nIt's amazing. I guess the president has a lot of power, but everybody shows up. \"What do you do?\" \"I'm the head of Johns Hopkins,\" or [chuckles], \"I'm the head of...\" It's always like that, but they're very brilliant people, and I said, \"How bad was I?\" They said, \"You could have been very bad. You were going into a very bad phase.\" So it wasn't like it was just gonna be like with the kids where they get it and they get sniffles and they're better two days later, right?\nThis looks like it was gonna be a big deal — and you know what that means, right? That means bad, 'cause I've lost five people, at least five people that were friends of mine. One in particular, like, an incredible guy who went in there, went into the hospital; he was dead within three days. And I'm just saying that we have something that will cure this now. And a cure. And without us, without the Trump administration, this would never have happened.\nWe poured money into these cures, and we poured money into the vaccines. And the vaccines are coming along great, Rush. I mean, the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer, they're all coming along great. They're a little bit political. They're afraid it's gonna go too fast and I'll get credit for it before the election.\nTrue.\nRight.\nYeah. [chuckles]\nWell, first of all, it's such a great question, and most people can't understand it. As an example, I was nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes. One for —\nOkay.\nOh, that's good. It won't be written about. When Obama got it, it was the biggest story. I remember very well. He didn't even know why he got it. Got it —\nRight.\nThat's right. He didn't know why. He can't explain why he got it, but I can — and one is Middle East peace without any blood, okay? And, by the way, countries are lining up. The other is if you look at Kosovo and Serbia, they've been killing each other forever and I got them to be peaceful and, you know, good stuff. And then I just heard about the third. Nobody even...\nThat wasn't even on the news, okay? You know, I joke about it in speeches sometimes. I'll joke about it. I say I tell my wife, \"Let's watch tonight. It'll be wonderful tonight,\" and they don't even cover it. They don't cover any good stuff with me. Anything that's good they don't cover. Anything that's okay or bad... I mean, bad, they make it sound like, you know, like let's do the electric chair thing.\nBut it is the most dishonest. The media are the most dishonest people I've ever met, and that's why I go back to the original. I just don't know why. I mean, they can't hate somebody so much, but they do. They do it to Republican conservatives. You've had it before I came along, but never... I don't think never to this extent. You know, they say that Newt Gingrich... They said that the one that got worse than me was Abraham Lincoln. I said, \"I disagree.\"\nThey say, \"Abraham Lincoln was decimated by the press.\"\nI said, \"Maybe he was, but it couldn't be worse.\" If I do something good, they make it look bad. If I do something okay, they make it look like horrible, horrible. The reason I talk — I say it. You might as well talk about it yourself because nobody else will. If I give it to our very good people, Kayleigh and, you know, we have a lot of good people at the White House.\nIf I give it to them to go ahead, they won't even — they won't report it. And did you ever see the way the press, the hostility of the press, the way they scream at these very nice people? They'll make just an ordinary statement and they'll start screaming like a bunch of maniacs, the media.\nIt's just incredible.\nThey are sick. You know, it's crazy. But g'head.\nyeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nRight.\nNo.\nYeah.\nYeah, which is false.\nMmm-hmm. Yes.\nWell, Rush, remember how big the wall was. Everything with the wall, the wall, the wall, and it got bigger and bigger because they figured there was no way to get it financed because it's a massive... You know, it's thousands of... The whole thing, it's a massive project. One of the biggest... It's actually one of the biggest projects, government projects ever. Anyway, so we're building the wall.\nWe're up to 380 miles of wall, had a huge impact. Nobody gets through this wall. This wall is everything the Border Patrol wanted. I built it exactly... I didn't even agree with them on certain parts of it, but I think they were right. They had to have see-through, they had to have this, they had to have that, it's lined up with all sorts of wires and everything you can imagine. It is the best, okay?\nIt's the best, and it's had an impact that you wouldn't believe. And nobody thought I was gonna get it done. Now it's almost completed. It will be completed toward the end of the year, very soon, and it will be about 535 miles. We may even extend it beyond that. But, you know, you have a lot of natural barriers — rivers and mountains and other things that really do a pretty good job. [chuckles]\nBut we're gonna have it finished very soon. You don't even hear about it anymore. And you don't hear about how great the border numbers are. You know, people today... I ended catch-and-release, which was not easy, because I had to go through the Democrats. But I had to... You know, used to catch somebody they'd release them into our country, and they'd come back four years later but nobody would ever come back for a court case.\nIt was the craziest thing. You'd catch somebody, even a murderer, and then you'd release them into our country, and then you'd say, \"You have to be back here in 2-1/2 years to go to trial,\" and nobody would come back. Only the very dumbest would come back, okay? And that was about 1%.\nNo, that was about 1%, and it was crazy. Catch-and-release. You know, there were many programs like that. We got rid of most of 'em, and it's not easy to get rid of them. You know, you had to go through all sorts of hoops, but I got rid of catch-and-release. We have a very good border now. Now only people that come in legally are coming in. You know, we have a... Well, the wall made a tremendous difference. But you notice you never hear about the wall anymore?\nNever talk about it.\nRight.\nThat's right. They don't talk about immigration, and we have immigration down really good. In fact, I was gonna do an immigration bill — I have it all done — and then my guys said, \"Why bring it up, Sir? You have the same policies that you're already implementing, and you know, why should you go through the controversy of it?\" I mean, the people that wanted the wall generally love what I've done, and immigration generally. We've got a couple hardliners out there, you know, friends of yours. [chuckle] But the people that wanted the wall — I've done far more than I thought.\nOur immigration now, because it wasn't just — it was the wall, but we had to cut a lot of these crazy things out. I mean, you have chain migration where somebody comes in illegally, and we have a killer who killed eight people on the West Side Highway, ran over eight people, you know, a terrorist, jihadist, came in through the southern border, and through chain migration, the chain, he brings in his mother, his father, his grandmother, his aunts, his brothers, his uncles, he brings in all these people, and I say, \"Wait a minute.\" What we've done is incredible on immigration. Think of it. You have killers that come in and because of chain migration they're allowed to bring other people —\nThey don't want to talk to me about it. So many things like sanctuary cities, you know, the people in California hate sanctuary cities. I don't know where it gets its political stamina, the people in California, they see me all the time — I think we'll do well in California. In theory you don't win California because everybody likes to vote three times if you want to know the truth.\nThe whole thing is crazy, but the people want to vote, they vote numerous times, numerous times, and it's disgraceful. But the people in California, they don't like sanctuary cities. What are you doing with sanctuary cities? You're protecting criminals. Who wants that? And I've had so many people — liberal friends of mine from California, \"We'd love to get rid of sanctuary cities.\" Well, as you know, Kate's Law, remember Kate's Law?\nWe tried like hell to get it passed but, you know, we left the filibuster, okay? We should have gotten rid of the filibuster only because I said Schumer's gonna do — I told Mitch, I said, Mitch, I get along great with Mitch, we had the greatest success in history on judges, we had up to 300 judges and two Supreme Court judges and now three. Hopefully that will go quickly. I think she's gonna go very quickly, so three Supreme Court justices. But in the first term, that's never happened before.\nBut I said the problem is, Mitch, as soon as the Democrats do get in — you know, at some point I guess they get in, they will blow up the filibuster. They'll go nuclear, as you know, and that will be the end of the filibuster and they'll approve stuff left and — you know, left and right, 50%, they'll go left and right. And that's the problem I had with it. It's not that they're not right, they did it the right way. Harry Reid, we got lucky because Harry Reid thought that Hillary was gonna win and he knocked out the filibuster for the judges. Otherwise, I wouldn't have 300 judges, I'd have two judges.\nRight.\nYeah.\nSo, it's such an interesting question because I have done more... You know, we have a list of things that we've done. Just go down the list. Even Space Force. That's a big deal! You know, first in 75 years, right? A new branch of the United States military. That by itself is an achievement that you could just do that, and you've had a successful thing. Space Force. Think of it.\nYou know, the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard. We have Space Force, and that's a big deal. It's gonna be important, especially as the future goes, maybe the most important. But so many things I've done, and you don't... It's incredible. People... You have to sell it yourself because they don't want to talk about it. You don't hear anything about Space Force.\nYou know how big a deal that is? You don't hear about any of this stuff. They don't want to talk about it. But I'll tell you the amazing thing, the one thing I really have learned. The people of our country are smarter than the people that cover them, because they get it. How can I be in a position where I'm leading in a lot of states...?\nI mean, don't believe these fake polls. These fake polls, I don't know if you ever look at them. I don't think they have to put it down. I think there's a legal reason. They put down where they interviewed 18% more Democrats than Republicans; Trump is losing by five. Do you understand what I mean?\nI still don't know why. I think there's a legal reason because they always say who they interviewed. But when you look down at what they call the tabs, one of them said 18% more Democrats. Another one said 14% more. Well, let's assume the Democrats are gonna vote for Sleepy Joe — which is ridiculous, 'cause Joe shouldn't be a candidate. Joe's in no condition to be a candidate.\nWe can say it nicely or we can say it badly. The 25th Amendment that Crazy Nancy is... She's crazy. She's a nut job. But this 25th Amendment, I think it's in so they can get Kamala in to replace Joe.\nThat was the first thing I thought of — and, by the way, the Republicans have been very good to me. One thing the Republicans have to do, though, they have to get tougher. We have some great ones you know that. Jim Jordan, and Meadows has been great. A lot of them have been great. But the Republicans have to get tougher.\nThe tells me they play a much dirtier game. They don't... You know, like impeaching on a phone call. I'll never forget. \"Sir, did you call the president of Ukraine?\" \"Yeah, I did.\" \"Why? Just to congratulate him.\" I had five guys begging me to call him to congratulate him! I never met him before. You know, what do I care?\nSo, they said, \"Did you call the president?\" \"Yes.\" \"What did you say?\" I said, \"I don't know, couple of months ago. I called him to congratulate him 'cause he became president of Ukraine. Why, what's...?\" \"Sir, they want to impeach you for that call.\" I said, \"Impeach me for the call? Impeach me for something...? [laughing] But they can't impeach me. What did I do, say 'congratulations'?\" It's unbelievable. You know, by the way, when they found out, they believed the Schiff version of the call when he made it up standing in front of Congress, okay?\nSchiff is a real crook. He made it up. You know, I said eight times \"quid pro quo.\" Think of what eight times is. That would mean eight times you've asked for something illegal on a call, right? Think of what that means. The person on the other side of the call — if you did it once, maybe, twice, maybe. If you did it eight times they'd think you're certifiably insane, right?\nSo, Schiff made up the call and I said, \"Well, there's nothing wrong with the call. We actually took the call 'cause we had the transcript, fortunately. If we didn't have a transcript, I don't know. It would have been my word against a lot of these crooked people. But if we... I actually sent it to the Department of Justice to some division, and they called up.\nThey said to my people, \"Uhhh, okay. So, what are we looking for here?\" [laughing] In other words, you know, these are guys that look at drug deals and murders and they going, like, \"Okay. Explain to us, what are we supposed to...?\" In other words, having read the call, what the hell is wrong with this thing, right? They impeached me. So, you have to be... They're meaner and they are... But they're bad policy. Open borders, sanctuary cities, high taxes —\n[chuckles] Right.\nRight. It has great potential.\nAnd America has great potential too. Because any shortcomings we can solve those shortcomings, but they're gonna make 'em much shorter. I mean, America has tremendous potential. When you look at what we've done with energy, and they want to take that advantage away and give it to these other countries that are gonna always have energy. When you look at the environment, it's very important — I love the environment. I want clean air, I want clean water —\nIt's unbelievable.\nLike the forest fires in California. If we had forest management, you wouldn't have any forest fires. You know, in Europe you go there, they have forest nations. They call them Austria, different places. They don't have the woods burning down and their trees are more explosive than ours, meaning explosive from potential fire. They have trees. And they have — you know, they maintain their forests. And they put cuts in between so if they have a fire, it doesn't burn down a half a million acres. They do it properly.\nOur people don't do that. And then we talk about, you know, they want our air clean, but they don't talk about China, Russia, India, these other countries where the pollution is massive going up. So we have a clean spot on a massive planet. We have a clean spot, which is a small percentage of the planet, a very small percentage of the planet. And then China's spewing crap and Russia and all of these other — India. And did you ever see what they dump into the ocean that floats into California?\nIt's unbelievable.\nAnd we end up cleaning it up and then they say, well, you know, the environment, the environment. I could tell you hundreds of stories. You know, a lot of what you and I talk about is really based on common sense. You know, people say, \"Are you a conservative?\" I say, \"No, I'm common sense.\"\nYeah, that's true. That's very true.\nIt's great.\nIt's great.\nRight.\nRight.\nI will.\nSo the Democrats are vicious, and they lie. And what they do is, as an example, health care and other things, they have me standing at a grave of a beautiful soldier in an old cemetery, magnificent cemetery. And nobody respects soldiers more than I do, especially whether you're talking about live soldiers or soldiers that gave their lives. And they have a source say these are suckers and losers. This was for a magazine that's third-rate, you know, super liberal, Obama magazine, and it's a quote. They took that quote from one source. I have 25 people that — verbally that, you know, on the record said that was never said. Who would ever say that? Only an animal would say that.\nI know some very bad people. Nobody that I know would say a thing like that. They put it in ads, they make it like I said it. I never said it, just the opposite. I've taken care of the military better than anybody. They do the same thing with health care. They will make up a statement that's so bad. Now, pre-existing conditions I'm totally for, but I'm against Obamacare because Obamacare is too expensive. I already got rid of the individual mandate, which was the worst part of Obamacare. That's where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying for bad health insurance. You understand that, right?\nSo I got rid of it, and I got rid of it through the law, I got rid of it in our tax decrease, we got the biggest tax decrease in the history of our country. We would have never been able to build up the economy if we didn't get that. But one of the things I got in there, I got rid of the individual mandate. And what I want to do is — and we're fighting to terminate — it's sort of I have terminated Obamacare, 'cause once you get rid of the individual mandate it's no longer Obamacare.\nBut I had a choice to make, Rush. It was a big choice. Do I maintain Obamacare, the remnants of Obamacare after the mandate, do I maintain it well, or do I run it badly? I could have done it either way. I have very good people over there. Alex Azar and Seema, the whole group. I said, you know what? We gotta run it as well as it can be run. I have no choice. I could have run it badly and made everybody angry, but I didn't do that. I ran it really well. Knowing that it's run really well it's still no good. You know, it's still not good. It's much better than when they ran it. They couldn't even do — remember they spent $50 million — $5 billion on the server if you remember, they couldn't get the server right.\nOh, yeah.\nThat's correct.\nThat's correct.\nWhat they do is they love to say that I'm gonna get rid of pre-existing conditions. No. I want to terminate Obamacare and then come up with a great — and we have it — come up with a great health care plan that's much less expensive and does include people with pre-existing conditions. That's what I want to do. Now, they'll also say about Social Security —\nThat's right. In order to do that — well, what will happen is if we win, the Democrats will do something to help get health care. I mean, they're gonna come along because they have no choice. They're gonna come along. They have no choice.\nI will say one thing. You know, we talk about unity 'cause I'd like to see the country come together. It's not as easy as people think. But just prior to the plague coming in from China, when the plague came in from China, we had the lowest unemployment we ever had, we had the greatest employment, we were up to 160 million people employment, we never were even close. Everybody had a job —\nThat's right.\nThat's right, Rush. So we had the best numbers ever. We had the highest stock market, although I tell you, we're inches away right now for people's 401(k)s if they held on to their stocks, they're very wealthy right now. And our economy is doing really amazing considering that we're in this pandemic thing sent to us by China. But if you look at what we've done — and people were calling me, Rush, in terms of bringing our country together, that I really had never heard from before. In other words, they were not interested. And they were saying like, let's start getting together. It was coming together. Success was bringing our country together.\nAnd then we got hit by the China plague. But success, Rush, even you might be surprised to hear that. People that you would have said \"no way\" were calling and saying, \"Can we get together?\" And it was coming together, because success — and I've always said, success will bring us together. Our military is strong. When I took over we had no ammunition. We had a case where a general, a certain general, highly overrated general told me, \"We have no ammunition.\" And I said, \"What are you talking about?\" I said, \"No president should ever be told that again.\" Now we have so much ammunition —\nHe said, \"Sir, we have no ammunition.\" Okay? And I said, \"Keep that very quiet.\" And then we started building up and now we have new rockets, new missiles. We have stuff the likes of which nobody — Russia dreams of the stuff that we have. China dreams of the stuff that we have, Rush, and we can't talk about it or we shouldn't talk about it. We have things that — and I hope to God we never have to use it. Our nuclear is all tippy-top now. You don't want to even say it. You know, we have no choice but to say it. We were so far behind. If you look I call 'em Obiden. Obama and Biden, what they did to our military was — it just was horrible.\nThat's right. No manufacturing.\nRight. Right. No. But it was coming together, Rush. And I'm telling you — and you would be a skeptic maybe almost more than —\n[laughing] I think so. That's true.\nG'head.\nYeah?\nRight.\nSo, I've watched this for a long time. I've had it. I've probably been a victim of it — you and I and a couple of others — more than anybody, and we're just the opposite. When they give up, when we're beating 'em, they have nothing else to fall back on but the word \"racist.\" And it's always... That means that when you're winning and you're just knocking the hell out of them, they have nothing else to say; they call you a racist.\nAnd this has been going on for decades. I don't know that you're gonna stop it, but people are wise to it and people are rolling their eyes now. They're rolling their eyes. It is just an incredible thing. The way they use the race word, the racist word is just actually disgusting. I was asked by Chris Wallace — who's third-rate. I was asked by him... He was protecting Biden the other night. It was pathetic. I couldn't even ask him, \"Why did you get $3.5 million from the mayor of — the mayor's wife of Moscow?\"\nWhy did you say a billion dollars, unless you get rid of the prosecutor, and then you give him the billion dollars? And Chris Wallace was — and he was choking like a dog. He wasn't able to answer, and Chris Wallace would go in and save him the whole time. That whole thing was disgraceful.\nWhat?\nNo.\nAll right.\nOh, yeah. Absolutely.\nOkay, go. Go.\nWell, I think it's terrible, and you can look at so many other things. Look at fracking. He went for a whole year saying, \"No way there will be fracking. Mark my words. There will not be fracking,\" and so did Kamala. You know, Kamala. She's another great one, and they talk about fracking —\nI thought she was so... Mike beat her so bad the other night. But she's just not good at what she did. Hey, don't forget, she started out... She went down in the polls. That's usually not the person you want to pick for vice president. But, anyway, the both of them, they talk about fracking like it was the greatest sin on earth; then they get the nomination, and now they're talking about they want to do fracking.\nBut, you know, I find in politics, always follow their first words, because that's where they're going. They have no choice. They agreed with Bernie Sanders and all the people on the manifesto. And if you read that manifesto, that manifesto is further left than Bernie Sanders. Much further left than Bernie Sanders. You know, usually you think they take 'em right. Bernie took 'em left.\nHe took 'em left of where he was. But if you look at the fracking, the coal... You could say the coal. Remember Hillary, three weeks before she went to West Virginia, she was knocking the hell out of coal, and then she forgot she had to go to West Virginia. [chuckles] So she goes to West Virginia and she sat at the table with the miners, and it was just the end of her when she knocked the coal.\nWhat they do with coal now — with clean coal — is amazing. We have more than anybody. What they do with clean coal is amazing. We have more energy than anybody, and these other countries who want to take it away with the Paris Accord and all of this. They want to take away our wealth. They want to take away our jobs, our companies. It is disgraceful.\nWell, basically it's getting energy out of the ground really efficiently and getting every drop of it, and it's created wealth for our country like you wouldn't believe. And it's really been over the last small number of years that that's really become... You know, you used to see these massive oil wells and, you know —\nThey drill sideways. [chuckles] They can drill up and down and around. It's unbelievable, if you ever watched this process, and they just suck stuff out of the ground that is... It's just incredible the technology, and for whatever reason, for our country... You know, we've become the biggest oil producer in the world right now, by far. Not even a contest.\nWe're bigger than Russia, bigger than Saudi Arabia, and to a level that nobody can believe — and I saved the industry. Six, seven months ago when our oil dropped because of the pandemic, I got Russia and Saudi Arabia together — you know, it's good to get along with countries, not necessarily a bad thing, Rush; you understand that — and they cut 10 million barrels a day.\nIt is actually more than that, but they cut, and we saved the oil. We saved 10 million jobs in this country, and yet everybody has cheap gasoline. Look at the gasoline at $2 a gallon. Nobody thought that would be possible. That's better than a tax cut. So, you know, if you want to know the truth... You know, when gas used to go up to five, six dollars and people would say, \"Oh, our country,\" and people would...\nThey couldn't buy cars. They didn't do anything. We have very inexpensive gasoline, and yet it's high enough that we have our energy jobs. We have millions and millions of energy jobs in Texas and North Dakota and Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. So, Biden goes in. Do you notice they never talk about fracking? So, he said no fracking, and he's in Pennsylvania —\nNo. I know. It's incredible what he said yesterday. I couldn't believe it, and that's such a big thing. Think of it. He's in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania's a big, big fracking thing. It's a million jobs. It's tremendous energy. They have low-energy cars —\nHe said just the opposite. He said, \"There will be no fracking,\" and then once he gets to Pennsylvania, he said, \"No, there will be fracking.\" I couldn't get away with that. Nobody could get away with that! But they let him. They don't even ask him a question about fracking. I mean, they don't say to him, \"Well, wait a minute. You said you won't frack and now you're saying you're gonna frack,\" because if Pennsylvania believed that, they couldn't vote for him because he'd put Pennsylvania out of business, along with Ohio and other places.\nNo, he doesn't get called. I will say this, though. The black community gets it. They don't dig him. They don't like him. They don't like him, and I'm getting numbers. You know, we're at 20%, 22%, which, not that I'm proud of that, 'cause it should be 100%. But, you know, if you look at what I've done for criminal justice reform.\nObama couldn't get criminal justice reform done. I did prison reform. The small colleges and universities, historically black, what I've done. I got them funded. They were coming back every year, hat in hand every year begging for money, and I got 'em taken care of for a 10-year period — all funded, fully funded. What I've done is...\nAnd then with Tim Scott, we did the opportunity zones which is the greatest — I mean, the most incredible — thing for the black community, the African-American community, with jobs and everything else. No. I've done more — and I say it. And, you know, at first people said, \"Oh, it's too much to say.\" I said, \"I've done more for the black community than anybody since Abraham Lincoln,\" and it's true. Nobody's done what I've done.\nBut, you know, they don't like Biden. They don't like Biden. He did the super predator stuff, you know, he was the super predator king.\nRight.\nYeah.\nBut he's a different guy there. You know, you could hear by the way he talks. He's out of it. He's out of it. Now, we can't have a president that's out of it because I meet with Xi and I meet with Putin. I meet with all of them.\nThat's right. He's a different guy. He's out of it. He's in a daze. I look at the things he says. I look at what he says. I look at how he says it. He's in a daze — and it's not because he's 78 or whatever he is. 'Cause I know guys that are 92. Bernie Marcus from Home Depot, he's a hundred percent sharp. But Joe is... There's something wrong. We can't have that.\nWe can't have that.\nI agree, but he was not able to answer the Russia thing, and he was choking and he was not able to answer the billion-dollar prosecutor thing.\nYeah.\n[chuckles] I know.\nI know. Highest number ever recorded that they're better off today than they were at any time before — during a pandemic — and that's what I've built. We've built this, and the only reason we're doing well is because the foundation was so strong, Rush. The foundation.\nIf we didn't have a strong foundation, you'd be 1929 — and if he got in, you'll be 1929, because he's gonna raise everybody's taxes. They don't talk about that, either. He's gonna raise everybody's taxes, and you know what else they never talk about? Something that I think is a very important thing: The Second Amendment. They don't say he's gonna take away your guns.\nThey never talk about it.\nYep.\nThat's right. That's right. So, you know, it's pretty crazy. It's amazing that when we sit in the White House... Every once in a while, I'll say, \"It's not fair the way I get treated.\" And then I'm sitting in the Oval Office and I say, \"Oh, this is the Oval Office.\" [laughing]\nSo, it's pretty amazing, and it's because the people get it. The people of this country are really smart, and they do get it, and they can do everything they can — and, again, the only thing is, I don't know why they do it, but they do it. They're very dishonest and evil in many ways.\nBut the people of the country get it.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nYeah.\nWell, I'm glad you said it, because if I say it — and you said before something. \"Why do you say it yourself?\" Because I have to, and because nobody else will say it. You know, I tell that to people, \"You might as well say it yourself because nobody else is going to say it.\" I don't like saying it. I wish other people would say it, and I love that you can say it.\nBut the truth is, I am a wall. [chuckles] Just like the wall we're building, I'm a wall in between this incredible thing that has such potential. We have something with such potential, you have no idea. Even you might not understand. The level of potential of this country is incredible. The people are incredible. The resources. You know, we have wealthy land. We're on top of land.\nThey want to take it away from us. They want to take our wealth away. They want to take our jobs away, our factories away. They want us to be in the same position... You know, we're born on very, very energy... You look at the energy we have, more than anybody in the world. You look. They want to take all of these advantages that we have over other countries and throw 'em away.\nAnd, you know, we have such incredible potential, and they want to... I am a wall between the potential of this country to be better than ever before, and a country that will become a Third World country, a Venezuela. You know, I used to say we could be Venezuela. I used to say it halfheartedly. It's true. It will be just a massive version. If you look at Venezuela, it's a massive version of Venezuela. Venezuela was... You remember Venezuela 20 years ago?\nYou got a lot of wealthy friends.\nVenezuela has gotten so bad, it's unbelievable. They don't have food. They don't have water. They don't have medicine. They have lots of wealth too. They have oil. But they have lots of wealth. But they have nothing. They've gone socialist and probably more. If you look at Kamala, that's more than socialist. You know, she's further left than Crazy Bernie, and this is what they want. They wanted her. I don't know why. I don't know if they're happy with her. I think she's a —\nPerfect.\nAbsolutely.\nPerfect.\nThat's right.\nThat's right. She was so bad, she left before Iowa — and look at Iowa, by the way! You remember the Iowa...? Nobody even knows to this day who won Iowa, right? They went with this scheme that now they want to multiply times a thousand on the voting stuff, and wait 'til you see. I'm sure that you'll have a question about that. But wait 'til you see how bad the ballot thing...\nYou know, all over the country thousands of ballots are being thrown away and defrauded and cut up — and when they talk about other countries coming in? It's a lot easier for them to print illegal ballots — I guess you'd say counterfeit ballots — than some of the other things that you talk about. But this whole... It's one scary thing when they send out millions and millions of ballots.\nAnd you say, \"Who's sending 'em? Where are they sending them? Who's bringing them? Who's reporting them? Who's signing them?\" I mean, millions and millions of ballots. It's a disgrace, and look at all of the bad things that have happened over the last year with the ballots. Look at Carolyn Maloney's race in New York, a small race where so many ballots have been defrauded.\nYes.\nI'd love to.\nOkay.\nWow.\nWell, I'm gonna get that one. I'm gonna have to put that one up pretty soon. But look, I'm honored by it, and with time, more and more people see the things we have done. I've put out lists, and they're pages and pages long. We've done a job, and I'm very honored about it and am very proud of it. We've helped a lot of people. We've helped a lot of people. You know, on the pandemic I was telling you about this medicine. I'm so proud of it.\nPeople don't want to write about it, but that's okay. But this is better than the vaccine, and it's going out literally as we speak. We have the U.S. military logistics; they're bringing it out. This is such a big thing, but we have done such a good job on the pandemic, we get zero credit. You know, we fed these governors whose shelves were empty — and our shelves were empty, too.\nI say, \"Our cupboard was bare,\" and we filled it up with all sorts of stuff and we send it all over the United States and New York. We built them convention centers that they should have used. We sent ships that they should have used instead of putting old people with other people that were sick — and a lot of problems were caused, as you know. But we had... We did such a job. We did such a great job and made some governors look great.\nAnd, by the way, they all say... When we have our phone calls, we'll have 50 governors, they're all saying, \"Thank you, thank you, thank you.\" Rarely do we have anybody speak up, and when we do, we take care of 'em — and then they'll go and speak to press and they'll say, \"Well, the president was okay.\"\nYou know what we've done for them with the ventilators? The ventilators were an impossible situation. We now build more ventilators by five times than anybody else in the world. We're supplying them to the world, and they're very complicated and expensive, you know, et cetera, et cetera. But we've done a great job. But this is a groundbreaker.\nOh, it was amazing.\nOne of the biggest — I guess the biggest, they say — since the Second World War. But you know what? This is the biggest of all. If the Regeneron and the Lilly-comparable drug turns out, this is a cure. This is a therapeutic, call it what you want. I can tell you it's a cure, and I'm talking to you today because of it, you know, 'cause I think I could have been a bad.\nI could have been a bad victim. I fit certain categories [chuckling] that aren't so great, okay? And you better be careful, too, okay? But you won't... I'm telling you, this is a total game-changer. It's so good. And nobody else would have had it. You know, FDA is approving things in one week that used to take three years. And that's only because I'm bugging them like crazy.\nYou know, I go... I drive 'em crazy, I guess, but that's okay. But FDA, Food and Drug Administration, is approving things that, Rush, would have taken years and I'm getting them in a matter of weeks and months, and they're great things. But this is the greatest of them all if this works out, and I'm very sure it's going to.\nWhen was this announced, Rush?\nI think it's terrible.\nI think it's terrible.\nYes.\nIf that's the case, I'm very disappointed. I think it's a terrible thing, and I'll say it to his face.\nThat's a disgrace. I think it's a disgrace. It's an embarrassment.\nI've had to go through it... I've had to go through it twice now with elections and they have... See, this is what I mean with the Republicans. They don't play the tough game. They don't play the tough game. If this were the other side, you would have had 25 people in jail for the rest of their lives with what we found. That's a disgrace.\nOh, are you kidding me? You would have been 20... Look at me! I had to beat off the phony Mueller report. I had to beat off all this stuff. I had to beat off impeachment. I had to beat off Congress, everything else. They then send it to New York, which is all political. They send it into New York, the same stuff into New York. I have to beat that off. You know, they got New York all over. They don't stop. This is a disgrace. If that just came out — and, you know, I purposely tried to stay away from it, because they all say it would be better if I'm not involved. But that's what happens. When I don't —\nI fully declassified everything. Everything's been declassified. They have so much information. They didn't need any more than frankly, Mr. Horowitz, who is an Obama appointment, he wrote a report on Comey that was so bad, it was so bad, I've never seen anything like it. And they should have gone after him just on that. And McCabe, too, you know, took $700,000 from Hillary Clinton —\nYeah.\nIf that's the case — you have to understand I'm hearing this for the first time. And I said it's impossible. So it's okay for me to have to go through investigations during an election, but for them we don't want to upset the applecart.\nThe Republicans don't play the same game.\nWe caught them cold, and we have people that don't know how to do anything about it. It's horrible. If that's the case, I have to check that. I find it hard to believe. Because, you know what? I went through two elections. You don't think that affected '18? I wasn't running in '18, but the whole Russia witch hunt affected the '18 outcome of the election. We lost some congressional seats. People don't say we picked up two Senate seats, but we lost something in '18, you know, we lost something.\nWe lost some seats that we probably could have held on to. We went through the same thing, and it was all phony stuff. Nobody said let's hold it back 'til after the election. But the Republicans don't play the same game. They don't play the same game. I'd be very surprised and I'd be very disappointed. I'll probably be disappointed because this stuff should have come out a year ago anyway.\nThey had everything they needed a year ago.\nI thought it should have come out two years ago, I mean, frankly, as far as I was concerned. Look, if they hold it because of the election, I've gone through two elections now.\nThey started investigating me before I even won the election.\nThey started investigating me when I was coming down the escalator, the beautiful golden escalator as they call it, with the first lady, I was under investigation illegally by these thieves and Comey and crooks. We caught 'em in the act. They were spying on my campaign and then they went for a coup. Nobody said, \"Well, gee, you know, let's hold off the investigation.\" But with them they do. The Republicans don't play it the same way. It's very disappointing.\nLet's let everybody get elected to office and then let's worry about it. First of all, if we don't win this election that whole thing's gonna end, okay? And you just remember that. That's another thing I'm fighting for because these people have to be brought to justice, but they should have been brought to justice before the election. But if we don't win this election, if we don't win, that whole thing is gonna be dismissed.\nJust keep up the anger, keep up the genius, because they're genius, they get it better than these guys that are looking at stuff. I'm telling you, they get it better. The American public gets this better than the so-called people that are looking — you know, when I look at the Times and the look at the Washington Post, fake papers, both of them, and they get Pulitzer Prizes for the Russia investigation, but they were all wrong. There was no collusion. So they get Pulitzer Prizes —\nNo, none of it. And the guys that did get it right, they don't get Pulitzer Prizes. You know, and you and I can name 10 of them, okay? You're one of them, but you don't care about Pulitzer Prizes. But the ones that got it, they don't get anything. But just, Rush, take a look at how wrong these people were. And they pretend they know me, Maggie Haberman, all of these people, I have nothing against them. But they don't know me. They don't know me.\nI haven't seen her, I haven't spoken to her in a year and a half. You know, you take one picture with somebody, it ends up being like the best friends for the rest of your life, you know, take a picture at the Oval Office with a photographer, with a reporter. And then they write as though you can't live without 'em. I don't even speak to these people.\nBut look at the bad reporting that they've done. Look how wrong they were about everything. They got Pulitzer Prizes for — the Pulitzer organization, frankly, is a disgrace. They gave Pulitzer Prizes to everybody that shouldn't have gotten 'em.\nYou know, they were all wrong.\nThe people that should get the Pulitzer Prizes didn't get 'em.\nNothing.\nYou would think they'd want to take back the prizes on the basis they made a mistake. You would think the committee would meet and say, \"I'm sorry, but you got it wrong, we're gonna have to remand, we're gonna have to take back the prizes.\" But, Rush, think of it. They were totally wrong, and they all got Pulitzer Prizes. And then they go into another story, it's the same stuff. It's so disgraceful when you look at what's gone on. It's so dishonest. And they knew it. And Mueller was a fraud. The whole thing was a fraud.\nThey were just thugs. Thugs. And I'll tell you something. A friend of mine said, you must be — a friend of mine who is a very smart, very successful guy, lawyer — said you must be the most honest guy in the world. You've gone through three and a half years of investigations. They found nothing. And they've gone through my taxes. They've gone through everything. Hey, they spent $48 million, I think the last number I heard was 48 million, investigating me.\nThey've gone through my taxes, they've gone through everything you can imagine at a level that nobody can even believe. Nobody's ever had to put up with, and no other president should have to put up with this. But then I hear that they're not gonna do the thing before the election. Why? Because they're afraid they're gonna influence the election. Because that's the way the Republicans are, they play so nice all the time.\nThat would be very disappointing if Bill Barr actually made that statement, I would be very disappointed in him. I don't know that he made that statement. But if he did do that I'd be very disappointed.\nWell, they've had plenty of time to do it. They've been looking at it for two years. The facts are on the table. All you have to do is take a look at Horowitz report on Mueller. Even the New York Times on Mueller, especially what they wrote about — what they read about this idiot, Comey, the world's worst FBI director, but not only that, it's very dishonest guy.\nThey're totally aware. No, they're totally aware. Even the other side's aware of it. The other side laughs about it. They can't believe they got away with it, if you want to know the truth. You know, they're not stupid. They're very smart. The other side laughs about it. It's not like they believed the Russia thing, they don't believe it. They laugh about it.\nThey tried to a takedown of a very legitimately — in fact beyond, because I was fighting — little did I know when they started this investigation, which was long before the presidential — before the race. After I won, they tried to take me out. Before I won they tried to, you know, it was a fraud. It was the Russian witch hunt.\nHey, Rush, you know, this better than anybody. And Putin I guarantee you says this to everybody. Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. I got NATO to pay $410 billion more — —\n— protect against Russia. I was the one that exposed Nord Stream, the pipeline going into Germany. I said, wait a minute. You're paying Russia billions of dollars, and we're supposed to protect you from Russia. What kind of a deal is this? I was the one that gave tank busters to Ukraine and Obama gave 'em pillows. Remember the pillows, probably from the pillow man on Fox. But Obama gave 'em pillows and sheets.\nAnd I gave 'em tank busters. I gave them money. Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have. Nobody.\nRight.\nYeah.\nYep.\nShe deleted 33,000 emails, she should be in jail for that. I don't care if they're very highly confidential emails, I don't care what. She deleted — she got a question, she got a statement from Congress, a subpoena from Congress. Everybody, we want your emails, all of Hillary Clinton's emails, 33,000 of them, she deleted them, she acid washed them and she broke her telephones with a hammer, okay? Broke 'em with a hammer.\nAnd, by the way, speaking of that and speaking of Bill Barr, 31 people deleted their telephone messages from the Mueller report, okay? And they said they all made a mistake. Well, they made the same mistake? Chances are a billion to one that they would have made the same mistake, 31 phones were wiped clean on the Mueller report. I want to see those phones, right? And how do you allow — 31 phones, I think it was 19 people, 31 phones — you read about it just recently — they want the phones 'cause they want the information on the phones, because we caught them cheating. And they were all wiped clean or most of them were wiped clean. We have a couple, believe it or not. But they were wiped clean. They were deleted. Everything was deleted and cleansed. And you're not allowed to do that. They broke the law. Nothing happens to these people.\nBut they go after General Flynn. They go after Papadopoulos. They go after all these people. It is a disgrace. And one of the reasons I want to win so badly is we gotta finish this thing off, and I will be very disappointed if that Axios piece that you read to me is true. I'll be very disappointed, 'cause they've had plenty of time to get this done, plenty of time.\nI don't think the debates mean that much, and I'll tell you why. I've done well with debates, I won — I guess I had 15, I think I won every single poll. I won the poll on this one with him, but I had to be rude because he was lying, he'd get up and just say a series of things that were all lies, and I'd say \"false,\" and they'd say I interrupted him. But, you know, if you look at the polls, most polls say I won it with him. But it was a very interesting thing. I'd rather let him speak because he's gone, he's mentally gone, and eventually he goes off track and he'll start talking about the birds and the bees.\nBut I couldn't do that because he was saying so many false things. He'd say about the soldiers, he'd say about Social Security, which I'll protect and he won't protect, by the way. He's not gonna protect — he doesn't know what it is. He'll say about Social Security, he'll say about — and if I didn't say \"wrong,\" you know, et cetera, et cetera. But the one who protected him was Chris Wallace. And, by the way, Fox is a whole different ball game. You know, Fox is a much different thing than it was four years ago.\nSomebody said what's the biggest difference? I said the biggest difference is Fox. You take a look at Fox — we have our great ones, Sean and, you know, a number of them, but Fox is a whole different ball game. And, you know, Paul Ryan is on the board of Fox. I'm sure that has something to do with it, but Fox is a whole different ball game. Somebody said to me, what's the biggest difference? I said the biggest difference is Fox is no longer the same. Big difference.\n— your all-time biggest audience.\nBut I can talk to you. Now, let's say no, I don't want to do it or I want to be shy, I don't want to talk, you know, too many people, you know, let's not talk. No. You have such an incredible audience. So I can tell them about Fox being a big obstacle. It's a problem. Fox is a problem. When Roger Ailes ran Fox, I mean, Roger had a very strong point of view. It's totally gone. And I think it's influenced by Paul Ryan. He's on the board. I can't believe it. Here's a guy who failed as Speaker. Do you know that Nancy Pelosi issues a subpoena like it's cookies, right? Everything you do, \"Did you make a phone call 12 years ago?\" Oh, issue a subpoena. You couldn't get a subpoena out of Paul. When we had —\nI deal with 'em. I deal with 'em. But they've gone a very different path. It's a much different group. They have guys on there that are so bad, they have people, I call 'em the twins, Chris Hahn and —\nNo, he works for Schumer. They're Schumer people.\nHow about when they hire Donna Brazile who gave Hillary the questions to the debate?\nWho got fired, by the way, Donna Brazile got fired from CNN and then Fox hires here. Got no credibility. It's not like she's great entertainment. It's not even good entertainment.\nWhen they do that, when they put somebody like a Donna Brazile in — not that she's effective. She's not effective —\nIt's a shame. You know, Fox should grab it and they should say, hey, we got the president and we're gonna defend our president, but they're not. They're going the way of CNN. And they're going the way of MSNBC, and it's a shame. I mean, it's a shame. When I watch it, I look at the people they hire. I mean, I could tell you some of the anchors, they're so bad. They're so bad. And at the same time, Fox & Friends is terrific in the morning, you know, they're good.\nWell, I have to be. I have no choice because otherwise you couldn't survive it. Sean is great. And Tucker is pretty good, you know, Tucker has his moments in all fairness, but Tucker is pretty good. And Laura's been great and, you know, we have a lot of good stuff. But Fox is 50% of what they were — I would say less than 50, but 50% of what they were. That's still better than nothing. At some point maybe they'll go all of the way and that will be fine too. I'll figure that out. I have to figure out —\nYep.\nBecause they're ratings have died.\nI tried to help the NFL and then Roger, nice guy, Goodell, in his basement wearing a very tight blue T-shirt, you know, and he's not meant for it, nor am I, nor are you, it's just one of those things, you know, at a certain age you put on a tie, right? But what happens is he brought it up again. I said to him, \"I thought I taught you a lesson two years ago about standing for the flag.\" Their ratings went down the tubes and now you look at everybody with their hands in the air and they're kneeling and I just don't have the same interest. And neither do a lot of other people, Rush.\nThe NBA has become so political that nobody cares about it anymore.\nI don't even know who's playing in the finals. I don't know anybody that's watching the NBA. LeBron has been a spokesman — I don't know him, I never met him. All I know is when he endorsed Hillary, I said, that's the greatest endorsement I've ever seen because when he endorsed Hillary four years ago, she came up to his knee. I said, that is not the best-looking president I've ever seen.\nThey were standing, no, she was up to about his knee. Literally I've never seen — and I said, \"That's not good.\" But LeBron is a spokesman for the Democratic Party, and a very nasty spokesman. Because, again —\nI've done so much for the black community. And people don't want to see that. And he's a great basketball player. But people don't want to see a guy that's that way. They don't want to see that. You know, we have enough difficulty during the week. You don't want to sit down and watch a basketball game and then watch somebody that hates your guts, okay? And he's a hater.\nSo I look at it, and I look at the NBA, and I can't watch it. And nobody's watching it. And their ratings are down the tubes. And I'm telling you, I haven't watched a basketball game in a long time. I have no interest in doing it. And, you know what? That's a very sad commentary, 'cause I'd love to. But I just don't have any interest in it anymore. Other things I do, I have great interest, but they're hurting themselves very badly.\nAnd now I understand — don't forget, Black Lives Matter, what was Black Lives Matter? Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon. The first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, I said that's such a terrible term because it's such a racist term. It's a term that sows division between blacks and whites and everybody else. And it's a very bad term, for blacks. But they were very angry. It's a Marxist organization.\nIt's \"pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.\" Who were they referring to? New York City policemen. Okay? And I said, wow. And if you would have told me that was gonna go mainstream. But it never did go mainstream.\nAbsolute heroes.\nYeah.\nYep.\nYeah, well, it's radical liberal Democrats. Look. New York — Rudy was a great mayor. Rudy was our greatest mayor by far. He did things that were incredible and brought back New York. But it was easier in a way because the police had total respect. There was crime and everything, but the police were the police. When they dumped water a year ago on the policeman's head and he didn't do anything about it, like turn around and slug the guy, when they did that, I don't know if you remember New York's finest, New York's finest, these are great police. You know, I got endorsed by New York's finest one month ago. And it's the first time in the history of New York City that they've endorsed a presidential candidate.\nEverybody.\nI don't think anybody — in fact I asked Biden at the debate, and of course Chris Wallace cut it off, didn't think it was appropriate. I said name one police organization that endorsed you, Joe. Then I said, say law and order, Joe, just law and order. He wouldn't do it.\nHe wouldn't do it. Then I think he said law and order and safety. I said, no, no, no, just law and order, law and order means safety. You don't have to add the word safety. You know, that's their little net. Let me tell you, if he got in this country's going to hell. This country's gonna go to hell like you've never seen and you'll end up in a depression the likes of which you haven't seen since 1929.\nYour taxes are going up, your regulations — you know, I did the biggest tax cuts in history, bigger than Reagan's tax cuts, I did something that was more important. I cut regulations. That you couldn't build a highway in less than 10 years. It would take you 10 years to get approvals and some much longer than that. One was 21 years and they ended up not getting it. You couldn't get anything done. And I cut regulations to a level that now you can get things done or not done in one year. In other words, it may get disapproved because it's not safe or environmentally good or a lot of good reasons.\nBut I cut regulations from 19 years to one year. I mean, you wouldn't even believe it. People had to go through the same agency 14 different times —\nI have to be the one, yeah. Nobody else seems to be able to tell it properly.\nSo I'd like to see it happen because it wasn't — look. A lot of people are being hurt because of China. It wasn't these people's fault. I would like to see a bigger stimulus package, frankly, than either the Democrats or the Republicans are offering. I'm going in the exact opposite now, okay? I mean, I'm telling you this, I'm telling you something I don't tell anybody else 'cause maybe it helps or maybe it hurts negotiations.\nI would like to see a bigger package. I'd like to see money going to people. It was not their fault that China sent in the plague. It wasn't their fault. And China's gonna pay a big price. You know, China was gonna catch us in 2019. If you look back 15, 20 years ago, everybody said by 2019 China will beat us. I was beating them so badly — you know, we were doubling up, we were doing great, until the plague came in. And we're still beating them badly. We'll still be. If you have a smart guy atop, you'll always beat 'em. You know, they're paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs. People don't realize when I made the deal, they're paying billions, I gave a lot of —\nBillions of dollars. Well, they devalue their currency and they make it impossible to compete because they devalue their currency, you know, they're currency manipulators, and devalue their currency, and therefore the dollar, they're using dollars of a different value and it makes it very easy for them to compete, whereas we don't do that. We don't play games like that. Some people say we should. I don't have a viewpoint. But they devalue their currency and do all sorts of things.\nAnd what they do in the World Trade Organization, you know, we just won a case, seven and a half billion dollars, first time we've won a case in a long time. I said, look, I'm gonna get out of the World Trade Organization if we have to just like I got out of the World Health. So we were paying $500 million a year in World Health, China's paying $39 million a year in World Health. They're a bigger country. I said, \"Why are they paying so much less?\" You know, little stupid questions like that. Nobody could give me an answer, and yet they dominate the World Health, they dominate, World Health, okay? And World Health, when they did this horrible thing to us, World Health did nothing whatsoever to help us. We're at $500 million here, so I terminated the deal.\nTotally in the tank.\nBy the way, same thing about world trade. You know, in world trade China is considered a developing nation. If you're a developing nation you get tremendous advantages in the World Trade Organization.\nA hundred percent. And I ended that. I said I'm not gonna accept that they're a developing nation. I wouldn't say China's in love with me, by the way. China is dying. Here's what will happen, just a couple of predictions. If I win we'll have a great deal with Iran within one month. They're dying to have me lose, but if I win —\nOn no nuclear weapons.\nDon't forget, look at what's happened to terrorism. Iran was a very wealthy nation, given $150 billion plus $1.8 billion in cash by Obama, a very wealthy nation, and now they're a very poor nation. And the terrorists organizations, I knock on wood as I say it 'cause it's easy to start something, they're not fighting like they used to. You know why? Because they have no money because Iran is bust. Iran is bust because of me, because of sanctions and other things. And the whole picture of terror — you don't see the terror. You know, I hate to say it on an important show like this, but I'll say it, you don't see the terror the way used to see the terror.\nAnd they know if they do anything against us they'll pay a thousand-fold problem. They're gonna have a thousand-fold difference because they know now that we have things that we never had before. We have strength in weapons that we never had before. We never had it like we have it now and Iran knows that. They've been put on notice, if you fuck around with us, you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before and they understand that. But here's the thing, they're no longer rich and they're not giving out hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas and all these other groups that caused all the problems. Now, nobody brings it up. When was the last time you saw an attack —\nRight.\nWell, Rush, I appreciate that very much. It's an honor.\nI know you do. And this is the most important election that we've ever had. And I used to say '16. I don't even get into that anymore. That's over. This is the most important election this country has ever had on so many different fronts. There's never been anything like it. We will go the way of failed nations all over Latin America, South America. We will go the way of failure like nobody's ever seen and in a scale like nobody's ever seen it. We've been taken advantage of by every nation in the world, including our friends. Our friends sometimes are worse than our enemies.\nWhat I've done with NATO, we were taking care of virtually a hundred percent of the military needs of Europe, guarding them from Russia at the same time they were taking advantage of us on trade, and in many ways they were worse than China. Europe was worse to us on trade than China was. And I changed so many things. But, you know, then they say, \"Oh, in Germany they don't like Trump as much as they like Obama.\" Well, of course they shouldn't like me, because Germany was taking advantage of us like few countries took advantage —\nNobody even knew about that pipeline until I brought it up. I said, \"Why are you paying Russia billions of dollars and we're protecting you, tell me what kind of a deal is this, we're protecting you, but you're giving Russia -\"\nShe's smiles because she's a very smart one, she knows it, there's no way she can answer the question. I say, \"You don't have to answer the question, Angela.\" I like Angela. But you know she's a player. I said, \"Angela, don't answer the question because I don't want to embarrass you.\" There's no way she can answer the question because she gets away with it, that's why. She's a very smart, cunning person. But I caught 'em.\nHey, Rush, I got them to pay $130 billion going to $410 billion more each year against Russia. Now, I get along with Putin. I like Putin. Putin probably, possibly likes me but I guarantee you one thing he would have much rather seen Crooked Hillary and I guarantee he'd rather see Biden 'cause Biden is slow. Biden is not equipped to be president. He never was at his best. But he is not equipped now. It's no longer prime time. And not because he's 78. Because, frankly, at 78 as we said before, I know the sharpest people, they're 85, they're 80 — it's not at age — now they're all saying, \"Oh, he's 78.\" It's not because he's 78. There's something wrong with him, okay? And we can be nice about it. We can —\nNobody wants to say it. Nobody wants to say it. But his thoughts are bad — here's a guy. You talk about access to the press. I've never seen this before and I've watched a lot and I don't know how it gets away. You saw that NBC joke the other night, it's like a child, like you're asking a child questions. They don't talk to me that way. When you you look at the questions that he gets and then he reads the answers off a computer. Now, that means that these supposedly legitimate, but they're not legitimate — you know that better than I do — these news organizations are giving him questions, they're putting them in a computer, he's reading the answers off a computer.\nI never heard of that before. I've never done that. Can you imagine? Give me the questions and I'm gonna give you an answer off a computer? He's reading the answers off a computer a lot of times. And if he doesn't do that he's all mixed and befuddled. And Chris Wallace saved him three times the other night. I mean, he was getting ready to crack, and Chris Wallace, who was terrible, by the way, who I think really embarrassed himself and Fox the other night, but Chris Wallace saved him. But can you imagine, you're getting the answers to questions and you're getting the questions themselves, and you're reading the answers —\nOne thing I'll say, Hillary was much smarter. Hillary's a much smarter person, you know, I mean, look, Hillary was smart.\nI understand, but Hillary was, you know, Hillary didn't need to have answers read. You know, she could answer a question. Joe cannot answer a question. They ask him a question, a very simple question, and he's reading it off the computer. He's saying, \"Move the computer, bring it closer.\" He couldn't see it, \"Bring it closer.\"\nOn a question that anybody could answer. I mean, it's a very simple question. We can't have this. We can be nice. And maybe I'll lose 'cause they'll say I'm not a nice person. I think I am a nice person. I help people. I like to help people. But we can't have this as our president. We really can't, Rush.\nYou're right. We would be. But still, that's a much different man talking there than you see now.\nMuch different man.\nYep.\nRight.\nWell, look. Absentee ballots where you send in for your ballot... You know, I have an absentee ballot in Florida. You send in and you have to request it, and they send it to you.\nThat's okay. It's not easy, but it's okay. You know, some people just can't do it. But they send it and it's called \"absentee.\" I call it a \"solicited ballot.\" I like that term better. You solicit and they send it and you fix it and you send it back. Okay. That's one thing. But they're sending out millions and millions of ballots. Are they sending them to all Democrats?\nWho are they sending them to? Where are they going? You know, et cetera, et cetera. This is going to be the second biggest political scandal in history. The first biggest is the Russian crap that we've been going through for 3-1/2 years. That's the biggest. To me, that's the biggest scandal, biggest political scandal in history —\n— what we've been going through, and now they delay it? You're telling me they delay it? That's gonna be my first phone call, by the way.\nI think it's just a disgrace. If that's a case, it's a disgrace. I'll say it to anybody who wants to say it. But the biggest scandal of all time; this will be the second biggest scandal. Every day, I'm seeing accounts of ballots that are thrown away. You saw the military ballots that were thrown away with my name on it the other day. Every day you see scandal about these millions of ballots that's being sent out. It's the single biggest risk in this election.\nWe are. I have —\nWe have many lawyers, and we've actually been winning many cases. How about where they have the ballots counted and the ballots have to be in by November 3rd, Election Day, but they don't have to be counted for two weeks later? Well, that means you're never gonna know who won the election.\nYou know, it's gonna be two weeks later. I want to know on November 3rd who won the election; so do you. You want to turn on your television like we have for the last 50 years and find out who won the election, right? You don't want to say, \"Oh, gee, they have two weeks to count their ballots,\" and then what happens is all sorts of ballots start showing up miraculously.\nWe're watching it very closely, and we're winning a lot of cases, Rush. You don't see it too much. We just won a big case in North Carolina. We just won a big case in Pennsylvania — I think we're going to win. We're winning a lot of cases. In Rhode Island, we won a big case, where the ballots have to be done in a certain way. But the best way is to get up...\nNow, I tell you what. Our people, your people, my people, Republican people, they get out — and they're all my people, as far as I'm concerned. Everyone's my people. But Republicans tend to get out and vote, and that's what they should do: Early voting, but at a machine. Early voting or voting on November 3rd.\nAnd wait 'til you see the kind of love that's gonna be expressed the day those polls open. The day those machines open, wait 'til you see. But the Democrats are sending in 80% of theirs by ballot. Now, one thing we've noticed from what I hear and from what I'm reading is a lot of the ballots, all they're doing is taking from people that would have voted in the first place.\nThey're not a lot of new voters. You know, we have many more registered voters. We picked up a lot of voters, the Republicans. I think you're gonna see a very, very big explosion when those polls open up, Rush. But a large percentage — like 80% of the Republicans — want to vote. They want to actually go to a poll and vote.\nWhereas it's almost the opposite, for whatever reason, with the Democrats. I think you're gonna see a very big explosion of voting —\n— which is illegal, in many cases, even with the laws that are being passed, where they go around and they start picking up everybody's votes, you know. We have a big enthusiasm gap. Our gap is so much more enthusiastic — you know, like 30-35 points. It's a... There's been a gap of that a lot of people between, let's say, me and him, that there is. Look at the boat shows. I mean, thousands of boats in the oceans, in the lakes —\n— and all over these tractor trucks.\nRight.\n[chuckling] Thank you.\nBy a lot. I know.\nThey say, \"Who is your neighbor gonna vote for?\"\nAnd they're all saying \"Trump.\"\nThey know their neighbors. No, because people don't want to get involved. I mean, you know, even the signs. We have signs all over the place. We have signs in states. But they steal the signs. People steal the signs. They're stealing. It's a well-known thing. They're stealing the signs. Our enthusiasm is far greater than it was four years ago — far greater — because they love the job we're doing, and they know this pandemic was a horrible thing that happened to us.\nIt should have never been allowed to happen by China. China's gonna pay a big price, and it's one of those things, but it happened. And we've done a great job on it, we got no credit. I'll tell you what. If this turns out to be right, that this medicine is going to make people better, that's a game-changer like nobody's ever seen before. And it's gonna happen. It's gonna happen, Rush.\nIt's all right.\nThat's true. That's true. But it's an honor. It's an honor to be with you for two hours. You have no idea. It's a great honor.\nYeah.\nIt is.\nIt is, largely, and you know what I say oftentimes when people say that? \"I have no choice. I have to do it. I have no choice,\" and that's what I'm doing.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-rush-limbaugh-the-eib-network"}
{"Title": "Interview with Dr. Marc Siegel and Tucker Carlson of Fox News", "Date": "2020-10-09", "Text": "Okay.\nSounds good to me, Marc.\nI feel really good. I feel very strong. I know a lot of people that have had the COVID or the China viruses I call it because it came from China, but I feel really, really strong. And a lot of people don't feel that way sometimes for a while afterwards, but very good.\nI think didn't feel strong. I didn't have a problem with breathing, which a lot of people seem to have. I had none of that, but I didn't feel very strong. I didn't feel very vital. I didn't feel like the president of the U.S. should feel, and I knew there was something a little bit off. And the doctors at Walter Reed were incredible. They came from Johns Hopkins. They came from everywhere. It's good to be president, I guess, but they were really great people, but I would say more weakness than anything else Marc.\nI did negotiate, but ultimately I have a lot of respect for these doctors. They're really the best doctors, I think in the world and Walter Reed, I've seen the work they do in the military and people coming in so badly injured like you've never seen before. I have a lot of respect, so I really tended to listen, but generally, maybe I wouldn't, but I did tend to listen to this group.\nI just think that you were tired. It was just getting to you from the stand point you didn't have that same energy level. And my life is based a little bit on energy and you didn't have it. And I don't know, it could have led to bad things from that point. I don't know, but I got lucky, I think with a certain medicine, but it really was something. I took a certain medicine that was very miraculous to me. I think I really don't believe it's just in the head either. I really believe it worked.\nWell, I took the Regeneron and Eli Lilly makes a very similar medicine, but you have Regeneron, you have the Eli Lilly version of it. And within a period of 24 hours, I felt very different. I think I could have left the hospital a lot earlier, but it made a tremendous difference Marc, and markedly so, and I just felt very good. You would have sort of a sore throat just to add to what we were saying, but I felt really very, very good after taking this for a period of time, it's a transfusion, not a shot. And I'd like to send it to everybody. In fact, I've said, I'm going to send it to everybody that's got the problem and we're going to send it free of charge, including seniors, of course, but we're going to send it to everybody.\nI did.\nThey wanted to keep me for observation. They wanted to be sure it was good, but I did. I was there for, I guess three and a half days. They wanted to keep me, I wanted to leave after the first day, I really felt I was in not bad shape after the first day. I think I would have been a much worse shape had I not taken this medication.\nI don't know exactly, but they kept me for the time I stayed for the time that they needed me. And they've done a lot of tests. They've done tremendous testing. And right now I'm medication free. I'm not taking any medications as of probably eight hours ago or so, I'm medication free, which frankly makes me feel good. I don't like medication.\nYeah, they tested the lungs. They have incredible equipment at Walter Reed. In fact, they said, no, you could leave your jacket on. That's the first that's ever happened. Leave your shirt on, leave your jacket on. I said, \"I'll take it off anyway, if you want.\" But literally, they tested the lungs, they checked for the lungs and they tested it with different machinery. They have incredible stuff that I've never even seen before. And it tested good. Initially, I think they had some congestion in there, but ultimately it tested good and with each day it got better. And I think that's why they wanted me to stay, frankly, but the CAT scans were amazing. The equipment was incredible. I've never seen equipment like this before.\nWell, I had tremendous numbers of people, I could hear them from the hospital and I was way up high in this very fortified military hospital that's built to the highest standard. And yet through these very powerful windows, I could hear people screaming and shouting and with love, with real love. And after two days, I said, \"I want to go out and say hello to the people.\" And I went to secret service, and these are the people that are with me all the time. And they said, \"We have no problem, sir.\" I said, \"I just want to take a drive by them and just wave.\"\nAnd you saw what happened. It was a great display of love out there. I don't think there was one negative person and there were many, many, many people, but I don't think there was anybody negative out there. They went crazy when they saw the car go by. And the people in were protected, they were very heavily protected because at that time, I guess I would have been positive, but they were very, very protected. And they've been with me for a long time and they understand, but they also thought it was very important. I thought it was very important to show my affection for them. They were standing out there 24 hours a day, you saw that. I mean, every time you'd be on television, you see them in the background.\nAnd I just thought, I love the people, I love the people of this country. And I thought it would have been very disrespectful if I was there for three and a half days. And these people are there standing late at night, early in the morning and I didn't go out and at least give them a little wave. And that's what I did, and I'm very glad I did it.\nIt's such a great question. I think the biggest thing is that I did do it early. Now, I have such great access to medical. We have a white house doctor, who's great. And you have so many great doctors. So it's a lot easier for me than somebody that doesn't have access to a doctor so easily where it's a big deal to see a doctor, but here we have them all over the white house, frankly, they're watching every corner. But I think very important for me was very early, as soon as I felt something and I'm thinking about it because I see what's going on and a lot of people are around me, even though there's tremendous testing, but a lot of people are around me.\nSo I think about it and I know there's a danger, but I can't be somebody that goes into a basement and just hides in a basement for the rest of my life. I'm running a country, the greatest country in the world. So what I think the big secret for me was I got there very early and I think it would have gotten a lot worse. One of the doctors said he thought it would have gotten a lot worse. I just think that even these medications, there are lot better if you get them early than if you get them late, it will react probably better. So I think going in early is a big factor in my case.\nNo, I didn't even know I had it. I didn't know what it was. It's a form of a steroid, but it keeps the swelling down of the lungs as I understand it. And I tolerated it very well. I don't take it anymore, but it was a pretty short term during the course of the medicine, that was one of the medicines and no, I think I tolerated it very well, Marc, and it keeps the swelling down. And that's important.\nI think really nothing. We pretty much finished and now we'll see how things go, but pretty much nothing. We had our final doses of just about everything. Actually, the original transfusion that's supposed to last for about four months, the antibodies, and I think you're supposed to be protected anywhere from two to four months. And maybe longer than that, I don't know.\nWell, I will. Nobody's asked me that question actually, but I will. If they want me to do it, I'd love to do it.\nI have been retested and I haven't even found out numbers or anything yet, but I've been retested and I know I'm at either the bottom of the scale or free.\nI don't know. Probably tomorrow, Marc. They test every couple of days, I guess, but it's really at a level now, that's been great to see it disappear.\nWell, I'd have no trouble with it at all. In fact, where we have rallies outside, we've had no problem whatsoever. Outside is better than inside as you know with this crazy thing that's going on. But I would have no problem with it. But we've always had a problem with this commission. This commission has been ridiculous, frankly, but who wants to do a debate on a computer? I don't. Virtual debate no, you got to be there. We degraded the last debate. You have to be there. You have to see the person, you can't do it on a computer. Besides that, Joe has a tendency to get the answers and read them off a computer for when he's asked questions. So I would love to do it outside would be fine as far as I'm concerned.\nI don't know. They had some big events at the white house and perhaps there, I don't really know. Nobody really knows for sure. Numerous people have contracted it, but people have contracted it all over the world. It's highly contagious. That's one thing you learn, this is a contagious disease, and generally you get better from it, but we also now have medicines that will help a lot. And if you look at mortality rate, I think it's up 95 or 85%. Marc, I think you've seen that you pointed it out to me. What we're doing now with the medicines and all of the things is incredible, but especially younger people, I wished they open schools, I hope they opened schools. Some of the States are closed and the cure is worse than the problem itself in many cases, it's a terrible thing.\nI just have such great respect for the doctors and lab scientists, the people that work on this, they're doing incredibly well. I have incredible respect and love for the families that have suffered so badly. This is something that came to us out of… I don't know, I won't be able to tell you yet. Maybe at some point I'll be able to report exactly why it came to us, but it came out of China. It shouldn't have happened. They should have never let it happen, but they suffered plenty also far more than people understand, but this is something that should not have been allowed this to come out to the world, not only to the United States to the world.\nBut I have such respect for the people that have suffered and my sympathies to those families that have been so horribly hurt and just horribly hurt. And again, the respect for the doctors and for the technicians and for the scientists is incredible because I've seen what they've done. And it's incredible the job that they've done in a short period of time, over a six month period the job that they've done is incredible. And you'll see that very soon with the medicines and with the vaccines.\nWell, thank you very much, Marc. It's my great honor. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-dr-marc-siegel-and-tucker-carlson-fox-news"}
{"Title": "Presidential Debate at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee", "Date": "2020-10-22", "Text": "So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It's all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\nIt is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\nJohnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\nNo, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\nI don't think it's going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, 'Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.' But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said 'It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.' Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\nI did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don't know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can't do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here's — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\nExcuse me.\nI take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves.\nLook, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You're xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\nYou certainly did.\nHe thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That's obvious.\nWell, I think we have to respond, if I might.\nThank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it's their immune system.\nI want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\nI will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\nNew York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\nWhen you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\nI'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, 'don't wear masks.' He did say, as you know, 'this is not going to be a problem.' I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, 'this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.' When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, 'don't wear masks.' Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here's his exact words: 'This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.' So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\nI don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don't tell me about wall street.\nWell, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow's wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\nFirst of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\nExcuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\nI get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\nI was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\nCould I just — one thing.\nHis son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That's 100% dishonest.\nI have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\nExcuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\nExcuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n— after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\nFirst of all, China is paying. They're paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\nI just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\nIt's what?\nNo, the taxpayers. It's called China.\nChina pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\nThat is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\nJust a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\nI'm not a typical politician, that's why I got elected.\nLet's get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\nWhen I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, 'oh there's going to be trouble.' I said, 'No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.' And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don't have a war, and I have a good relationship.\nKristen, they tried to meet with him.\nThey tried to meet with him, he wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it.\nThey tried, he wouldn't do it. And that's okay. You know what, North Korea, we're not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don't understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\nAnd it didn't happen.\nExcuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\nRemember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\nFirst of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, 'Run it as well as you can' -- to my people, great people -- 'Run it as well as you can.' I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We'll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\nExcuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- 'We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.' Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, 'Oh, we're gonna have fracking.' And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\nIt's the same thing with socialized medicine.\nWhen he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he's destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n-- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\nThey say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n401k's are through the roof. 401k --\n-- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\nAnd he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\nBecause Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\nI do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\nThe bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\nFor small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\nHow are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\nSay again?\nWhat I'd really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They're all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\nChildren are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it's easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We're over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\nLet me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, 'Look at these cages, President Trump built them.' And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\nYes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\nKristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\nWho built the cages, Joe?\nLet me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\nBut just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\nHe had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\nIt's so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\nWe have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, 'Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\nYou don't know the law, Joe.\nThey don't come back.\nBut we don't have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don't have to worry about it\nGo ahead.\nYes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, 'Gee, we have to defeat him.' Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It's one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, 'What are you doing after three years?' I said, 'Why do you keep coming back?' 'Because we have no funding'. I said, 'You don't have to come back every year', 'We have to come back', because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, 'I think you need more'. And I said, 'The only bad part about this is I may never see you again', because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\nBut why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\nYou were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\nYou know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\nIf this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\nIt's the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\nYou mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\nIs this where you're going? This is where he's going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\nYou have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\nWell you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting 'Pigs in a blanket', talking about police, 'Pigs, Pigs', talking about our police, 'Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon'. I said, 'That's a horrible thing'. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\nI don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I'm the least racist person in this room.\nHe made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\nNo, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln'. I said, 'Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community'. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\nTens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what's happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what's happening out there.\nBut why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? 'That's what I'm gonna do when I become president'. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\nI just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, 'I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.' You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\nWell, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk 'em into it.\nLike I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\nSo we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can't do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\nAnd we haven't destroyed our industries.\nThey came out and said very strongly, '$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan', that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they're real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It's $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\nExcuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It's extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it's very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\nSolar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\nSo, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\nYou said it on tape.\nI'll put it on.\nExcuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. 'I am against fracking', until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\nThe families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nine times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\nWould you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\nOh, transition.\nThat's a big statement.\nThat's the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\nBecause basically what he's saying is he's going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\nIs he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\nBut that'll cost you $1 trillion.\nWe have to make our country totally successful, as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc.. But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas MIT graduates, number one in the class-- everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I'm cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody's taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401K's will go to hell and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-debate-belmont-university-nashville-tennessee-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Lesley Stahl of CBS News \"60 Minutes\"", "Date": "2020-10-26", "Text": "You're gonna be fair?\nJust be fair.\nNo, I'm not. I mean--\nI want them to be fair. You-- you don't ask Biden tough questions.\nOkay. Are you ready--\nUltimately, le-- let me-- and I-- I'll tell ya, it was happening. We created the greatest economy in the history of our country. And the other side was--\nIt is totally true.\n--a great job with COVID.\nWe have done-- that's right because we're doing so much testing.\nThere is increased testing, but according to the COVID Tracking Project, that doesn't account for all of the rise in new cases sweeping the country, or the 40% increase in hospitalizations in the past month.\nThat's right. We have turned--\n--the corner. We have turned the corner.\nWe have turned the corner.\nWe understand the disease. We understand the elderly, and we are taking care of them like nobody's ever taken care of 'em. So we are taking care of our people.\nYeah.\nPresident Trump at a rally: Suburban women will you please like me? Please, please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay?\nOh, I didn't say that. You know, that's so misleading, the way y-- I say jokingly, 'Suburban women, you should love me because I'm giving you security.' And I got rid of the worst regulation-- see, the way you said that--\n--is why people think of you and everyone else as fake news. I said kiddingly, 'Suburban women, you should love me.' I got rid of a regulation--\n--that would bring low-income housing into suburbia that is destroying-- that would destroy suburbia. And I said that in a joking way. The way you have it, it's like, 'Oh,' like I'm begging. I w-- I'm kidding. Play it, and I'm kidding. That is such a misleading question, Lesley.\nI doubt it. I doubt it. I really doubt it.\n–we're rounding the corner. We're doing well. We're doing well. We understand the disease. We've done a good job. We've done maybe a great job. What we haven't done a good job on is convincing people like you because you're really quite impossible to convince, but that's okay. And the economy now is coming back and it's coming back very strongly, and people see that, Lesley.\nWhere did I call him an idiot?\nWell, he's been wrong a lot. I like him, but he's been wrong a lot.\nI feel masks possibly work. But certainly you want to stay away a certain distance, socially distance, et cetera. But I would say a mask works. And I have nothing against masks. And I tell people to wear masks. I have no problem--\nA lotta people are wearing masks, and they're outside.\nTake a look. Yesterday we were in Arizona, record-setting rallies. Numbers of people like nobody's seen before.\n--so negative. You're so negative. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had. You just come in here with that negative attitude. These are the biggest rallies we've ever had.\nYeah.\nI am.\nLesley, we hand out thousands of masks at every rally.\n--question, Lesley? We're outside. The rallies are bigger than they've ever been. There's more enthusiasm than we've ever had. There has never been anything like what you're witnessing now, and you'll see that soon.\nYeah.\nIt will be.\nIt is developed, it is fully developed. It's going to be announced very soon--\nWhen we see what happens with Obamacare.\nWell, we're gonna have to see what happens. I think-- I hope that they end it. It'll be so good if they end it--\nNo, no. It's wrong.\nIt's wrong. A new plan will happen.\nAnd we won't do anything-- will and is. We won't do anything and no plan unless we have preexisting conditions covered.\nWith little more than a week till the election, the president has been barnstorming the swing states where the polls are tight, including Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and in Michigan.\nYeah, I think I can. People that love our country. More than anything else and they like to see our country thrive.\nI don't encourage them. They say it.\nHillary Clinton, let-- let me just tell you-- Hillary Clinton deleted, she deleted 33,000 emails after she got a subpoena from the United States Congress.\nI think it's an issue. To me it's an issue.\nExcuse me. When they say 'Lock her up,' it's not me. They say it. It starts, it-- it ends up being--\nI don't encourage it.\nNo. If I mention her name about something, they go crazy.\nIt was our Justice Department that is the one that's helping her. My Justice Department, if you call it that--\nIt was our Justice Department that's helping her. And, you know, people aren't so-- they're not liking her so much, because she's got everybody locked down.\nPresident Donald Trump at rally: You've gotta get your governor to open up your state, okay...\nI haven't gone after her.\nI haven't gone after her.\nI've helped her. It was our Justice Department--\n--that's helping her. Oh, I do criticize her, yeah.\nI think the way she locked down Michigan is a disgrace.\nThe way she closed churches in Michigan is a disgrace. I-- yeah, I think it's disgraceful what she's done. I do.\nAnd, by the way, that's other-. Of course, I don't want to lock her up. Why would I lock her up?\nLesley, it's such a vicious thing you just said. I never said, 'Lock up the governor of Michigan.' I would never say that.\nI'd like not to, but, you know, perhaps everybody has to take a little responsibility for it. But when people put out phony witch hunts, you know, when they spy on your campaign, you have to fight back. And if you don't fight back, you're not sitting here very long. You go back home.\nYou go back home to mommy.\nAs we moved from subject to subject, our conversation grew more tense. President Trump brought up what he calls the unfairness of the fake media. Most prominently: a lack of coverage of his unproven and unverified charges that former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, have received millions of dollars in corrupt payments from a Russian oligarch and a Chinese billionaire.\nI wish you would interview Joe Biden like you interview me. It would be so good. You know what?\nI don't mind it. I don't mind it. But when I watch him walk out of a store, and he's walking with an ice cream. And the question the media asks him, 'What kind of ice cream? What flavor ice cream do you have?' And he's in the midst of a scandal.\nOf course he is, Lesley.\nOf course he is.\nIt's the biggest -- second-biggest scandal. The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign. They spied on my campaign, Lesley-\nOf course there is. It's all over--\n--the place. Lesley, they--\nNo, you won't put it on because it's bad for Biden. Look, let me tell you--\n--on my campaign.\nIt's been totally verified.\nIt's been-- just go down and get the papers. They spied on my campaign, they got caught.\nAnd then they went much further than that and they got caught. And you will see that, Lesley. And you know that. But you just don't wanna put it on the air--\nOkay.\nSo why don't you get back to your interview, and let's go.\nNo, I think I wouldn't be here if I didn't have social media.\nBut the media is fake. And frankly, if I didn't have social media, I'd have no way of getting out my voice.\nYeah? Yeah?\nI don't have to discredit you.\nYou've discredited yourself.\nOf course you did.\nThey were inappropriately brought up. Right from the beginning. No, your first question was, 'This is going to be tough questions.' You don't ask Joe Biden, I saw your interview with Joe, the interview with Joe Biden.\nIt was a joke. The interview, 60 Minutes. I see Joe Biden, giving softball after softball. I've seen all of his interviews. He's never been asked a question that's hard.\nNo, but you start with me.\nExcuse me, Lesley, you started with me. Your first statement was, 'Are you ready for tough questions?'\nThat's no way to talk. That's no way to talk.\nI think we have enough of an interview here, Hope. Okay? That's enough. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go meet for two seconds, okay? Thanks. I'll see you in a little while. Thanks.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-lesley-stahl-cbs-news-60-minutes-0"}
{"Title": "Interview with Fox & Friends", "Date": "2020-11-03", "Text": "Well, thank you very much. And I hope Dan is going to be okay. Dan is a great guy. Dan is a great guy.\nHe'll be tough. He's so tough. He'll beat it.\nWell, we feel very good. We have crowds that nobody's ever had before, I can say that. I think you could agree. It's been incredible.\nThe crowds have been incredible, and nobody's ever had it before. And so, I think that translates into a lot of votes, and we're going to see very soon, but we're getting very good response. We're getting a very early response to see, and I think we're doing incredible in Florida. I think we're doing… And you were just talking about the vote, the African-American vote, et cetera. I think we're doing really well with African-American vote. I think we're doing very, very well with the Hispanic vote, and it's a great run, but it's been a great three weeks. Incredible three weeks. I think since the debate [crosstalk] the second debate was very good, and I was also interviewed by Savannah Guthrie. And that was, I think, very good. I mean, I wouldn't say she was exactly nice to me, but a lot of people watched it. A lot of people. It was a special, or I guess they would call it a town hall. It didn't feel like a town to me, but it was a very good debate or interview, I guess people say.\nBut the second debate in particular, I think was something that worked out very well. And then we did the… We got back, we're lucky we got it back, because for a period of time we did not think we were going to get these big rallies back. And we got them back and they were amazing. I mean, they were amazing. And you add it all together, and I think we really took off.\nWell, this has a special show for me. I've liked it from day one. We've had a great relationship, and then you have a great show. So it's my honor.\nWell, it's become pretty standard. We built the greatest Academy in the world. It was horribly interrupted by something that should've never happened. Came in from China, the plague, the plague from China, the horrible situation. And we had to shut it down and we had to learn about it. We had to shut it down and we did the right thing. We saved two million people. We saved a lot of people. The original model was 2.2 million people. And so if you use that model, and you go, that was a main model, you've used that model. We saved two million people, and now we're building it back up again. And we had the best economy. Nobody had ever seen anything like it. And now what happens is we build it up again and we are doing it at a record clip. You saw the 33.1 on Thursday.\nThat's the biggest number we've ever had GDP. And we're on a shape to build this up to a level that nobody's ever seen anything like it. I really think that we're going to end up with an economy that will be better than last year. Last year was at a record. Last year was the best economy we've had. So we have a chance to build something that will be fantastic. Now, in addition to that, we are doing very well. And I say rounding the corner. And some people don't like that phrase, but I use that phrase. We're coming out with vaccines, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before. We have many companies. We have the three main companies, but we have many companies coming out with them. They're going to be activated very quickly, distributed and activated very quickly. And that will be that.\nWe will tame originally, but ultimately get rid of the China plague. You see what's happening in Europe. It's a terrible thing. It's a very terrible thing. This is a horrible disease. We have learned about it. It affects the elderly. I tell the story about Barron Trump. He had it for about two seconds. It just went through him and it's gone. And the immune system on children, that's why you've got to get the children back to work, children back to school. You have to get the people, they have to go to work. We have to open up our States and that'll happen. I think now politically that will happen, because you have the date, and politically it will happen. I mean, today's going to be a very interesting day. It will be a day that, I had this once before and it worked out very well. And this day is going to be something that's going to be very important and very, very special, I think.\nSPEAKER 1: Well, Mr. President, you've got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They're crisscrossing Pennsylvania. They're going back out there. I don't know if that means they're worried. I want to get your take on that. And also, what are your plans today? Because I know you said yesterday, you said, \"We've got a lot of big surprises today.\" What are those surprises?\nSo I'm doing a big series of phone calls and to some really good people. And you're the first one, by the way, but I'm doing a big series of calls. And in doing the calls, I'm going to be talking to some people that really, that have been very important. Both to me, important, some very important calls and some people that have been very loyal to me over the years. I like those people too. Even if they reach about 15 people, that's okay with me. And I'm also going to [crosstalk]\nSPEAKER 1: You mean, media interviews?\nProbably go to Virginia. We have a headquarters over there in Virginia, just to say, thank you to all of the people. And that would be probably around 10:30 or so. I noticed that Biden went out and I think he's campaigning a little, because he's worried. We've seen tremendous swing changes. We've seen actually in the last three days, this reminds me, I hope it reminds me of four years ago. Tremendous changes have taken place over the last week. Tremendous.\nAnd what we think we're winning Texas very big. We think we're winning Florida very big. We think we're winning Arizona very big. I think we're going to do very well in North Carolina. I think we're going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We think we're doing very well everywhere. And it's more than thinking. We're seeing trends.\nAnd so you can tell this isn't just taking a poll. This is based on trends. And we think we're doing very well in States. A lot of States, really. A lot of States.\nWell, that was a weird quote, I agree with you. That was a very weird quote and I don't know what she meant, except maybe she's talking about the very strange decision made by the US Supreme Court that allows extra time and a lot of other things, frankly, but it allows extra time, and it allows for chaos, frankly. And so maybe she's talking about that. Maybe you can blow out Pennsylvania, so you don't have to [crosstalk]-\n… but I cannot imagine what that quote meant. That was a strange quote.\nNo, I think I've gotten to a point we don't get too intimidated. I have no idea who she is. She has something to do with this campaign, I guess. But no, it was a strange quote. It was not a smart quote either, I think\nWhen there's victory, if there's victory, I think we'll have victory. I think the polls are suppression balls. And I think we'll have victory, but only when there's victory. I mean there's no reason to play games. And I think we'll have victory. I look at it as being a very, a very solid chance at winning. I don't know what the chances are, I don't know how they rate the chances, but I think we have a very solid chance of winning. And I think a lot of that has to do with the tremendous crowd size for a small event. There was no small event, every place, no matter where we went were-\n… the largest… Your friend Tucker did something on his last night, I don't know if you got to see it, but he said he was looking at the internet or whatever, and he's looking at these massive crowds like he's never seen before, and in areas that were great areas, frankly, as far as I'm concerned, these are great people. These are like the heart and soul of our country.\nAnd so Tucker, he did a piece on it last night on these incredible crowds, these massive crowds. You know, it hasn't taken place ever in history, in the history of our country, what we've done in terms of crowd size and every… I really did six yesterday because the one from the day before went till two in the morning. So then I got up and did one at eight. So if I include the one that lasted until two in the morning, that was six of them. And these aren't like speeches, these are big, these are massive rallies.\nThese are really big, where you have 30, 40,000. We had a 51,000 people, and they're built in largely at airports, always open because of the corona, but they're built in airports because we have the room. And sometimes the airport wasn't big enough; it was crazy. And if that's any indication-\n… because to me, that's like the ultimate poll, that's better than somebody that said he interviewed 213 people, and then they send you a check for a million dollars, right? We don't do that. But I think it's the ultimate poll. And it's been, honestly it's been so much fun to me. There's so much love at those rallies, nobody's seen anything like it. They even say many of them, \"We love you, we love you, we love you.\" They're screaming, \"We love you,\" and I don't think it's ever happened before.\n… that chant. People liked Ronald Reagan, but that never happened to him. And the media is looking for it to have happened, because they'd like to show that I wasn't the first, but nobody's ever seen that happen. There's tremendous spirit.\n… different places. And you've seen the boats, the boats are 6,000 boats in a lake, and we're all going for records. It's been incredible, actually incredible.\nWell I was kidding actually, but there is a little emotion, but I've said that a few times, actually, I say, \"Don't make me cry, don't make me cry. You'll make me cry, and that will be very bad for my image as president,\" and I kid, so I was actually kidding. I do do-\n… a lot of times I do that, and then I take my fingers and I put them under my eye, \"Don't make me cry.\" But I do that kiddingly. But it is emotional, it's incredible. It's tremendous love. Nobody's ever seen it before; I bet you've never heard of it before. And it happens [crosstalk] at every rally.\nSPEAKER 2: And when they say they love you, I like how you say, \"Well, I love you too.\" Because when you love someone, that's always nice to hear back. But what has it been like? Have you loved the job? Has it been worth it because you've been under so much attack?\nWell, it's been mean, it's been… you've dealt with horrible people like Shifty Schiff, and Crazy Nancy, and Chuck Schumer, you deal with some horrible people.\nPeople say, \"Who is the hardest,\" friends of mine from the past really, they say, \"President,\" because they all call me president, they used to call me, \"Donald,\" now they called me, \"President,\" which is terrible. It's hard to have friends because they react differently to me now than they used to.\nYou know, in the old days, \"Hey, let's go to dinner Don.\" Now it's, \"Mr. President, gee, could we somehow get together someday?\" And I'm sad, the changes it's sort of [inaudible], but you three are friends. Okay, but it is a very different thing.\nBut you deal with people that are very deceptive, but they'll go, \"Mr. President, tell me who's the country that's most difficult to deal with? Is it Russia? Is it China? Is it North Korea? Sir, is it North Korea?\"\nAnd I go, \"No. Well, by far the most difficult country to deal with is the US, it's not even close.\"\nAnd they all say, \"You got to be kidding.\"\nAnd I say, \"No, I'm actually probably not kidding.\" We have very, very deceptive people. We have some people that I think they're sick in some ways, like an Adam Schiff, I think Adam Schiff is a sick person. And we deal with them, we just deal with them. But it's a shame, it's a shame.\nBut the inner workings of the US… very, very difficult. Unless you want to sit there and do nothing, or unless you want to exceed to doing everything they want to do. And we don't want to do that.\nWell, fortunately he's drawing flies. He's not getting anybody to go listen to him too much. Actually Fox puts him on more than anybody else, which is sort of shocking to me because Fox has changed a lot. And somebody said, \"What's the biggest difference between this and four years ago?\"\nAnd I say, \"Fox, it's much different.\" You still have great people, but you're three of them-\nBut Fox is a [crosstalk] much different place in terms of politics. Excuse me?\nWell in the old days, they wouldn't put sleepy Joe Biden on every time he opened his mouth. They had other networks for that, frankly. And it's a much different operation. I'm just telling you. It's much different. And you have great people when you have Sean and you have Laura and you have yourselves, and you have some incredible people. I'm just saying Tucker has been great. I think you really have incredible people, but it's much different. I could name some of your side players that you'll interview. You had a period of time. I think you're still doing it. But you had Democrats on more than you had Republicans. And look, it's different. I'm not complaining. I'm just telling people it's one of the biggest differences, this season compared to last. I think this season, we have much more despite that, and this is hard to believe.\nI think we've done actually much better. We obviously ran a good campaign. It was sort of a miracle campaign, but we have a record to go and we've done a lot. When you look at the tax cuts and you look at the regulation cuts, biggest in history. You look at all of the things that we've done. Space Force. We rebuilt the military. We rebuilt the entire military. It was a mess. And-\nWe just got a 91% approval rating for the vets. The vets have been really treated badly for a long period of time. And we got accountability done for the vets, which nobody thought could be done. People treat them badly. They get fired. You couldn't get people out. The vets lived in the hell. They just lived in hell and you couldn't get them out. So I mean, well, we've done so many other things. The wall is going to be completed within a very short period of time. We're over 410 miles. We're doing 10 miles a week. And it's really an incredible… It's a system exactly like border patrol wanted. It's been really amazing. And it's had a big impact, as you see.\nI mean, you announced we have the best numbers that we've ever had on the Southern border. Like right to try. We did right to try. It's not a smaller thing. It's a big thing. They've been trying to do it for many years. So if you're terminally ill and we have a great drug at the FDA but it's not going to be approved for another two years, but you're terminally ill, we now can get that drug and use it for somebody who's terminally ill. We worked a system that works out great. You sign a document to take away liability from the companies and from the country itself. And people have right to try. Instead of going all over the world or going home and dying, they can do this. They've been trying to do that for 50 years. They were never able to get it worked out. We moved the embassy, and think of it, in Israel. Every president wanted to do that.\nEvery president wanted to do that.\nJerusalem becoming the capital, they all wanted to do it. But I understand why they didn't because there was tremendous pressure once you got in not to do it from other countries, tremendous pressure like you haven't seen before. But I did it. I got it done. But we've done more than… I have a list. You could read it for a day. So we've done a lot. Very proud of it. It's great for the country.\nWell, I think it's very disrespectful to Biden, actually. I think it's a terribly disrespectful phone call to make. If you gave me that, I would have put it up on the board. We've been doing that half the last probably 15 rallies. I put up a board and we put up a lot of things. We put up how he said, \"Fracking, fracking.\" And then he said, \"No fracking.\" He came out and said, \"There will be no fracking.\" And then he went out and did the opposite once he reached Pennsylvania and learned it's a million jobs and it's tremendous money. And all of a sudden, he changes his mind. He was never hit by the press, was never asked about it. It's ridiculous. But we put things like that up on the board. Had you had this, whatever it is, Zoom, I would've put that up on the board gladly.\nThis shows tremendous disrespect for Biden. It shows exactly what I was saying that he's not going to be running the group. And that group of people is probably close to impossible to run. I call it the AOC plus three. That's a tough group to run. And they would take the country into a terrible place. But Joe's going to have a hard time. He's not going to be able to handle that. I mean, Joe is having a very hard time. Joe Biden is not prime time. And he never was actually. But he's not prime time. And he's put in a very hard position when you see all of the gaps and all of the problems. This is something that he shouldn't be… When he says he's a proud Democrat running for the US Senate.\nAnd at first I thought he was joking, but he wasn't joking. He's done that a number of times. He's called his location where he was. He's in Ohio, and he says, \"I'm in Iowa.\" It's great to be with the people of Iowa. And they start screaming, \"No, no you're in Ohio.\" And that's happened many, many times. And that's something you can't let happen. That will be the end of the speech. There's nothing you can do to recover. So, it's a tough thing for him. Frankly, he should not be in this position.\nWell, I tell you, I think it's very sad. And part of the reason is it'll all be in Democrat cities, Democrat-run cities. It's going to be in Chicago, New York and Portland and Oakland, different places, Baltimore. And that's because of weak leadership. Weak, weak leadership. And my side is a very strong side if they wanted to, but they don't like doing that. They're proud of our country. They don't want to hurt our country. But the other side is radicalized Antifa. And frankly, if you let people know that there would be hell to pay, you wouldn't have any problem, but they don't do that. They have the cops stand back, stand back-\n… do that. They have the cops stand back, stand back and watch looters walk washing machines and televisions out of stores. It's a shame to watch it. I watched what happened in Philadelphia.\nI looked at that and you see the cops standby and you know they're good cops. The Philadelphia cops are good cops. They don't want to stand back, but they're told to stand back. And these kids and wise guys and anarchists, agitators and looters and rioters, I mean, that's what they are, that when they see weakness, they go for it. It's a shame. No reason for it.\nWhen the statutes were being affected so badly, where they were knocking down statues, I took an old law… Basically, I modernized a very powerful old law, and you get 10 years in jail if you're knock down a statute. And since that time, and now this is on a federal basis, cities could do the same thing. We could reinstitute it for cities if asked. But since that time, it just stopped. I mean, it just totally stopped, because people would say, \"10 years is just too much.\" They would be able to stop this so easily by being tough, frankly, by not allowing-\n… thugs to run around and break windows.\nI think it's very sad when stores are boarded up. I understand why they do it, because a piece of last is very expensive and plywood doesn't cost much. They probably have it from years ago, from past problems. But it's a very sad… To me, it's a very sad thing.\nOur country could never be the same country if they win because they're radicalized left. Joe Biden will never call all the shots, and if he does, he's not going to be there very long. He's got a vice president who's further left than Bernie Sanders, who is not a particularly good person. And she would be, I think, a terrible first representative… If she became the first woman president, I think it would be a terrible thing for our country. I think it would be a terrible thing for women. I look forward to the first woman president, but I don't look… I wouldn't look forward to her being that person. I think it would be a very bad thing. And I think you'd have a country that would become a socialist country.\nIf they pack the court. So it will be a terrible thing, and a terrible thing. And yet, the Supreme Court has given us very bad decisions. Everyone says, \"Oh, Trump has three people.\" Now, Amy didn't take part because she just got there. I understand that. But this decision on Pennsylvania was a horrible decision. There's just no reason to go beyond a date.\nPeople should put their ballots in early. You don't have to wait until the end.\nWhy are they waiting till the end. Let the people… They have it for a long time. They put their ballots in early and there's plenty of time to count it, tabulate it and do it through a normal course. If they come late or after the fact, and then they give them all this time, so we're going to be waiting. And it's really Pennsylvania. But you could say others may be included in that. We'll have to find out.\nWe'll find out.\nBut it's a very dangerous thing to be waiting.\nAnd we're waiting this tremendous… It's not fair to the people of Pennsylvania, but it's not fair to the people of this country. And I wouldn't say they are outstanding representatives. If you look at Philadelphia, the amount of horror that's gone on there during the elections, Philadelphia has been a disaster, as far as I'm concerned. Not everybody will say it. They don't like saying it. Philadelphia will be a disaster. And it's like, we're putting these people on the honor system, but there's no reason for doing this, and it actually delays the election.\nI'd like to find out on November 3rd, the end of the evening, or late into the morning, whenever, who won the election. And that doesn't allow that to happen, unless there's a blowout or unless you don't need Pennsylvania. Now, it's very unlikely. Pennsylvania is a very important state. I think we're going to win Pennsylvania. We have very good numbers of Pennsylvania. Really good.\nBut I think we're going to win it.\nBut I think it'd be nice to have… You want to have a win on November 3rd or the morning going along beyond 12 o'clock.\nIt's a terrible thing they've done. And it's a very dangerous decision. They've been made.\nMy number last time was 306. Remember they said… You and I had this conversation a long time ago, right?\nAnd you asked me this question, believe it. I don't know. I think you remember that, but I ended up with 306. That was good numbers. 223 to 306. And that was a big number. And I think too, we will top it. I'll leave it at that. I think we'll top it. I think we'll get better.\nPeople appreciate the job we've done. And if you look at the numbers and I see the futures were up.\nI'll tell one thing, we have a headwind or the stock market, because on the chance that Biden got in, you will have a stock market go down like you wouldn't believe, if he got in. And I see the markets projected to be up quite nicely today. And it was up yesterday very nicely, because people are starting to think that I'm going to win and the stock market will go… This a real headwind having this, because it's always got, everybody has a chance, but now they're looking at it, I think, differently than they were even four days ago.\nNow, we've made a lot of progress in the last four days. And I've also worked-\n… very hard. A lot of people said, \"How do you do that?\" I said, \"I do it because I have to do it.\" But it's been an honor and has been such love. It has been, and it's love on both sides. I mean, you have 30, 40,000 more people in this big area and you feel the love. It's so incredible. And that's what I'm telling you, tucker did an unbelievable piece. He got it. He figured it out, because it's never happened before in the history of our country, never anything like this. When Biden goes and he has 20 or 30 people, that's not so different from a lot of other people. If Ronald Reagan came in to do a rally, because he was a popular guy, if he had 200 or 300 people, that's fine. That's anticipated. Usually, they'd go to a ballroom and they'd have it in a ballroom. I'm coming in and we're having 45,000 people. You had to see the rally we had the other night in Miami. Ended at 1:00 in the morning, but people didn't leave. They didn't want to leave. It's been amazing. It's truly been amazing.\nRight.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-fox-friends"}

We did what we came here to do and so much more.\nThis week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous. We extend our best wishes, and we also want them to have luck, a very important word.\nI'd like to begin by thanking just a few of the amazing people who made our remarkable journey possible. First, let me express my overwhelming gratitude for the love and support of our spectacular First Lady, Melania. Let me also share my deepest appreciation to my daughter Ivanka, my son-in-law Jared, and to Barron, Don, Eric, Tiffany, and Lara. You fill my world with light and with joy.\nI also want to thank Vice President Mike Pence, his wonderful wife Karen, and the entire Pence family. Thank you as well to my Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows; the dedicated members of the White House staff and the Cabinet; and all the incredible people across our administration who poured out their heart and soul to fight for America.\nI also want to take a moment to thank a truly exceptional group of people: the United States Secret Service. My family and I will forever be in your debt. My profound gratitude as well to everyone in the White House Military Office, the teams of Marine One and Air Force One, every member of the Armed Forces, and State and local law enforcement all across our country.\nMost of all, I want to thank the American people. To serve as your President has been an honor beyond description. Thank you for this extraordinary privilege. And that's what it is—a great privilege and a great honor.\nWe must never forget that while Americans will always have our disagreements, we are a nation of incredible, decent, faithful, and peace-loving citizens who all want our country to thrive and flourish and be very, very successful and good. We are a truly magnificent nation.\nAll Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol. Political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans. It can never be tolerated. Now more than ever, we must unify around our shared values and rise above the partisan rancor and forge our common destiny.\nFour years ago, I came to Washington as the only true outsider ever to win the Presidency. I had not spent my career as a politician, but as a builder looking at open skylines and imagining infinite possibilities. I ran for President because I knew there were towering new summits for America just waiting to be scaled. I knew the potential for our Nation was boundless as long as we put America first.\nSo I left behind my former life and stepped into a very difficult arena, but an arena nevertheless, with all sorts of potential if properly done. America had given me so much, and I wanted to give something back.\nTogether with millions of hard-working patriots across this land, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country. We also built the greatest economy in the history of the world. It was about \"America first,\" because we all wanted to make America great again. We restored the principle that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Our agenda was not about right or left, it wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation, and that means the whole Nation.\nWith the support and prayers of the American people, we achieved more than anyone thought possible. Nobody thought we could even come close.\nWe passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history. We slashed more job-killing regulations than any administration had ever done before. We fixed our broken trade deals, withdrew from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership and the impossible Paris climate accord, renegotiated the one-sided South Korea deal, and we replaced NAFTA with the groundbreaking USMCA—that's Mexico and Canada—a deal that's worked out very, very well.\nAlso, and very importantly, we imposed historic and monumental tariffs on China, made a great new deal with China. But before the ink was even dry, we and the whole world got hit with the China virus. Our trade relationship was rapidly changing, billions and billions of dollars were pouring into the U.S., but the virus forced us to go in a different direction.\nThe whole world suffered, but America outperformed other countries economically because of our incredible economy and the economy that we built. Without the foundations and footings, it wouldn't have worked out this way. We wouldn't have some of the best numbers we've ever had.\nWe also unlocked our energy resources and became the world's number-one producer of oil and natural gas by far. Powered by these policies, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We reignited America's job creation and achieved record-low unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women—almost everyone.\nIncomes soared, wages boomed, the American Dream was restored, and millions were lifted from poverty in just a few short years. It was a miracle. The stock market set one record after another—with 148 stock market highs during this short period of time—and boosted the retirements and pensions of hard-working citizens all across our Nation; 401(k)s are at a level they've never been at before. We've never seen numbers like we've seen, and that's before the pandemic and after the pandemic.\nWe rebuilt the American manufacturing base, opened up thousands of new factories, and brought back the beautiful phrase: Made in the U.S.A. To make life better for working families, we doubled the child tax credit and signed the largest ever expansion of funding for childcare and development. We joined with the private sector to secure commitments to train more than 16 million American workers for the jobs of tomorrow.\nWhen our Nation was hit with the terrible pandemic, we produced not one, but two vaccines, with record-breaking speed, and more will quickly follow. They said it couldn't be done but we did it. They call it a \"medical miracle,\" and that's what they're calling it right now, a medical miracle. Another administration would have taken 3, 4, 5, maybe even up to 10 years to develop a vaccine. We did in 9 months. We grieve for every life lost, and we pledge in their memory to wipe out this horrible pandemic once and for all.\nWhen the virus took its brutal toll on the world's economy, we launched the fastest economic recovery our country has ever seen. We passed nearly $4 trillion in economic relief, saved or supported over 50 million jobs, and slashed the unemployment rate in half. These are numbers that our country has never seen before. We created choice and transparency in health care, stood up to Big Pharma in so many ways, but especially in our effort to get favored-nations clauses added, which will give us the lowest prescription drug prices anywhere in the world.\nWe passed VA Choice, VA Accountability, \"right to try,\" and landmark criminal justice reform.\nWe confirmed three new Justices of the United States Supreme Court. We appointed nearly 300 Federal judges to interpret our Constitution as written.\nFor years, the American people pleaded with Washington to finally secure the Nation's borders. I am pleased to say we answered that plea and achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. We have given our brave border agents and heroic ICE officers the tools they need to do their jobs better than they have ever done before and to enforce our laws and keep America safe.\nWe proudly leave the next administration with the strongest and most robust border security measures ever put into place. This includes historic agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, along with more than 450 miles of powerful new wall.\nWe restored American strength at home and American leadership abroad. The world respects us again. Please don't lose that respect. We reclaimed our sovereignty by standing up for America at the United Nations and withdrawing from the one-sided global deals that never served our interests. And NATO countries are now paying hundreds of billions of dollars more than when I arrived just a few years ago. It was very unfair. We were paying the cost for the world. Now the world is helping us.\nAnd perhaps most importantly of all, with nearly $3 trillion, we fully rebuilt the American military, all made in the U.S.A. We launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in 75 years: the Space Force. And last spring, I stood at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and watched as American astronauts returned to space on American rockets for the first time in many, many years.\nWe revitalized our alliances and rallied the nations of the world to stand up to China like never before. We obliterated the ISIS caliphate and ended the wretched life of its founder and leader, al-Baghdadi. We stood up to the oppressive Iranian regime and killed the world's top terrorist, Iranian butcher Qasem Soleimani. We recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\nAs a result of our bold diplomacy and principled realism, we achieved a series of historic peace deals in the Middle East. Nobody believed it could happen. The Abraham Accords opened the doors to a future of peace and harmony, not violence and bloodshed. It is the dawn of a new Middle East, and we are bringing our soldiers home.\nI am especially proud to be the first President in decades who has started no new wars.\nAbove all, we have reasserted the sacred idea that, in America, the Government answers to the people. Our guiding light, our north star, our unwavering conviction has been that we are here to serve the noble everyday citizens of America. Our allegiance is not to the special interests, corporations, or global entities, it's to our children, our citizens, and to our Nation itself.\nAs President, my top priority, my constant concern, has always been the best interests of American workers and American families. I did not seek the easiest course; by far, it was actually the most difficult. I did not seek the path that would get the least criticism. I took on the tough battles, the hardest fights, the most difficult choices, because that's what you elected me to do. Your needs were my first and last unyielding focus. This, I hope, will be our greatest legacy: Together, we put the American people back in charge of our country. We restored self-government. We restored the idea that in America no one is forgotten, because everyone matters and everyone has a voice. We fought for the principle that every citizen is entitled to equal dignity, equal treatment, and equal rights, because we are all made equal by God. Everyone is entitled to be treated with respect, to have their voice heard, and to have their government listen. You are loyal to your country, and my administration was always loyal to you.\nWe worked to build a country in which every citizen could find a great job and support their wonderful families. We fought for the communities where every American could be safe and schools where every child could learn. We promoted a culture where our laws would be upheld, our heroes honored, our history preserved, and law-abiding citizens are never taken for granted. Americans should take tremendous satisfaction in all that we have achieved together. It's incredible.\nNow, as I leave the White House, I have been reflecting on the dangers that threaten the priceless inheritance we all share. As the world's most powerful nation, America faces constant threats and challenges from abroad. But the greatest danger we face is a loss of confidence in ourselves, a loss of confidence in our national greatness. A nation is only as strong as its spirit. We are only as dynamic as our pride. We are only as vibrant as the faith that beats in the hearts of our people.\nNo nation can long thrive that loses faith in its own values, history, and heroes, for these are the very sources of our unity and our vitality. What has always allowed America to prevail and triumph over the great challenges of the past has been an unyielding and unashamed conviction in the nobility of our country and its unique purpose in history. We must never lose this conviction. We must never forsake our belief in America.\nThe key to national greatness lies in sustaining and instilling our shared national identity. That means focusing on what we have in common: the heritage that we all share.\nAt the center of this heritage is also a robust belief in free expression, free speech, and open debate. Only if we forget who we are, and how we got here, could we ever allow political censorship and blacklisting to take place in America. It's not even thinkable. Shutting down free and open debate violates our core values and most enduring traditions.\nIn America, we don't insist on absolute conformity or enforce rigid orthodoxies and punitive speech codes. We just don't do that. America is not a timid nation of tame souls who need to be sheltered and protected from those with whom we disagree. That's not who we are. It will never be who we are.\nFor nearly 250 years, in the face of every challenge, Americans have always summoned our unmatched courage, confidence, and fierce independence. These are the miraculous traits that once led millions of everyday citizens to set out across a wild continent and carve out a new life in the great West. It was the same profound love of our God-given freedom that willed our soldiers into battle and our astronauts into space.\nAs I think back on the past 4 years, one image rises in my mind above all others. Whenever I traveled all along the motorcade route, there were thousands and thousands of people. They came out with their families so that they could stand as we passed and proudly wave our great American flag. It never failed to deeply move me. I knew that they did not just come out to show their support of me, they came out to show me their support and love for our country. This is a republic of proud citizens who are united by our common conviction that America is the greatest nation in all of history. We are, and must always be, a land of hope, of light, and of glory to all the world. This is the precious inheritance that we must safeguard at every single turn.\nFor the past 4 years, I have worked to do just that. From a great hall of Muslim leaders in Riyadh to a great square of Polish people in Warsaw; from the floor of the Korean Assembly to the podium at the United Nations General Assembly; and from the Forbidden City in Beijing to the shadow of Mount Rushmore, I fought for you, I fought for your family, I fought for our country. Above all, I fought for America and all it stands for, and that is safe, strong, proud, and free.\nNow, as I prepare to hand power over to a new administration at noon on Wednesday, I want you to know that the movement we started is only just beginning. There's never been anything like it. The belief that a nation must serve its citizens will not dwindle but instead only grow stronger by the day.\nAs long as the American people hold in their hearts deep and devoted love of country, then there is nothing that this nation cannot achieve. Our communities will flourish. Our people will be prosperous. Our traditions will be cherished. Our faith will be strong. And our future will be brighter than ever before.\nI go from this majestic place with a loyal and joyful heart, an optimistic spirit, and a supreme confidence that for our country and for our children, the best is yet to come.\nThank you, and farewell. God bless you. God bless the United States of America.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/farewell-address-the-nation-3"}
{"Title": "Donald Trump Interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News", "Date": "2021-08-17", "Text": "Well, it's good to be with you, HANNITY, but it's a terrible time for our country. I don't think, in all of the years, our country has ever been so humiliated. I don't know. Would you call it a military defeat or a psychological defeat? There's never been anything like what's happened here.\nYou can go back to Jimmy Carter with the hostages. We all thought that was a great embarrassment. And we were pulled out of that by Ronald Reagan. This is many, many times worse. And you're dealing with thousands and thousands of Americans and others that are stranded and very dangerously really stranded in Afghanistan. So, it's something that you can't even believe that a thing like this could…\nI looked at that big monster cargo plane yesterday with people grabbing the side and trying to get flown out of Afghanistan because of their fear, their incredible fear. And they're blowing off the plane from 2,000 feet up in the air. Nobody's ever seen anything like that. That blows the helicopters in Vietnam away. That's not even a contest. This has been the most humiliating period of time I have ever seen.\nYeah, we had a great deal. We worked on it very hard. Mike Pompeo, a brilliant guy, and many others worked on it endlessly, meetings with the Taliban. Of course, you have to meet with the Taliban. They're the ones that you're negotiating with. I spoke on numerous occasions to the head of the Taliban and we had a very strong conversation. I told him up front, I said: \"Look, before we start, let me just tell you right now that if anything bad happens to Americans or anybody else, or if you ever come over to our land, we will hit you with a force that no country has ever been hit with before, a force so great that you won't even believe it. And your village, and we know where it is…\" and I named it, \"will be the first one.\"\n\"The first bombs will be dropped right there.\"\nYeah.\nTo Mullah Baradar, who is probably the top person now. Nobody really knows who the top person is, but I would say that's probably the top person. And it seems to be that's the way it's rolling right now, but I had a very strong conversation. I also had a good conversation with him. We talked for a while after that. That was the primary point I was making and he understood it.\nAnd I asked him, \"Do you understand?\"\nHe said, \"Yes, I do understand.\"\nAnd I wanted them to get a deal done with the Afghan government. Now, I never had a lot of confidence, frankly, in Ghani. I said that openly and plainly. I thought he was a total crook. I thought he got away with murder. He spent all his time wining and dining our senators. And the senators were in his pocket. That was one of the problems that we had. But I never liked him. And I guess, based on his escape with cash… I don't know, maybe that's a true story. I would suspect it is. All you have to do is look at his lifestyle, study his houses where he lives. He got away with murder in many different ways.\nBut I had a very, very strong talk with the Taliban, which I considered to be much more important in this sense, because they were the problem. And they have been there for a long time. And they're good fighters and they fight hard. And after I said that, we had a pretty good conversation.\nNow, I have to tell you that, if you remember, when they were coming to Washington to meet with me, they decided to kill an American soldier, because they thought that was a good way to negotiate. And I canceled the trip. And we had a conditions-based agreement. And if you remember, it said May 1, we want to get out, because we have to get out.\nI have listened to people on your show and other shows say we should stay. They don't know. We were spending $42 billion a year, $42 billion. Think of it, $42 billion. I understand Russia spends $50 billion a year for their entire military. We were spending $42 billion, not 1%. They were saying 1%. That's a lot of nonsense. We're spending $42 billion a year on defending this for years and years. We're in there really now, not 20 years, but 21-and-a-half years. And we get nothing out of any of these things that we do, whether it's them or many other countries I could tell you about. I'm not going to insult anybody right now. But to spend that kind of money, and then to have people get on shows and say how inexpensive it was…\nAnd I have to tell you also that we lost no soldiers in the last year-and-a-half because of me and because of the understanding that we had. We lost no… Think of that. In Chicago and in New York and in other cities in the United States, many people die every weekend. We lost no soldiers in Afghanistan because they knew I wasn't going to put up with it. And that's what happened. So, we had a very strong conversation.\nWell, we did. We got rid of the caliphate. Everyone said it was impossible, and I did it very quickly. And I let the generals make the decisions, the generals, the real generals, the ones that were over there doing the fighting, the ones that knew how to do it, because we have a lot of generals that shouldn't be generals right now, frankly. And I'm watching them all the time. But we have some great ones. We have great leaders in our military. We have the greatest military in the world and we're giving it a very bad reputation, what's happening.\nThink of it. We took this horrible place, I mean, a place that just we shouldn't have been in involved. It was a horrible decision going into the Middle East. And I know the Bush family will not be happy, but I believe it was the worst decision in the history of our country when we decided to go into the Middle East. It's turned out to be quicksand. We have destroyed the Middle East. Do you think it's better now than it was 20, 21 years ago? It's much worse. It was a horrible decision, cost us trillions of dollars and, if you look at both sides, because I like to look at both sides, millions and millions of lives. And it's no different than it was. It's much worse, because you have to rebuild it. It has been blown to pieces. The worst decision ever made was going. You could do a strike as retribution, and it could be a big strike, as retribution for the World Trade Center, et cetera, but to get stuck in there, it was like quicksand. So, we did a terrible thing.\nBut think of what's happening now. I have heard as many as 40,000 Americans. And the Taliban, good fighters, I will tell you, they're good fighters. We have to give them credit for that. They have been fighting for 1,000 years. That's what they do, is they fight. The Taliban has circled the airport. And who knows if they're going to treat us right. You know, all of a sudden, they will say, \"Well…\" Frankly, if they were smart, then really… And they are smart, and they are smart. They should let the Americans out. But we have had situations where you have two or three or four hostages. We could have 40,000 Americans, not to mention others, like people that helped us in Afghanistan.\nSo, we have never had a situation like this. We have 40,000 potential hostages, a minimum-\n… of 11,000, but it could be as many as 40.\nNo, they have no idea how many. Nobody knows how many. They don't know anything.\nWe would have hit them very hard. Again, the words are conditions, plural, conditions-based. It was an agreement where, actually, we wanted to get out by May 1, and they violated the agreement. So, we didn't. It's a great agreement from a lot of different standpoints. And, frankly, Biden didn't have to even go by that agreement. He could have done… Look what he's done to the border. We had the greatest border, Southern border, in the history of our country. We stopped drugs. We stopped human trafficking. We stopped people from coming in, prisoners from coming in. Now-\nWe stopped people from coming in, prisoners from coming in. Now you have the worst people in the world. They're emptying their jails into our country. This is like the Southern border but it's handled even worse. Nobody handled the Southern border worse than him. We had the most secure border we've ever had. Now we have, by far, the worst border we've ever had.\nWell, Afghanistan is the exact same thing. To think of this, we have a military, it's holding it. I got to reduce down to 2,500 soldiers and they were doing a good job. It was fine. It was a smaller force. I took it down from close to 20 to 2,500 and we were fine, but we have the military there and we take the military out before we took our civilians out and before we took the interpreters and other, we want to try and help.\nBut by the way, I'm America first, okay? The Americans come out first, but we're also going to help people that helped us. And we have to be very careful with the vetting because you have some rough people in there, but we're going to help those people, but can you imagine?\nNow what we were going to do just very quickly is we were going to take the military out last, okay? Last. The people were coming out. They were going to come out, but the agreement was violated, so I held things back because we weren't going to do anything again, conditions based.\nSo they weren't fulfilling their obligations and condition, but here's… Just to finish. The people come out first, then I was going to take all of the military equipment. We have billions and billions of dollars worth of new Black Hawk helicopters, brand new that Russia now will be examining and so will China and so will everybody else to figure it, because it's the greatest in the world.\nWe have brand new army tanks and all sorts of equipment, missiles. We have everything. I was going to take it out because I knew they weren't going to fight. Just one thing, and I have to say, and this is different from everyone else. I said, \"Why are they fighting? Why are these Afghan soldiers fighting against the Taliban?\" And I was told some very bad information by a lot of different people.\nThe fact is they're among the highest paid soldiers in the world. They were doing it for a paycheck because once we stopped, once we left, they stopped fighting. So all of the people that talk about the bravery and everything, I say everybody's brave. But the fact is our country was paying the Afghan soldiers a fortune.\nSo we were sort of bribing them to fight. And that's not what it's all about. It's a great thing that we're getting out, but nobody has ever handled a withdrawal worse than Joe Biden. This is the greatest embarrassment, I believe, in the history of our country.\nAnd he only returned because he was getting terrible press, okay? He didn't return for any other reason. And I don't even believe he's calling the shots. Look, what you need more than anything is a president that's respected. You need a president that got rid of ISIS. We 100% got rid of ISIS. We did a job, Al Baghdadi. I won't even mention all of the things that we did. Nobody's ever done what we've done.\nWe were respected all over the world. China was paying us billions and billions of dollars of tariffs. Companies were moving back into our country and China respected us. And frankly, they respected me. But you look, Russia, I had the pipeline stopped. Totally stopped. Biden comes in. He approves that pipeline, but he disapproves the Keystone XL Pipeline.\nYou need a president that's respected. I've never realized how important frankly, and it's a horrible thing to say, how important a president, the head of this country is? I thought it would maybe run through bureaucracy. It doesn't. You need somebody up there that they're going to respect. So when they say, \"Oh, he talked to the Taliban, you remember they were criticizing me.\"\nThey criticized me when I talked to Kim Jong-un. Well, President Biden told me it's the single biggest problem we have. I said, \"Have you ever called him? Have you ever talked to him?\" \"No, I haven't.\" He did try but he was not receptive on the other side, but he was receptive with me.\nNow we were supposed to have a war and probably a very big nuclear war. I get along with him great and I got along with him great. He doesn't like Biden much, I'll tell you that. But I got along with him great and we had no problems. You remember that? We were virtual-\nRemember the big button versus the little button and all thing. Let me just… We get along great. We had a very good relationship. We met, we got no credit for that one. No problem. By the way, South Korea, I got them to pay billions of dollars. Billions. We're protecting South Korea. They're very wealthy. They build the ships. They build the televisions. They've built… They do everything. They're very rich.\nThey were paying us nothing. I got them to pay billions and billions of dollars because we're protecting them from North Korea. And I had a very good relationship with President Moon and all of the people in South Korea. In fact, they liked me and I liked them, but I said, \"Why are we doing this for nothing?\"\nJapan, the same thing. So many… We're protecting the world. We can't do this. We're not supposed to be doing this. If you look at Russia, if you look at China, how many countries are they fighting for? One, you ask them. They're fighting for Russia, they're fighting for China. They're not fighting for 93 different countries all over the world. Most of them, I mean, nobody ever heard of them. So we had a very, very strong conversation with the Mullah. And frankly, it absolutely is interesting.\nThey would not have done what they've done right now. This is the greatest embarrassment and beyond embarrassment. This is something that will affect our relationships for years to come and decades to come. I will say when China watches this, they're so happy and they're laughing at us. They're laughing. I extracted billions and billions of dollars out of China. It never happened.\nWe never got 10 cents from China. Billions and billions. They was so happy to see a rigged election. They might've helped it along actually, but they were so happy. But Sean, I'll tell you what, this is the greatest embarrassment that I've ever seen. This is… And you know it better than… You do an incredible job in covering it and I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it.\nThis is the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country. There's never been… And let me tell you, we haven't stopped. This is not ending again. We have all of those thousands of Americans over there and others, and you're saying, \" How are they going to get…\" They have a Taliban ring around the airport and they said, \"Nobody else now.\"\nThey're saying we'll negotiate. But I really… Do you really think… I mean, their history is that they're very brutal and they don't like to negotiate. That's their history and Biden put us in this position. He should have gotten the civilians out first. Then he should have taken the military equipment.\nWe have billions of dollars of brand new, beautiful equipment. Take the equipment out and then take the soldiers out. And frankly, I said, take the soldiers out. But before you leave, blow up all the forts because we built these forts that are being now used by the enemy. It's not even believable.\nWell, I had a great relationship with President Xi, a really great relationship. We got along great until COVID, even though I taxed the hell out of him through the tariffs, they weren't happy. But I had a very good relationship and we met at-\nThey weren't happy, but I had a very good relationship, and we met at Mar-a-Lago, and I told him very strongly, \"Do not do anything having to do with Taiwan. Just don't do it.\" And I said it much stronger than that. I'm not going to say exactly how, but it was said very strongly. This wasn't a call, this was sitting in a sofa at Mar-a-Lago, where a meeting that was supposed to last 15 minutes before we went on to various other things with our different people, but it lasted for hours. We got along great.\nThe first half hour, I said, \"Do not do anything having to do with Taiwan. I know you want to, do not do it.\" Anyway, then the election gets rigged and we end up with a different president. And what happens, there are bombers now last week, 28 bombers flying over Taiwan. And this happened a week after the election. They were all of a sudden, I think bad things are going to happen with respect to Taiwan because they don't respect our leadership and they no longer respect our country. And that's a really bad thing, China does not respect us any longer. And they had more respect for us just seven months ago than they ever had for this country.\nI've never seen anything like what was happening and what is happening now at our Southern border, all he had to do is nothing. We had the greatest Remain in Mexico, people weren't even allowed into our country. And we won that in the courts, it was very tough. The wall was almost completed. It could have been built in another month, they delayed with two and a half years, when the Democrats in Congress sued me. We never had a border anywhere like it.\nAnd then almost immediately they ended these policies, Catch and Release, you catch them and release them into our country, instead of catching them and bringing them back to their country. And many of these people are stone cold and very hard convicts and prisoners, they're very tough. I mean, literally, as I said, they are emptying their jails. And not just the three countries, not just Honduras, and Guatemala, and El Salvador, many countries are coming in and they're emptying out their prisons and letting them come into our country. And they're walking in in caravans and other ways. What's happening?\nSo I never saw anything so stupid in my life until the last few days with Afghanistan, that blows the stupidity of the Southern border. What happened and what is happening in Afghanistan is unbelievable. And we're being set up by very tough people that are very great negotiators. I'll tell you what, they're automatically great negotiators. They've been fighting for a thousand years, and everything about them, they negotiate. We're being set up. They have all of those people, and in a certain way, I guarantee you, they consider them to be hostages. And let's see what happens over the coming weeks. But this is not a story that just ended today or yesterday, this is a story that's going to go on for a long time, and it could be a very, very bad ending.\nZero.\nSo energy independence was one of my greatest achievements, I thought. I think the vaccine, energy independence, what we did on the border, frankly, Afghanistan would have been great, we would have been out, and we would have been out with dignity and with pride and it would have worked out great, none of this stuff going, this though. Again, it's not the concept of leaving, it's the way they withdrew, it was not even possible to believe. But gasoline, as you know, was a $1.87 when I was leaving office, and now it's going to be up to over $5 very soon. And they're talking to OPEC. I know the OPEC people very well. You talk about negotiators, they're killing us. And what you didn't say is that Biden failed with OPEC. They told him no on the cutbacks, they failed with OPEC.\nTo think that we're back to negotiating with OPEC, that's how we got into the Middle East years ago because we needed the energy, and we went into the Middle East and would protect countries because we needed the energy. We didn't have to do that anymore, we were energy independent. And now, those wells are shut down and those jobs are gone. And Keystone is, and it's number is 48,000 jobs not 8,000 jobs. And they lied in the campaign because Biden never talked about closing up Keystone. He said, \"Oh, well, we'll look at it. We'll look at it.\" They were lying because it was almost the first day that they closed up Keystone and those workers are devastated. And the head of the union, they all support me, but the head of the union supported Biden and they got to throw him the hell out because he was worthless because look what happened. But they lied about so many things. They lied about energy, they lied about Keystone, they lied about the military, they lied about so much. Our country is in such trouble, such trouble.\nSo this story, the new tape that just came out two days ago has not been on any mainstream media at all. It was on your show and a couple of shows, but no mainstream, it wasn't an NBC, or CBS, or ABC, it wasn't on CNN, it wasn't on any, it's Hunter Biden, and it's the worst thing I've seen. You can't even imagine this. And look, I hope families live well, but what they're doing is they're doing political persecutions with their prosecutors, whether they're local or federal and our people didn't do that, the Republicans don't do it anywhere. I mean, it's like a different world. They use prosecutors for persecution, and it's happening. And our country is angry about it and they see it. But what's going on with Hunter and China and Russia and all of that. I mean, they go after people for much, for tiny…\nYeah. And all of that. They go after people for tiny little things. And here's somebody that took vast amounts of money out of China and out of Ukraine and out of Russia, three and a half million dollars from the mayor's wife and Chris Wallace. Wouldn't let me talk about that during a debate. He wouldn't even let me bring it up. Well, that has nothing to do. I said, \"It has a lot to do with it.\"\nBut it's a very sad period of time for our country. Everything's going bad. We have inflation. The economy is going to go to hell. We have inflation like we haven't seen in a long time. I think it's much worse if you look just at energy. And when energy goes up, everything goes up because it's all about energy. Everything goes up. But you look at the price of food where it's being doubled and tripled in some cases, we're going to have inflation.\nAnd I remember with Jimmy Carter … and the good thing is for Jimmy is that Jimmy's looking like a much better president right now because you always have to have comparisons. But I remember with Jimmy Carter with a big inflation, the prime rate went to 21%, 21% and the country came to a halt. Worse than a halt. Well, I'll tell you, we better get our act together. That's all I can say.\nYou look at what's going on with our economy and with inflation and so many other things. ANWR in Alaska, biggest drilling site in the world, I got it open. Ronald Reagan couldn't do it. Nobody could do it for 60, 7 … They'd been trying for 60, 70 years, I got it done. And it was just terminated. The biggest site in the world, probably bigger than Saudi Arabia in terms of oil. I got it done and they just terminated it. And the people of Alaska are very upset. Okay. They are very upset with Senator Murkowski and others.\nBut here's the greatest thing. And they ended it. So we had energy independence and now we don't.\nThey could all be done. Yeah. Well, nothing's simple. The things we want on the border were won through courts. It took a long time. And then all of a sudden they gave them up. We had to make deals with Mexico. The President of Mexico is a great guy. We're very friendly and we did a deal. I had 28,000 soldiers paid for by Mexico, his soldiers on the border, not letting people in, and we didn't pay anything. I promised not to tariff his cars during this period, but that's okay, whatever it takes. But we didn't have people coming in during the construction of the wall. And the wall worked. We built almost 500 miles. They could finish it in a month. Now they're paying billions of dollars not to finish the wall. It's not even believable. And the contractors that haven't been … They're just having a field day. But when you look at all of this stupidity, I don't think our country can take it. And I don't think our people can take it, either.\nYeah. First of all, the border, it's not 25 years, it's the worst in history. It's not the worst in 25 years. We've never had a situation where massive caravans of people are pouring into our country. So it's the worst ever.\nAs far as the vaccine, I'm very proud of it. I pushed the FDA like they've never been pushed. They don't like me too much. I'm not so sure I like them. Very bureaucratic, but I got them to approve a great vaccine, three of them, in a period of less than nine months. I was told by Fauci and everybody else it would take three to five years and probably five and it probably won't even happen. And I got it done in less than nine months. So I consider it a great achievement. I actually think that if we didn't get it done, worldwide, you would have another Spanish flu, which killed almost a hundred million people according to history. 50 to a hundred, they don't even know. But I would love people to take the vaccine. In the meantime, wear your mask if you want but, again, you want your freedoms. You have to have your freedoms.\nSo, because the campaign finance laws are extremely complicated and unbelievably stupid, I'm actually not allowed to answer that question. Can you believe it? I'd love to answer it. But let me put it this way. I think you'll be happy. And I think a lot of our friends will be very happy, but I'm not actually allowed to answer it. It makes it very difficult if I do. So people, you're going to be happy because I love this country and I hate to see what's happening to it. As far as if you look at-\nWell, I would, but they're not into words, they're into strength. And the strength is the President because he controls … I rebuilt the military. We had an obsolete military. We had old jets, we had 45-year-old jets. We rebuilt this military and created Space Force. But the answer is I'd like to help, but you have to do it through the strength of the President's office and Biden has dissipated that strength. We are no longer respected.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/donald-trump-interview-with-sean-hannity-fox-news"}
{"Title": "Donald Trump Interview with Greg Gutfeld of Fox News", "Date": "2021-09-09", "Text": "Well, first of all, I say, why is she not doing it? Does she have some kind of religious thing?\nSkeptical.\nWell, she's Russian.\nThat's the end of that.\nNo. Very smart and very hard-headed. I think I know your wife a little bit, right?\nBut she's great. And let her do what she wants to do. I got vaccinated and I feel very good. I think we saved millions and millions of people worldwide. In 1917 they say approximately a hundred million people died. I think we could have been into that situation because it was very bad. And now if you're vaccinated, the other thing that shows that if you do get sick, you don't get sick like they were before, meaning you don't die.\nSo I would recommend, but I also say that, let her have her freedom. [inaudible] freedom, right?\nShe needs freedom.\nI probably have to agree with that.\nWell, I had two forms of presidency. Number one, I had to run the country, work on the world and do things, and the other thing I had to survive. The survival was much tougher because I had fake Mueller people coming after me. I had 19 really haters after me. I had every form of law enforcement after me. It started from the day I came down the escalator. It never stops. I have every prosecutor after me. They're looking at deals that I did years and years ago, I forgot about them. It is a disgrace. So I had to survive, number one. And number two, really, I guess I'd put it in a different order, but if you don't survive, you can't do a good job in terms of running. So I had survival and I had running the country.\nAnd I would say the survival was actually much tougher. Somebody said, \"What was the toughest, president?\" A friend of mine. Very successful guy, used to call me Don, Donny, Donald. Now he said … You lose all your friends because you're president. They're all afraid to talk to you. \"Mr. President, could I ask you one question? Who was the toughest to deal with it? Was it China? Could it be Putin in Russia? What about North Korea? Kim Jong-un?\" I said, \"Well, the toughest actually was the United States. Dealing with these maniacs that we have over here with Pelosi and Schumer and all of them. That was probably the toughest. Far tougher than a lot of world leaders.\" And isn't that a shame when you think about it? Isn't it a shame?\nBut you also gained friends.\nSure. Right. Trump-\nThey call them a lot of things, but derangement syndrome seems … and there is something like that. It's crazy. And why would they do that? We rebuilt the military. We took care of everything. We came up, whether you say vaccines are helping people medically, right to try, where they were able to try somebody dying. And we have drugs that might work and you couldn't use them.\nTaxes, by the way. Regulations, the largest tax cut in history, largest regulation cut by far in history, in all records.\nIt must be my personality. We did a great job. I rebuilt the military, all that beautiful stuff, that brand new stuff and you know who has it now? The Taliban.\nI built it for the Taliban.\nIt wasn't supposed to happen. Now we see these beautiful, perfect brand new rifles, and these guys are carrying two. And they're wearing our uniforms and they're flying our helicopters, and it's a disgrace.\nWell, it is Christmas.\nThey're still celebrating. Okay. So I told you about Abdul, funny stuff. And when I first spoke to him by phone, I said, \"Nice to speak to you by phone, Abdul.\" And he goes, \"Ah.\" They're ferocious people. You go to Broadway shows, they fight. They like to fight. They've been fighting for about a thousand years. How we-\nBy the way I say … You do? I like it actually. It's very interesting, and I've been saying it for a long time. Our country, the worst decision ever made was going into the quicksand, which is called the Middle East. $2 trillion and millions of lives, because I like to count both sides, okay? Millions of lives and the place has been obliterated. And it's more dangerous now, if you think about it. I had them in check. I wiped out ISIS, you know who I took out. I took out the leaders, the biggest people, bigger than anybody. Nobody even believes what I did. And in a few months, it can all be dissipated.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/donald-trump-interview-with-greg-gutfeld-fox-news"}
{"Title": "Donald Trump Interview with Judge Jeanine Pirro of Fox News", "Date": "2021-10-30", "Text": "Thank you.\nWell, it's probably the worst presidency in history. I can't imagine. I used to say Jimmy Carter, not a big fan of Bush getting us into the Middle East, to be honest with you. I think this is though, the worst in the history of our country. If you look at Afghanistan and that horrible thing that happened to our nation with these young people being killed, and by the way, so badly injured. We have over 20, no arms, no legs, nobody ever talks about them. And then to leave $85 billion worth of the best military equipment, brand new, much of it brand new, better than what we have, right out of the box. And they didn't explode it, they didn't blow it up like they said. They did a couple of old planes that were not very valuable. No, I think that was the worst. And I'll tell you what, it's getting to be pretty close. What's happening on the border is one of the great embarrassments for our country also.\nI think you have to say an F. And not an F plus it would be an F. It's a failed administration. It's a disaster. I've never seen anything like it. And by the way, I wish he'd do well. I love the country more than I love anything, family, God, country, we have to take care of our country. I would love to see him do well. I don't think there's ever been a greater embarrassment as an administration. And we had everything ready to go, we handed it on a plate. Whether it was the border or Afghanistan, we were getting out, but we were going to get out with great dignity and strength.\nWell, his own Secretary of State, Gates said very strongly, he never made a correct decision in his life. Now that was made-\nNumerous times by numerous people. But it was made even recently by Gates and others that worked with him. And I think Afghanistan was a disaster. Not getting out, I was the one that set it up. I brought it down to 2,500 soldiers and we were in great shape and they weren't going to touch us, they knew. They weren't going to touch us. And then he took out the military before he took out the people. He left maybe thousands of people that are Americans and people that should be taken out.\nWell, I think the military is largely discredited. I think our top people in the military discredited, he might see that, if he understands it, he might see that. I wanted to get out also. I remember Milley telling me, because I said, \"I want every screw, every bolt, every nut, every tank. I want to take the tents, the big tents that hold the equipment and the planes. I want everything out.\" Getting the planes out, you just fly him into Pakistan and then take them over to our country. So easy.\nThey left everything. But I remember Milley saying, and he told me this, and I lost a lot of respect when he said it. \"Sir, we'll save money if we leave the equipment.\" I said, \"Save money? If we leave a $50 million airplane or a $10 million tank, you think we're saving money by not putting it into a plane or flying it out?\" I said, \"What does that mean?\" \"Sir, it's cheaper to leave it than it is to take them.\" And I said, \"That's a fool talking.\" When Milley said that I lost such respect for him. I said, \"Give it to me again. Tell me again. I want to hear it one more time.\" And he said that. I really lost a lot of respect for him.\nI've been watching the school board hearings more closely than I ever have, to be honest, and it's so interesting. The parents are incensed. They're not terrorists, they're just people that are so upset. They're angry, they're hurt, they're crying because their children are being taught things that in our opinion, in my opinion, and a vast majority of the people in this country's opinion, they don't want their children to hear about this stuff. They want to go back to reading, writing, and arithmetic. And they want to hear that black people are good and they want to hear that white people are good. This is the division that's being caused by these programs are just terrible.\nWell, I think he's going to do very well. Look, McAuliffe made a tremendous mistake, but it's really, probably not a mistake from his standpoint, he believes it. He said the parents have nothing to do with what their children are going to learn. They have nothing to do with it. I heard that statement. I said, \"Is that going to be bad? Is that going to be like deplorables?\" Remember when Hillary made the statement deplorables? I said, \"That's not a nice word.\" And it blew up. I think this is going to cause him tremendous problems come Tuesday.\nI think he's a good man, and I think he's a successful man. He loves Virginia, he loves the country.\nI think he should win. He should win. I'll be honest, my base has to turn out. If my base turns out, he's going to win. And I hope they turn out, I really want them to turn out.\nWell, I think it backfires because I think that gets the base to come out and vote by doing that, by hooking me with him as much. And I know him a little bit, but I really know him as a good person. The last person that ran as a Republican did not embrace Trump in Virginia. He got killed. He was just absolutely destroyed. And I think if my base doesn't come out, he can't win. I think my base has to come out very strongly.\nWell, something has happened and this is not from an egotistical standpoint. It's a great honor, because it's never happened before to anybody. If I endorse somebody, they win. If I endorse somebody, they win. I think I'm 148 and two. That's a pretty good number.\nAnd I did endorse Youngkin, And we're going to see. I hope it's not going to be three. Do you understand that? I did. I endorsed him strongly. He's a good man. He wants to do the right job. He's a sane person. These people are insane.\nIt's terrible.\nIncredible.\nNo it's he doesn't have any idea. Look, one of the things I was most proud about our country became energy independent. We didn't need the Middle East, we didn't need Russia, we didn't need anybody. We had more than them. We were number one by far over Saudi Arabia, and you know this, and Russia. Number one by far. I had the pipelines going, Keystone XL pipeline. Amazingly, I ended the Russian pipeline. I was not good to Russia, I got along well with Russia, I got along well with Putin, but they weren't happy with Trump, I can tell you that. But Biden opened up this big massive pipeline all over Europe, but he closed down the XL. And I don't have to say it, because you heard it a thousand times. More importantly, we're energy independent no longer. I was so proud of that. First time, really in history. They say 75 years, but I don't believe we were ever energy independent.\nWe were energy independent. We were doing so much, the prices, it was $1.87 a gallon if look at the numbers.\nAnd now yesterday they had in a certain section of California, $7.70. It's always the lead, it's going to follow, and it's going to go a lot higher than that. And Biden sent people to go see Russia, Saudi Arabia, and other members of OPEC that we need help because we don't have enough. Now, when you talk about inflation, the biggest factor in my opinion is no energy. The trucks, the factories, everything, the deliveries, the planes, everything, it's so energy based that the energy now is so expensive to get. We don't have enough oil. I filled up the strategic reserves for almost nothing. When oil hit bottom, we were almost empty with the reserves and nobody thought of it.\nI said, \"This would be a great time to fill up. We'll buy it cheap.\" I never got credit. I don't think anybody's ever mentioned it. But I bought 75 million barrels, I believe it was. 75 million barrels, which is a massive order. It was good for two things. The prices got so low that it was hurting our energy jobs. And we bought it cheap as hell, and now he wants to use that energy, that oil that I bought at a great price, that should be used in cases of a emergency, he wants to now drain it so that the prices come down.\nIt's not 18 cents. No, I could get that down within six months. I'll bet you, I could get it down to $2, $2.50. It's going to be over $10.\nWell, I don't think he does because his answer was weird. You can get it down a few cents? A few cents? No, you get it down many dollars.\nYou have to let the oil companies go back to work. They ended leases they ended ANWAR because of Lisa Murkowski, Who's done a terrible job-\nShe's not a Republican. She says she's a Republican in Alaska. Ronald Reagan tried to get it, Bushes tried, everybody tried to get it. I got it done. It was all done. Maybe it's bigger than Saudi Arabia, maybe. They've tried for many, many decades to get it done. I got it done. This would've added to our supply. We're already the biggest in the world by far. Now we're not the biggest in the world anymore. We've ended all the leases on government lands that frankly were pumping out for years and not hurting it, done in an environmental way. And if you look at natural gas, natural gas is very clean. We got windmills destroying our landscapes, killing all the birds-\nThe energy is so expensive. And you know where the turbines are made? Every one of them-\nGermany, and China.\nWell, it's not because of him they're losing their job, it's because some bad policies that are being made by the Biden administration. But look, if you look at my relationship with Fauci, first of all, he's been there like for 40 years. You walk in and he goes, \"Hi, my name's Tony.\" \"Oh, great. Hi Tony, how you doing?\" But everything he suggested that we do, I didn't do. I went the opposite. He wanted to keep China open, I closed it to China. We would've lost-\nOh, yeah, for a long time. And he actually said, \"President Trump saved thousands and thousands of lives.\" I was the only one. I was sitting in a room, many, many people. I said, \"We have to close it to China.\" I then closed it to Europe because I saw what was going on in Europe. And we saved thousands of lives. And what I did do, and we want freedom and we want all of this, and this was a great achievement though, worldwide, because I think you would've had a 1917, like the Spanish flu where maybe a hundred million people died. That I got the vaccine done, three vaccines, in less than nine months. They said it was going to take five years and it probably wouldn't get done. I got them done and they do work and they're great, I'm very proud of them, but people shouldn't be forced to take them.\nThe biggest anyone's ever seen.\nSo the wall would've stopped them. So the only thing they can do is-\nI know. The wall would've stopped them. The only thing they can do is go to small areas where the wall was going to be completed over the next month. It would've been completed almost immediately, they just had to finish it.\nOkay. Before we start that, let me just tell you, these are rough people. They were going through. The Mexican police, who were tough. They're tough police. They were lined up, they thought they could stop them. You look at that front few lines of the people there on this caravan, a name I came up with because I saw some caravans, but they were tiny and we ended it. We stopped the caravans, we made sure. Now what's happened is they're talking about one caravan, 120,000 people are going to be … that's like an army.\nIf you look at that front line, they look like they belong in the NFL. In fact they should be signed, some of them for the NFL. They burst through tough Mexican police who tried to stop them. They had no chance. We have to stop them. We can stop them but we have to get very tough. Our country is being poisoned. It's being poisoned. And you know what else? It's being poisoned also with drugs. We had fentanyl down to the lowest number since it's founding because fentanyl, if you look, it's worse than anything, it's the worst.\nMuch of it's made in China, and I had him just about stopped. I said, \"Look, we're not doing any business if you're …\" All of a sudden they're making fentanyl like crazy. They're sending it through the border.\nThe numbers on fentanyl have gone up tenfold. I had it, not stopped, but I had it almost stopped. When we would've had the wall completed and a couple of other things, I would've had it down to almost nothing. The fentanyl and drugs generally, are pouring through our border. People that are very sick are coming into our country. Very contagious diseases, many different diseases.\nNot just COVID. By the way, COVID is peanuts compared to some of these diseases. They're pouring through our country. They are destroying these leaders, if you call them leaders, [inaudible] they're destroying our country.\nYou can multiply times seven. I don't know if you know that number. So if they have 1.7, they say you multiply times seven. That's the number that come in totally unchecked.\nAnd the other thing, you're talking about tens of millions of people over a relatively short period of time. Over a two year period of time, we would have more than 10 million people coming into our country. Our country can never be the same. Our country is changed already.\nWell, I've gone to the border many times.\nWell, I just got back. I was there recently. I saw what Biden said, he was there sometime, but he wasn't there.\nBut he wasn't there. I don't think he was even-\nNo, I've been to the border many times. I don't think it helps for me at this moment to go. I'm not the president, he's the president. He's got to go to the border. The Border Patrol people are incredible. When I was there a few months ago, I was there three months ago. They're so incredible. ICE people, and they are tough people. They have to be tough people.\nThey love our country. They really want to do their job. That's the amazing thing. It would be easier if they didn't. They want to do their job. They're tough people, but they're great patriots, and they're being treated with tremendous disrespect.\nGo ahead.\nWell, they quit in protest because they say, \"What's going on over here?\"\nWell, this is America today. It's only going to get worse because you have all of these millions of people, many of them are the worst people. The worst people. Somebody would say, \"Oh, that's not a nice thing to say.\" Some of these people are the absolute worst people.\nAll they want to do is indict Republicans. That's all they do. They want to go after Republicans. They use the DA's, the attorney generals and the federal government. Now sometimes you have fair people, sometimes you don't. They're good at destroying Republicans. They're horrible at destroying crime. They're letting these people that are killers go out. You look at Chicago, go, you look at New York, what's gone on with the crime in New York. New York is like a different place. Here's the good news. It could be changed, otherwise it would be so sad, you wouldn't even want to talk about it. But what's happened to New York, de Blasio is the worst mayor. It's filthy dirty.\nPeople are living on Park Avenue. They're living in tents on the most incredible streets where people come from all over the world and they pay tax, which gives our police the money. They have to refund the police. They have to give the police more money. But what's happening in New York and what's happening in Chicago, where 88 people were shot last month and six died. I don't even know how only six died, 88 people were shot. You look at a weekend. They had a little while ago where they had a weekend, Labor Day weekend, where many people were shot.\nI think that's the least of it. But the art is so terrible. So he's getting a half a million dollars a painting, and I was seeing that a Monet is getting less. It's such a terrible situation. And we're not going to learn who the buyers are. Should I buy one? It will give me great access to the White House.\nFirst of all, the concept of it is ridiculous. And you said he couldn't get in the past … I don't think he ever painted before, I think he just started. So he's learning by the numbers. And let me tell you, I believe that as bad as that is, it's peanuts compared to other things. But it's so obviously horrible. I've had people say, \"That's a terrible thing.\" That is a terrible thing what's going on. And they're getting numbers like nobody has ever gotten.\nIn fact, I'm thinking about opening up my own gallery.\nI think a couple of million dollars a painting. If he gets 500-\nI'll paint, whatever the hell I have to paint to get $2 million.\nThank you, Jeanine. Thank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/donald-trump-interview-with-judge-jeanine-pirro-fox-news"}

Thank you.\nWell, we had a great years and I've been watching what's happening and a lot of people, they were remorseful and they were like, \"Can we do something?\" And it's really pictures of a lot of great things with the military, with so many of the things we've done. And I think it's sort of a happy book. We bring in some negativity what's happening now, but frankly, it's really a happy book and it's a book largely of beautiful pictures, of events that took place, and some of the things we've done.\nWell, he's done a terrible job, just like he did with the H1N1. He's done just an absolutely terrible job, getting it out and getting people to take it. People just don't want to take it. And the vaccines, I have to be very proud of the vaccines. We did it in less than nine months. People said it to take five years to 12 years and probably wouldn't work. They work incredibly well. Some people don't want to take them and that's their freedom and that's what we have to do, but people don't want to take them because they don't trust Biden, they don't trust the administration. We had none of that. Everybody was fighting to take them and we were doing great. We were doing really great on distribution. We also bought billions of dollars worth before we knew it was going to be successful, which saved us one year. So many things we did right, and what they're doing is very sad when you look at what's happening. But more people died during year than last year by a very substantial margin, and sadly, this year is not up.\nWell, a couple of things. Number one, they did a pause on Johnson & Johnson, which really sent shocks through, over six people that didn't die by the way, but six people, and for that millions and millions of shots given, and they did the pause with Johnson & Johnson, that was very bad. And they just haven't been able to sell it. People are not trusting this administration. And if you remember when during the debate, I think she said, and he said, \"Oh, if it's Trump, I won't take the vaccine. I won't take the vaccine.\" And then as soon as he got elected, he tried to claim that he did it, but he forgot that he got a shot during my administration, he got a shot. But there was just a great distrust of what they were saying and what they were doing, and I think that's the problem. And that's why they're trying to set up mandates and really hurting things with the economy, with the mandates, in addition to other things.\nIt is a disaster. We have millions of people flowing across, and we're not only talking about the China virus or COVID, whatever you want to call it. We're talking about many other diseases coming over the border that are far worse, coming over the border. And nobody is being tested, nobody is being checked. Prisons of other countries are being dumped into our country. We're like a dumping ground. We had the strongest border in the history of our country. The wall was largely built, it could have been finished in three weeks and they decided not to finish the openings, it's just some openings.\nWe did an incredible job, 500 miles of wall. And this is why that, coupled with other things gave us the greatest numbers we've ever had, the most successful it's ever been. We take people in, but take them in legally. Now, one other thing that's pouring in right now that nobody even mentioned are drugs. Drugs are coming in at a rate of seven times greater than when I was doing it, and our numbers were going way down. We were having the lowest drug numbers, and if you look at the numbers of people that are coming in now, we're millions and millions of people every couple of months, we're look at a 12, 13, 14, maybe even 15 million people a year, and none of those people are tested.\nWell, they should have never ended it. If Joe Biden would've come in and just gone to the beach, he would've been successful in many ways, because all of this stuff, the border was the best that ever was and getting better, drugs coming in was getting at a level that we've never seen before, meaning-\nNo, because I want to see good for the country, Brian. It's so important to me, I want to see good for the country. There's no gratification. What they're doing is destroying our country. Our country is being destroyed before your very eyes, and I've never seen anything like it. The withdrawal from Afghanistan, I got us there. We were down to 2,500 troops, the Taliban respected us. Abdul, I dealt with him a lot, he respected us. We were going to take the people out. We were going to take some Afghans out, we were going to take our equipment out. We left $85 billion worth of equipment, it's unthinkable, and they had a parade last week showing off all the equipment they took. It was like a surrender. There's never been a lower point in the history of our country. And don't think that China and Russia and North Korea and Iran weren't watching, because that was the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country, in my opinion.\nIf you watch the news recently, you might think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country. That parents won't be able to get presents for their children this holiday season, but here's the deal: for the vast majority of the country, that's not what's happening. I've also spoken with the CEOs of UPS and FedEx, which are on track to deliver more packages than ever. Now, I can't promise that every person will get every gift they want on time, only Santa Claus can keep that promise.\nWell, first of all, it would've never happened. Nobody ever mentioned those words, supply chains, they were never brought up. We had perfect supply chains. We had the greatest economy in history. We then had the China virus, we fixed it, we did a great job with it. And between not only that, the ventilators, all of the different things that we did, stocking up all of the states, which by the way, all of the cupboards were bare, and that includes the United States government. There was nothing there, we did a hell of a job. We've got no credit for it, but maybe someday we will. But we would've never had a supply chain problem, but one of the causes is the mandates because a lot of people aren't working because of forced mandates. That's one of the very big causes.\nAnother thing that's going to be a big problem, and it's a problem like nobody seen before, we were energy independent. We didn't need ships all over the place, clogging up the waters coming in from Saudi Arabia, Russia and other places. We were the biggest in the world. We went to the biggest in the world. Within one year, we would've been bigger than Saudi Arabia and Russia combined with real energy, and it's called liquid gold under our feet. We have an advantage that other countries like China don't have. So many different things, but the mandates had a lot to do with the supply chain problem.\nWell, when you look at San Francisco and you look at 100 kids or people running into a store together, and the cops are standing out there, not allowed to do their job, they're not allowed to do their job. And you allow a thing like that to happen. We have a country has no law enforcement, has no law and order. Our police are great, they're not allowed to do their job. And they're now being hit. People aren't even afraid. They go and shoot police, they don't respect them. The people of our country love our police and they do respect them, but they're not allowed to do their job. If you allowed them to do their job, that would stop and crime would stop, but they're not allowed. You look at what's going on in New York, you look at what's going on in Chicago and look at what's happening in San Francisco.\nAnd it's happening in many other cities that they don't want to report about. The media outside of you people and a few others, the media isn't reporting this problem. But where you have hoarded of people running in, kids mostly, running in and stealing, robbing stores where drug chains are closing all their stores in different cities because they can't keep them open. We just don't have law enforcement. We're not allowed to have law enforcement. I'll tell you what, our country is being destroyed. It should never be allowed to happen. The police have to be given their power back. They have to stop the crime. They can do it and they want to do it, but they're not allowed to do it.\nAnd by the way, before I answer that, none of this happened with us. They didn't send bombers over the middle of Taiwan. He knew not to do that. Had a very good relationship with President Xi. He knew very well, you can't send bombers over Taiwan. None of that stuff happened. And they'll wait until after the Olympics and they'll do something with Taiwan. They no longer respect us. They watched Afghanistan. They watched our generals not knowing what they were doing. They saw all of that and they're watching very closely. They'll be doing things, Russia will be doing things, and maybe even North Korea will be doing things, because they're watching our country. We are psychologically weak. I built a great military. We had jet fighters that were 40 and 50 years old. We have knew everything, we're in such great shape, but you still have to have the brain power to know how to use it. And they watched that withdrawal, and by the way, the withdrawal, get out. 21 years, but you get out with dignity and strength. And we were going to get out with dignity and strength.\nWhat they did, these countries see that. And I'll tell you what, we're in a much different position. With that being said, you hurt the athletes, you hurt a lot of people. I would not do it. Jimmy Carter tried it, it didn't work. I wouldn't do it. That's not the problem. By the way, one other thing. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs from China. We never got 10 cents for 40 years, they never paid us anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars and businesses were starting to come back to us. China respected our country. Russia respected our country. I stopped the pipeline going to Europe, Biden approved it. But of course, he stopped the Keystone pipeline in our country, and others, he's trying to stop. Now, we have a group of people, I don't know if it's Biden, it might not be, but we have a group of people that are destroying our country and perhaps knowingly, destroying our country.\nSo fossil fuels are our strength. It's our advantage, and it also can fire up those big factories and those big plants. You look at what they're doing into our landscape, they're destroying our landscape, our birds, they're destroying with wind. And by the way, those turbines are all made in Germany and they're made in China.\nAnd if you talk about emissions, the making of those turbines, if you really go with the emissions theory, the making is so onerous to the environment that nothing they can do will ever or save anything. And as far as cars, in order to make the batteries of those cars, the electric cars, and now you're not going to have a choice because they want to go all electric. But doing that is going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of people. They don't want to go that way. They're taking our greatest asset, it's right under our feet. We are blessed as a country with tremendous energy reserves under our feet, and they don't want us to use them.\nI think that people are seeing the great job that we did. Again, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We rebuilt our military, we had great military support. You look at the Hispanic support we've had, we had the best Hispanic support. I just think that people are missing us.\nIt is strange because my numbers now are the best they've ever been. I think that's because maybe they look at the opponent and they look at what's happening to our country. Look, I think social media's important. I think we have some very bad people. I think a lot of illegal things were done with social media, you understand when they can do 417 million. If you spend more than $5,600, they put you in jail. And yet here's the guy spend $417 million and nothing happens to him.\nSo, I think social media is fine if it's used properly. And I think we're going to have a platform that's going to be incredible and that's what's being developed right now.\nIt's such an interesting question. I had to move fast. A country was in bad shape, I had to move fast. Some of the niceties like, let's sit down and let's talk very calm. I had to get things going fast. China was ripping us off $500 billion a year. Europe, they sound nice, but they rip us. They're almost as bad as China. We made a new deal with Mexico. We made a new deal with Canada. We made a new deal with Japan. We were doing a lot of things and you had to move fast, and sometimes in order to do that, you can't … I can be as nice as anybody, I think I'm a nice person, but we had to move quickly. And sometimes you have to break the eggs a little bit.\nWell, it's a great question, frankly, and it's somebody who also has had some very successful books. But we wanted to do it quickly because we wanted to give people hope. Our country is just now, there's so many people they're down, and we wanted to give, we wanted to show it. It was a beautiful time. It was unfair. Nobody was ever attacked and hit like I was, but I understood that, and I got it, and I think we also gave it back to them. But we had to do something and you're right, we have millions and millions of pictures, but we picked pictures that we thought really represented the time. And there are a lot of beautiful pictures. Even the rallies, we have pictures of these massive rallies that we have. And the rallies right now are bigger now than even before the election, which is shocking.\nNormally you would think you wouldn't have anybody show up. We had in Alabama, 69,000 people. As an example, we had four rallies that I think were the biggest that we've ever had. We had a tremendous rally in Georgia. We had a tremendous rally in Iowa, unbelievable rally in Iowa, but the numbers are so big and it's really, people want hope. And that's a little bit, and maybe a lot of the reason that I did this book. I think it gives people some hope and to look into a very beautiful time. In many ways, a very beautiful time. COVID came along and we had a fix it, and then we got it going again. So we really did it twice, and now our country's being destroyed.\nNo, that's not true. That's an interesting one. More fake news. No, that's not true.\nShe was a great first lady. She did a great job. She loves the people, they love her. I see how they love her. But no, I will say this. We have to fix our country. Our country is going bad. We're not going to have a country any longer if we keep doing this. When we allow other countries to empty their prisons into our country-\nWell, if you look at the poll numbers, I am, because the poll numbers are 95% and 96% approval rating now in the Republican party, nobody's ever had that. And overall approval numbers are great. So, I'm not going by polls. I'm just saying I did it before and really did it twice. We had it at a level that has never been seen before, and then we brought it back to a level that was really good despite the China virus. And other countries, not one country has fared as well as we have, not one country.\nWe did a good job.\nWell, we had so much success. If you look at-\nIf you look at right to try … Okay, we got the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country. That was a great day. We got the biggest regulation cuts, that was a great number of days. We did Right to Try. So Right to Try, they've been trying to get it for 47 years and I got it. That's where you can use medicine to take people that are terminally ill and allow them to see if this medicine works, and it's been incredibly successful. That wouldn't sound as big as some of the other things we've done, but that was a very big thing. Supreme Court justice as well, they're going to be making a very important ruling soon.\nLet's see how that works out. But I had three, it's very unusual to have three and I got three and they're very good and let's see how that all works out because right now, they're going to be making one of their biggest decisions. And putting in almost 300 judges throughout the United States, it's almost 30% of the judges in the country. So we had a lot of big moments and I could just go on and on, but we had a lot of big moments.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/donald-trump-interview-with-brian-kilmeade-steve-doocy-and-ainsley-earhardt-fox-and"}
{"Title": "Address Accepting the Presidential Nomination at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Date": "2024-07-18", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. And thank you, Dana. Thank you, Kid Rock, sometimes referred to as \"Bob.\" And thank you, Lee, right from the beginning, thank you very much. What a talent. What a beautiful, beautiful song. Thank you.\nFriends, delegates and fellow citizens. I stand before you this evening with a message of confidence, strength and hope. Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory, and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.\nTogether, we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.\nThe discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart.\nI am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America.\nSo tonight, with faith and devotion, I proudly accept your nomination for president of the United States. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. And we will do it right. We're going to do it right.\nLet me begin this evening by expressing my gratitude to the American people for your outpouring of love and support following the assassination attempt at my rally on Saturday.\nAs you already know, the assassin's bullet came within a quarter of an inch of taking my life. So many people have asked me what happened. \"Tell us what happened, please.\" And therefore, I will tell you exactly what happened, and you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's actually too painful to tell.\nIt was a warm, beautiful day in the early evening in Butler Township in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Music was loudly playing, and the campaign was doing really well. I went to the stage and the crowd was cheering wildly. Everybody was happy. I began speaking very strongly, powerfully and happily. Because I was discussing the great job my administration did on immigration at the southern border. We were very proud of it.\nBehind me, and to the right, was a large screen that was displaying a chart of border crossings under my leadership. The numbers were absolutely amazing. In order to see the chart, I started to, like this, turn to my right, and was ready to begin a little bit further turn, which I'm very lucky I didn't do, when I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard. On my right ear. I said to myself, \"Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.\"\nAnd moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood. Just absolutely blood all over the place. I immediately knew it was very serious. That we were under attack. And in one movement proceeded to drop to the ground. Bullets were continuing to fly as very brave Secret Service agents rushed to the stage. And they really did. They rushed to the stage.\nThese are great people at great risk, I will tell you, and pounced on top of me so that I would be protected. There was blood pouring everywhere, and yet in a certain way I felt very safe because I had God on my side. I felt that.\nThe amazing thing is that prior to the shot, if I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark and I would not be here tonight. We would not be together. The most incredible aspect of what took place on that terrible evening, in the fading sun, was actually seen later. In almost all cases, as you probably know. And when even a single bullet is fired, just a single bullet, and we had many bullets that were being fired, crowds run for the exits or stampede. But not in this case. It was very unusual.\nThis massive crowd of tens of thousands of people stood by and didn't move an inch. In fact, many of them bravely but automatically stood up, looking for where the sniper would be. They knew immediately that it was a sniper. And then began pointing at him. You can see that if you look at the group behind me. That was just a small group compared to what was in front.\nNobody ran and, by not stampeding, many lives were saved. But that isn't the reason that they didn't move. The reason is that they knew I was in very serious trouble. They saw it. They saw me go down. They saw the blood, and thought, actually most did, that I was dead.\nThey knew it was a shot to the head. They saw the blood. And there's an interesting statistic. The ears are the bloodiest part. If something happens with the ears they bleed more than any other part of the body. For whatever reason the doctors told me that.\nAnd I said, \"Why is there so much blood?\"\nHe said, \"It's the ears, they bleed more.\"\nSo we learned something. But they just —\nThey just, this beautiful crowd, they didn't want to leave me. They knew I was in trouble. They didn't want to leave me. And you can see that love written all over their faces. True.\nIncredible people. They're incredible people. Bullets were flying over us, yet I felt serene. But now the Secret Service agents were putting themselves in peril. They were in very dangerous territory.\nBullets were flying right over them, missing them by a very small amount of inches. And then it all stopped. Our Secret Service sniper, from a much greater distance and with only one bullet used, took the assassin's life. Took him out.\nI'm not supposed to be here tonight. Not supposed to be here.\n[Crowd chants \"Yes, you are.\"]\nThank you. But I'm not. And I'll tell you. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God.\nAnd watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was. When I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didn't know I was looking out; they thought it was over.\nBut I could see it and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting and started shouting, \"Fight, fight, fight.\"\nThank you.\nOnce my clenched fist went up, and it was high into the air, you've all seen that, the crowd realized I was OK and roared with pride for our country like no crowd I have ever heard before. Never heard anything like it.\nFor the rest of my life, I will be grateful for the love shown by that giant audience of patriots that stood bravely on that fateful evening in Pennsylvania. Tragically, the shooter claimed the life of one of our fellow Americans: Corey Comperatore. Unbelievable person, everybody tells me. Unbelievable.\nAnd seriously wounded two other great warriors. Spoke to them today: David Dutch and James Copenhaver. Two great people. I also spoke to all three families of these tremendous people.\nOur love and prayers are with them and always will be. We're never going to forget them. They came for a great rally. They were serious Trumpsters, I want to tell you. They were serious Trumpsters and still are. But Corey, unfortunately, we have to use the past tense.\nHe was incredible. Yeah. He was a highly respected former fire chief. Respected by everybody. Was accompanied by his wife, Helen. Incredible woman. I spoke to her today. Devastated. And two precious daughters. He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets. He went right over the top of them and was hit. What a fine man he was.\nI want to thank the fire department and the family for sending his helmet, his outfit and it was just something, and they're going to do something very special when they get it.\nBut we did something which cannot match what happened. Not even close. But I am very proud to say that over the past few days we've raised $6.3 million. For the families of David, James and Corey. Including from a friend of mine just — called up, he sent me a check, right here, just got it. One million dollars. From Dan Newlin, thank you, Dan.\nAnd again, when speaking to the family, I told them, I said, \"Well, I'm going to be sending a lot of money, but it can't compensate.\"\nThey all said the same thing: \"You're right, sir; we appreciate so much what you're doing, but nothing can take the place, in the case of Corey.\" And the other two. By the way, they were very, very seriously injured. But now they're doing very well. They're going to be OK. They're going to be doing very well. They're warriors.\nSo now, I ask that we observe a moment of silence in honor of our friend Corey. There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for others. This is the spirit that forged America in her darkest hours. And this is the love that will lead America back to the summit of human achievement and greatness. This what we need.\nDespite such a heinous attack, we unite this evening, more determined than ever. I am more determined than ever and so are you. So is everybody in this room.\n[Crowd chants, \"We love Trump.\"]\nThank you. Thank you very much. Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged, to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before. Nothing will stop me in this mission, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure.\nNo matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break. We will not bend. We will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you, your family and our magnificent country. Never.\nAnd everything I have to give with all of the energy and fight in my heart and soul, I pledge to our nation tonight. Thank you very much. I pledge that to our nation. We're going to turn our nation around and we're going to do it very quickly. Thank you.\nThis election should be about the issues facing our country and how to make America successful, safe, free and great again.\nIn an age when our politics too often divide us, now is the time to remember that we are all fellow citizens — we are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\nAnd we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement, which is what's been happening in our country lately, at a level that nobody has ever seen before. In that spirit, the Democrat party should immediately stop weaponizing the justice system and labeling their political opponent as an enemy of democracy. Especially since that is not true. In fact, I am the one saving democracy for the people of our country.\nAnd very big news, as you probably just read. On Monday, a major ruling was handed down from a highly respected federal judge in Florida, Aileen Cannon, finding that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional, and the entire case was thrown out of court. With all of that publicity — thrown out of court.\nIf Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts, which I've been going through for approximately eight years. And they should do that without delay and allow an election to proceed that is worthy of our people. We're going to win it anyway.\nBut worthy of our people.\nOn this journey, I am deeply honored to be joined by my amazing wife, Melania. And, Melania, thank you very much. You also did something really beautiful, a letter to America calling for national unity. And it really took the Republican Party by surprise, I will tell you; it was beautiful. In fact, some very serious people said that we should take that letter and put it as part of the Republican platform. That would be an honor, wouldn't it? Right? Mr. congressman? But it captivated so many, so …\nI also want to thank my entire family — Don and Kimberly, Ivanka and Jared, Eric and Lara, Tiffany and Michael, Barron, we love our Barron. And of course, my 10 wonderful grandchildren.\nYou saw a few of them up there on my lap before. And how good was Dana? Was Dana good? I mean, wasn't he good? You know, he was on probably the only vacation he's had in about — maybe ever. Because he works. But about 10 years, with his wife — very far away. I won't tell you where, but very, very far away, beautiful place.\nAnd my people called and he said, \"Yeah, I won't be able to do it. This is many, many years. I promised my wife. I can't do it.\" And they came and they said, \"Dana won't be able to do it.\" Because he was my first, second and third choice. I said, \"Well, you know, that's too bad.\" But I understand, he's away and it's good. It's good for him. And that was it. About 30 minutes later, she came back in: \"Sir, Dana just called; he's going to do it.\" And his wife, she said, \"You can't turn him down. You just can't do it. You have to go.\" That's a good wife.\nSo he got in a plane, he got here a little while ago. Now he's going to get on the plane in a little while and he's going to go back home to his wife. But they're great. And I just want to thank her and him and their whole family because that's not easy.\nAnd Kid Rock, same thing. Called, he said, \"I want to be a part of it.\" I want to be a part, because, you know, Kid does this great song. Big, big monster song. I had no idea. You know, he became a friend of mine over the last 10 years. And, uh, he's amazing. Everyone loves him.\nI didn't even know how big he was. You know, he has rallies. Thirty-five, 40,000 people he gets, every time he goes out. I think he's making so much money he doesn't know what the hell to do with it, you want to know ...\nAnd then we have my other friend, and I've known him so long and we took that song and it was a big success. But we made that. I saw a chart of great songs to America. That was No. 1 on the chart recently. No. 1, so. That's Lee Greenwood, very special, beautiful person. He's a beautiful man.\nBut they all wanted to be here. They called … And how about the Hulkster? How good was he? You see that? Where is he? Boy, oh boy.\nYou know, they may call it, they may call that entertainment. I know about entertainment, but when he used to lift a 350-pound man over his shoulders and then bench press him two rows into the audience, I say maybe entertainment, but he is one strong son of a gun, I tell you. I watched it many times. There aren't a lot of entertainers that could do that, right? You were fantastic. Thank you very much.\nFollowed by … Eric? What was that all about? Boy, that was good. I didn't want to really come up here.\nBut he was so great. And he's such a good young man. He went through a lot of trouble, and Don, last night, was incredible. They went through so much trouble. They got subpoenaed more than any people probably in the history of the United States. Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole thing. Just boom, boom, boom.\nThey've got to stop that because they're destroying our country. We have to work on making America great again, not on beating people. And we won. We beat them in all. We beat them on the impeachments. We beat them on the indictments. We beat them. But the time that you have to spend, the time that you have to spend. If they would devote that genius to helping our country, we'd have a much stronger and better country.\nAnd Jason. The biggest star in country music. Jason, thank you for being here. Jason, thank you very much. Jason Aldean, he's good. I like his wife even better, by the way. She's here. Thank you, Jason.\nBut I'm thrilled to have a new friend and partner fighting by my side: the next vice president of the United States, the current senator from Ohio, J.D. Vance, and his incredible wife, Usha.\nHe's going to be a great vice president, he's going to be great. He'll be with this country and with this movement. Greatest movement in the history of our country. Make America Great Again. When they criticize it, they say, \"We're going to try and stop MAGA.\" MAGA is \"Make America Great Again.\" What are you going to stop? There's nothing to stop. Then they say, \"Oh, that's right.\" It's very tough to fight it.\nAnd all of the people that did try and fight it have failed, but he's going to be with us for a long time, and it was an honor to select him. Great, great student at Yale. His wife was a student at Yale; they met at Yale. These are two smart people. So J.D., you're going to be doing this for a long time; enjoy the ride.\nAnd a very special thank you to the extraordinary people of Milwaukee and the great state of — oh, there they are. There they are, that's — You are so easy to spot. And Green Bay's going to have a good team this year, right? They're going to have a good team. They're going to have a good team. Most of the audience doesn't like it, but it's true. You're going to have a very good team this year.\nAnd by the way, Wisconsin, we are spending over $250 million here, creating jobs and other economic … development all over the place. So I hope you will remember this in November and give us your vote. I am trying to buy your vote. I'll be honest about that. And I promise we will make Wisconsin great again. We're going to make this ... Thank you. Mr. governor, thank you very much. Thank you.\nI am here tonight to lay out a vision for the whole nation. To every citizen, whether you're a young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, Black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship.\nTogether, we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the world has never seen before.\nWe were right there in the first term. We got hit with Covid. We did a great job. Nobody knew what it was. But nobody's ever seen an economy pre-Covid, and then we handed over a stock market that was substantially higher than just prior to Covid. Coming in, did a great job. Never got credit for that. We got credit for the war and defeating ISIS and so many things. The great economy. The biggest tax cuts ever. The biggest regulation cuts ever. The creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much. We do so much.\nRight to Try, Right to Try is a big deal. We've got Right to Try. They were trying to get that for 52 years. Somebody's terminally ill. And hopefully there's nobody in this audience, but it does happen, a lot. They're terminally ill and they can't use our new space-age drugs and other things that we are way ahead with. We have the greatest doctors in the world. The greatest laboratories in the world, and you can't do it. They've been trying to get that approved for 52 years, wasn't that easy. The insurance companies didn't want to do it. They didn't want the risk. The labs didn't want to do it because if it didn't work, people are pretty far down the line toward death. They didn't want to do it. The doctors didn't want to have it on their record.\nSo I got everybody into an office — 52 years, they tried. Sounds simple, but it's not. And I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will, instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place, or if you have no money, going home and dying — just die — we got them to sign an agreement. They agreed to it, where they're not going to sue anybody. They can get all of this stuff. They're going to get it really fast, and what's happened is we're saving thousands and thousands of lives. It's incredible. Right to Try. It's … great feeling.\nUnder our leadership, the United States will be respected again. No nation will question our power. No enemy will doubt our might. Our borders will be totally secure. Our economy will soar. We will return law and order to our streets, patriotism to our schools, and importantly, we will restore peace, stability and harmony all throughout the world.\nBut to achieve this future, we must first rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership. We have totally incompetent leadership. This will be the most important election in the history of our country.\nUnder the current administration, we are indeed a nation in decline.\nWe have an inflation crisis that is making life unaffordable, ravaging the incomes of working and low-income families, and crushing, just simply crushing our people like never before. They've never seen anything like it.\nWe also have an illegal immigration crisis, and it's taking place right now, as we sit here in this beautiful arena. It's a massive invasion at our southern border that has spread misery, crime, poverty, disease, and destruction to communities all across our land. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.\nThen there is an international crisis, the likes of which the world has seldom been part of. Nobody can believe what's happening. War is now raging in Europe and the Middle East, a growing specter of conflict hangs over Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, and all of Asia, and our planet is teetering on the edge of World War III, and this will be a war like no other war because of weaponry. The weapons are no longer army tanks going back and forth, shooting at each other. These weapons are obliteration.\nIt's time for a change. This administration can't come close to solving the problems. We're dealing with very tough, very fierce people. They're fierce people. And we don't have fierce people. We have people that are a lot less than fierce, except when it comes to cheating on elections and a couple of other things, then they're fierce. Then they're fierce.\nSo tonight, I make this pledge to the great people of America.\nI will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy . We will drill, baby, drill. Can you believe what they're doing?\nBut by doing that, we will lead a large-scale decline in prices. Prices will start to come down.\nEnergy… Raised it, they took our energy policies and destroyed them. Then they immediately went back to them, but by that time, so much was lost. But we will do it at levels that nobody's ever seen before, and we'll end lots of different things. We'll start paying off debt and start lowering taxes even further. We gave you the largest tax cut. We'll do it more.\nNow, people don't realize, I brought taxes way down, way, way down. And yet we took in more revenues the following year than we did when the tax rate was much higher. Most people said, how did you do that? Because it was incentive. Everybody was coming to the country, they were bringing back billions and billions of dollars into our country. The companies made it impossible to bring it back. The tax rate was too high and the legal complications were far too great. I changed both of them, and hundreds of billions of dollars by Apple and so many other companies would work back into our nation, and we had an economy the likes of which nobody, no nation had ever seen. China, we were beating them at levels that were incredible. And they know it. They know it. We'll do it again, but we'll do it even better.\nI will end the illegal immigration crisis by closing our border and finishing the wall, most of which I've already built.\nOn the wall, we were dealing with a very difficult Congress and I said, \"Oh, that's OK. We won't go to Congress.\" I call it an \"invasion.\" We gave our military almost $800 billion. I said, \"I'm going to take a little of that money, because this is an 'invasion.'\" And we built — Most of the wall is already built, and we built it through using the funds, because what's more, what's better than that? We have to stop the invasion into our country that's killing hundreds of thousands of people a year. We're not going to let that happen.\nI will end every single international crisis that the current administration has created, including the horrible war with Russia and Ukraine, which would have never happened if I was president. And the war caused by the attack on Israel, which would never have happened if I was president. Iran was broke. Iran had no money. Now Iran has $250 billion. They made it all over the last two and a half years. They were broke.\nI watched the other day on a show called \"Deface the Nation,\" has anyone seen it? And they had a congressman who was a Democrat say, Well, whether you like him or not, Iran was broke dealing with Trump. I told China and other countries, \"If you buy from Iran, we will not let you do any business in this country, and we will put tariffs on every product you do send in of 100 percent or more.\" And they said to me, Well, I think that's about it. They weren't going to buy any oil. And they were ready to make a deal. Iran was going to make a deal with us.\nAnd then we had that horrible, horrible result that we'll never let happen again. The election result. We're never going to let that happen again. They used Covid to cheat. We're never going to let it happen again. And they took off all the sanctions, and they did everything possible for Iran and now Iran is very close to having a nuclear weapon, which would have never happened.\nThis is a shame, what this administration, the damage that this administration has done. And I say it often. If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States. Think of it. The 10 worst. Added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done. Only going to use the term once. Biden. I'm not going to use the name anymore. Just one time. The damage that he's done to this country is unthinkable. It's unthinkable.\nTogether, we will restore vision, strength, competence and we're going to have a thing called common sense making most of our decisions actually. It's all common sense.\nJust a few short years ago under my presidency, we had the most secure border and the best economy in the history of our country, in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had never done anything like it. We were beating every country, including China, by leaps and bounds. Nobody had seen anything like it.\nWe had no inflation, soaring incomes, we're going —\nNobody's —\nNobody can believe it. You can't believe what happened four years ago is happening now in reverse.\nAnd the world was at peace. Inflation has been a killer for our country. No matter what you're making, it doesn't matter because inflation is eating you alive. People that were putting away money, they were making great wages. The highest they've ever made. But they were putting away a lot of money. Now they are just being destroyed. They're not putting away anything. They're barely living. They're going into saving accounts. They're taking out their money to live because of inflation.\nInflation, remember, it's called a country buster. You can go back to Germany from 100 years ago. You can go back to any country that's suffered great inflation. We've suffered the worst inflation we've ever had. But go back and see what's happened to those countries. We've had the worst inflation we've ever had under this person.\nBut in less than four years, our opponents have turned incredible success into unparalleled tragedy and failure. It's been a tremendous failure.\nToday, our cities are flooded with illegal aliens. Americans are being squeezed out of the labor force and their jobs are taken. By the way, you know who's taking the jobs, the jobs that are created? One hundred and seven percent of those jobs are taken by illegal aliens.\nAnd you know who's being hurt the most by millions of people pouring into our country? The Black population and the Hispanic population. Because they're taking the jobs from our Black population, our Hispanic population. And they're also taking them from unions. The unions are suffering because of it.\nThank you. Thank you. I like you too. Thank you very much.\nInflation has wiped out the life savings of our citizens, and forced the middle class into a state of depression and despair. That's what it is. It's despair and depression.\nWe cannot, and will not, let this continue. Less than four years ago, we were a great nation, and we will soon be a great nation again. We're going to be a great nation again. Thank you.\nWith proper leadership, every disaster we are now enduring will be fixed — and it will be fixed very, very quickly.\nSo tonight, whether you've supported me in the past or not, I hope you will support me in the future, because I will bring back the American dream. That's what we're going to do. You don't even hear about the American dream anymore.\nWith great humility, I am asking you to be excited about the future of our country. Be excited. Be excited.\nAnd by the way, the news reports. All, look at all of those big networks. Look at them. They're all here. But everyone one of them has said this could be the most organized, best run and most enthusiastic convention of either party that they've ever seen. Every single one.\nAnd it's true. It's true. And there's love in the room. There's great love in the room.\nSo I'd better finish strong. Otherwise, we'll blow it, and we can't let that happen. No, this was great. All of the great people that spoke and everybody hit a home run. I mean, there's not one that I can think of where I said, \"Oh, gee, that wasn't great.\" Every single person. I refuse to be the only one. Don't do that to me. They're already getting ready. See, I gave them an idea.\nNo, we had a, this was a great convention. This was —\nI think we're actually going to go home and miss it. You know usually with a —\nFirst of all, look at these crowds. You'd never have this at a convention. Look at these crowds. Love, it's about love.\nThis week, the entire Republican Party has formally adopted an agenda for America's renewal. And you saw that agenda, and it's very short compared to the long, boring, meaningless agendas of the past. Including the Democrats. They write these things that are hundreds of pages long and they never read them after they're done. In their case, fortunately they don't read them because they're pretty bad.\nIt's a series of bold promises that we will swiftly implement when you give us a Republican House. And Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. We have our great speaker of the House with us tonight. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Thank you.\nA Republican Senate. We have many senators here. And send me back to our beautiful White House just a few short months from now. We're talking about just months. It can't come fast enough. We have to get it done.\nFirst, we must get economic relief to our citizens. Starting on Day 1, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again. We have to make it affordable. It's not affordable. People can't live like this.\nUnder this administration, our current administration, groceries are up 57 percent, gasoline is up 60 and 70 percent, mortgage rates have quadrupled, and the fact is it doesn't matter what they are because you can't get the money anyway. Can't buy houses. Young people can't get any financing to buy a house. The total household costs have increased an average of $28,000 per family under this administration.\nRepublicans have a plan to bring down prices, and bring them down very, very rapidly. By slashing energy costs, we will in turn reduce the cost of transportation, manufacturing and all household goods. So much starts with energy. And remember, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other country by far. We are a nation that has the opportunity to make an absolute fortune with its energy. We have it and China doesn't. Under the Trump administration just three and a half years ago, we were energy independent. But soon we will actually be better than that. We will be energy dominant and supply not only ourselves, but we will supply the rest of the world.\nWith numbers that nobody has ever seen and we will reduce our debt, $36 trillion. We will start reducing that. And we will also reduce your taxes still further. Next, and by the way they want to raise your taxes four times. Think of it. And all my life I grew up watching politicians. I always loved politics, I guess. I was on the other side. I'd watch the — and they were always talking about we will give you a tax cut, we will give you a tax cut. My whole life I was watching I will give you a tax cut, right Mr. Congressman? That's all they talked about. This is the only administration that said we're going to raise your taxes by four times what you're paying now. And people are supposed to vote for them? I've never heard it. You're paying too much, we're going to reduce your taxes still further. We gave you the biggest one, as I said. We're going to give you more and it's going to lead to tremendous growth. We want growth in our country. That's what's going to pay off our debt.\nAnd next, we will end the ridiculous and actually incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that is fueling the inflation crisis. They've spent trillions of dollars of things having to do with the Green New Scam. It's a scam. And that has caused tremendous inflationary pressures in addition to the cost of energy.\nAnd all of the trillions of dollars that are sitting there not yet spent, we will redirect that money for important projects like roads, bridges, dams and we will not allow it to be spent on the meaningless Green New scam ideas.\nAnd I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one. Thereby saving the U.S. auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now and saving U.S. customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car.\nAnd right now as we speak, large factories, just started, are being built across the border in Mexico. So, with all the other things happening at our border, and they're being built by China to make cars and to sell them into our country, no tax, no anything. The United Autoworkers ought to be ashamed for allowing this to happen and the leader of the United Auto Workers should be fired immediately and every single autoworker, union and nonunion, should be voting for Donald Trump because we're going to bring back car manufacturing and we're going to bring it back fast.\nThey are building some of the largest auto plants anywhere in the world. Think of it. In the world. And we are going to bring it back. We're going to make them. We don't mind the —\nWe don't mind it happening but plants will be built in the United States and our people are going to man those plants. And if they don't agree with us, we'll put a tariff of approximately 100 to 200 percent on each car and they will be unsellable in the United States.\nWe have long been taken advantage of by other countries. And think of it, oftentimes these other countries are considered so-called allies. They've taken advantage of us for years.\nWe lose jobs. We lose revenue and they gain everything and wipe out our businesses, wipe out our people. I stopped it for four years, I stopped it. And we're really ready to make changes like nobody had seen before. And remember, U.S.M.C.A. I got rid of NAFTA the worst trade deal ever made and replaced it with U.S.M.C.A. which is, they say, the best trade deal ever made. Actually, probably the best trade deal was the deal I made with China where they buy $50 billion of our product. They were buying nothing. They buy $50 billion worth. They had to but I don't even talk about it because of Covid. I don't even mention it frankly because of what happened with the China virus.\nWe will not let countries come in, take our jobs, and plunder our nation. They come and do that. They plunder our nation.\nThe way they will sell their product in America is to build it in America, very simple. Build it in America and only in America. And this very simple formula, and congress has to go along with us and they will. This very simple formula will create massive numbers of jobs. We will take over the auto industry again and many many, hundreds of thousands of jobs, we lost so many jobs over the years. If you go back 20, 25 years they've stolen, going to China and Mexico, about 68 percent of our auto industry. Manufacturing jobs. We're going to get them all back. We're going to get them all back, every single one of them.\nAt the center of our plan for economic relief are massive tax cuts for workers that include something else that stood out to be very popular actually. Here it's very popular. In this building and all those hotels that are so nice, I'm staying in a nice one. It's called no tax on tips. No tax on tips. No tax on tips.\nAnd I got that by having dinner recently in Nevada where we're leading by about 14 points.\nHello. I'll see you there very soon, everybody.\nAnd we were having dinner at a beautiful restaurant in the Trump building on the Strip. And it's a great building and the waitress comes over.\n\"How's everything going?\"\nReally nice person.\n\"How's everything going?\"\n\"Oh sir, it's so tough. The government is after me all the time on tips, tips, tips.\"\nI said, \"Well, they give you cash, would they be able to find them?\"\nAnd she said, \"Actually,\" and I didn't know this, very little cash is given. It's all put right on the check. And they come in and they take so much of our money it's just ridiculous. And they don't believe anything we say. They've just hired, as you know, 88,000 agents to go after them even more.\nAnd I said, \"This shows the level of—\"\nYou know, most people who go out they hire consultants.\nThey pay them of dollars.\nBut I said to her, \"Let me just ask you a question. Would you be happy if you had no tax on tips?\"\nShe said, \"What a great idea.\"\nI got my information from a very smart waitress. That's better than spending millions of dollars. And everybody, everybody loves it. Waitresses and caddies and drivers and everybody. It's a large, large group of people that are being hurt badly. They make money, let them keep their money.\nI am going to protect Social Security and Medicare. Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people, by the millions, they're coming in. They're going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things and you're not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare.\nUnder my plan, incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back, and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before and we're going to do it very rapidly.\nBut no hope or dream we have for America can succeed unless we stop the illegal immigrant invasion. The worst that's ever been seen anywhere in the world. There's never been an invasion anywhere. Third world countries would fight with sticks and stones not to let this happen. The invasion at our southern border, we will stop it and we will stop it quickly. You heard Tom Homan yesterday. Tom Homan, put him in charge and just sit back and watch. Brandon Judd, a border patrol, he's incredible. These guys they, you know, they, they really their job is a lot easier if they don't have to do anything but they want to. They're patriots.\nBrandon Judd. Border Patrol. ICE. ICE goes out. You have to see what ICE does with M.S. 13. You have, these, these are probably the worst gang and ICE goes in there. And I know a lot of people in these rows here. And they're very tough people. But they don't want to do this job. They'll go into a pack of M.S. 13 killers. They're the worst, probably the worst gangs in the world. We have thousands of them. I moved thousands and thousands out in my four years. We moved them out. And it was a pleasure, but ICE would go right into a pack of these killers. And you see fist flying, you see everything flying and they take them. They put them in a paddy wagon. They take them back and they get them out of our country. And the other countries weren't accepting them back. And I called up and I said tell them that we're not giving them economic aid any more. And the next day I got calls from all these countries that were terminated. Billions of dollars we spend on economic aid to countries that does us frankly no good. And the next day I was called by everybody, I couldn't take all the calls.\n\"Sir, sir, what's the problem?\"\nI said, \"You won't take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. You won't take them back.\"\n\"Well sir, if you'd like us to, we would give very serious consideration to doing that.\"\nIn 24 hours, they were being taken back. For years and years when I first came in, they said President Obama tried to get them to go back and they wouldn't accept them. They'd put planes on the runway so you couldn't land the plane. They'd close the roads so you couldn't take the buses; they'd all have to turn back.\nAs soon as they said no more economic aid of any kind to any country that does that, they called back and they said, \"Sir, it would be our great honor to take M.S. 13. We love them very much. We love them very much, sir. We'll take them back.\"\nAt the heart of the Republican platform is our pledge to end this border nightmare, and fully restore the sacred and sovereign borders of the United States of America. And we're going to do that on Day 1.\nThat means two things on Day 1, right? Drill, baby, drill and close our borders.\nAnd by the way, and I think everybody as a Republican, as a patriot in this. Less than four years ago, I handed this administration the strongest border in American history. But you can see on the chart that saved my life. That was the chart that saved my life. I said, \"Look at, I'm so proud of it.\" I think it's one of the greatest — it was done by the Border Patrol — one of the greatest charts I've ever seen. It showed everything, just like that. You know the chart. Oh, there it is. That's pretty good. Wow.\nLast time I put up that chart I never really got to look at it. But without that chart, I would not be here today. Never got to look at it. I said, \"You've got to see this chart.\" I was so proud of it. But by the time I got to there. I never got to see it that day. But I'm seeing it now and I was very proud.\nIf you look at the arrow on the bottom, that's the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow, that's the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history. Right there. Right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest. And if you go out a little bit further, it's getting to be a little bit old, but I love it anyway right, but you can go much higher with those numbers.\nLook what happened right after that. The invasion began. We had the opposite. We stopped the invasion. But the invasion we stopped was peanuts by comparison to what happened after I left. Look at what happened after I left. They took over our country.\nWe ended all catch-and-release. We shut down asylum fraud. We stopped human trafficking and forged historic agreements to keep illegal aliens on foreign soil. We want them to stay on their soil.\nUnder the Trump administration, if you came in illegally, you were apprehended immediately and you were deported. You went right back.\nThe current administration terminated every single one of those great Trump policies that I put in place to seal the border. I wanted a sealed border. Again, come in but come in legally. You know how unfair it is? So many people, hundreds of thousands of people have been working for years to come into our country. And now they see these people pour into our country at levels that are unprecedented. So unfair. And we're not going to do it. We're not going to stand for it.\nThey suspended wall construction, ended \"Remain in Mexico.\" We had a policy, \"Remain in Mexico.\" You think that was easy to get from the Mexican government? But I said, \"You must give it to us. If you don't give it to us, there will be repercussions.\" And they gave it to us, but not easy.\nCanceled our Safe Third agreements, demolished Title 42, implemented nationwide catch-and-release. That's catch-and-release where we catch them and release them into our country. I had we catch them and release them into Mexico. There's a slight difference. And took 93, this is the previous administration, 93 executive actions to throw open our border to the world. The entire world is pouring into our country because of this very foolish administration.\nThe greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, Middle East. They're coming from everywhere. They're coming at levels that we've never seen before. It is an invasion indeed, and this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them.\nThey're coming from prisons. They're coming from jails. They're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I, you know the press is always on because I say this. Has anyone seen \"The Silence of the Lambs\"? The late, great Hannibal Lecter. He'd love to have you for dinner. That's insane asylums. They're emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists at numbers that we've never seen before. Bad things are going to happen.\nMeanwhile, our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down. Because they're taking their criminals and they're putting them into our country. A certain country, and I happen to like the president of that country very much, but he's been getting great publicity because he's a wonderful shepherd of the country.\nHe says how well the country's doing because their crime rate is down. And he said he's training all of these rough people. They're rough, rough, rough. He's training them. And I've been reading about this for two years. I think, \"Oh that's wonderful, let's take a look at it.\" But then I realize he's not training them; he's sending all of his criminals, his drug dealers, his people that are in jails, he's sending them all to the United States. And he's different in that he doesn't say that.\nHe's trying to convince everybody what a wonderful job he does in running the country. Well, he doesn't do a wonderful job. And by the way, if I ran one of the countries, many countries, many, many countries from all over, I would be worse than any of them. I would have had the place totally emptied out already.\nBut we have become a dumping ground for the world, which is laughing at us. They think we're stupid. And they can't believe that they're getting away with what they're getting away with, but they're not going to be getting away with it for long. That's what I can tell you.\nIn Venezuela, Caracas, high crime, high crime. Caracas, Venezuela, really a dangerous place. But not anymore, because in Venezuela, crime is down 72 percent. In fact, if they would ever in this election, I hate to even say that, we will have our next Republican convention in Venezuela because it will be safe. Our cities, our cities will be so unsafe we won't be able, we will not be able to have it there.\nIn El Salvador, murders are down 70 percent. Why are they down? Now, he would have you convinced that because he's trained murderers to be wonderful people, no. They're down because they're sending their murderers to the United States of America. This is going to be very bad. And bad things are going to happen.\nAnd you're seeing all the time. That's why, to keep our family safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country. Even larger than that of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from many years ago. You know, he was a moderate but he believed very strongly in borders. He had the largest deportation operation we've ever had.\nJust recently, I spoke to the grieving mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a wonderful woman. A precious 12 year-old girl from Houston who last month was tied up, assaulted and strangled to death after walking to the convenience store just a block away from her house. Her body was dumped near the side of the road in a shallow creek, found by some onlookers who couldn't believe what they had witnessed. Charged with Jocelyn's heinous murder, two illegal aliens from Venezuela who came across our border, were in custody and were then released into the country by this horrible, horrible administration that we have right now.\nI also met recently with the heartbroken mother and sister of Rachel Morin. Rachel was a 37-year-old mom of five beautiful children who was brutally raped and murdered while out on a run. She wanted to keep herself in good shape. It was very important to her. She was murdered. The monster responsible first killed another woman in El Salvador before he was let into America by the White House. This White House let them in. He then attacked a 9-year-old girl and her mother in a home invasion in Los Angeles before murdering Rachel in Maryland. Traveled all throughout the country, doing tremendous damage. Rachel's mother will never be the same. I spent time with her. She will never be the same.\nI've also met with the wonderful family of Laken Riley, the brilliant 22-year-old nursing student. She was so proud of being first in her class, who was out for a run on the campus of the University of Georgia when she was assaulted, beaten and horrifically killed. Yet another American life was stolen by a criminal alien set free by this administration. These were incredible people we're talking about. These were incredible people who died.\nTonight, America, this is my vow. I will not let these killers and criminals into our country. I will keep our sons and daughters safe.\nAs we bring security to our streets, we will help bring stability to the world.\nI was the first president in modern times to start no new wars. You know, we were the toughest. We were the most respected. And you saw this. Hungary, strong country. Run by a very powerful, tough leader. He's a tough guy. The press doesn't like him because he's tough. And he came out recently. They were asking him at an interview: The whole world is exploding, what's happening, what's going on. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, very tough man. He said, \"I don't want people coming into my country and blowing up our shopping centers and killing people.\"\nBut they said to him, \"Tell us, what's going wrong? What's happening? What is it?\"\nHe said, \"There's only one way you're going to solve it. You got to bring President Trump back to the United States because he kept everybody at bay.\"\nTrue. He used a word I wouldn't use because I can't use that word. Because you'd say it was braggadocious. The press would say, \"He was a braggart.\" I am not a braggart.\nBut Viktor Orban said it. He said \"Russia was afraid of him. China was afraid of him. Everybody was afraid of him. Nothing was going to happen.\"\nThe whole world was at peace, and now the world is blowing up around us. All of these things you read about were not going to happen.\nUnder President Bush, Russia invaded Georgia. Under President Obama, Russia took Crimea. Under the current administration, Russia is after all of Ukraine. Under President Trump, Russia took nothing.\nWe defeated 100 percent of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was said to take \"five years, sir, it'll take five years, sir.\" We did it in a matter of a couple months. We have a great military. Our military is not woke. It's just some of the fools on top that are woke.\nI got along very well, North Korea, Kim Jung Un. I got along very well with him. The press hated when I said that.\n\"How could you get along with him?\"\nWell, you know, it's nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons or otherwise. See, in the old days, you'd say that's a wonderful thing. Now they say, \"How can you possibly do that?\"\nBut no, I got along with him and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now, North Korea is acting up again. But when we get back, I get along with him. He'd like to see me back too. I think he misses me, if you want to know the truth.\nOur opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war. We're in a planet of war. Look at that attack on Israel. Look at what's happening with Ukraine. The cities are just bombed out. How can people live like that, where buildings, massive buildings are falling to the ground.\nIt began to unravel with the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the worst humiliation in the history of our country. We have never had a humiliation like that. Thirteen heroic U.S. service members were tragically and needlessly killed. Forty-five others were horrifically wounded. Nobody ever talks about that. No arms, no legs, face explosions. Horrifically, horrifically wounded. And by the way, we have a man in this room who is running for the U.S. Senate from a great state, Nevada, named Sam Brown, who paid the ultimate price. Thank you, Sam. Thank you, Sam. Thank you. He paid the biggest price probably ever paid by anybody that is running for office, and I think he is going to do great. He's running against a person that is not good, not respected. A total lightweight.\nBut Sam, I think, paid really —\nWe were talking about it with some of the senators that are working so hard for Sam. But he paid the biggest price of any senator ever to run for the Senate. I don't think anybody has ever, what he did. He's a real hero, a really great person. And he's running and I hope that everybody gets out and votes for Sam Brown.\nAnd we also left behind $85 billion dollars' worth of military equipment, along with many American citizens were left behind. Many, many American citizens.\nEmboldened by that disaster, Russia invaded Ukraine. They saw this group of people that were incompetent. We took the soldiers out first, no, no. We're going to take the soldiers out second. If they would have followed my plan; we had a great plan. But the plan only kicked in if they did everything perfectly, and they weren't doing things perfectly. So we said it doesn't kick in. You know, 18 months in Afghanistan, we didn't have one — they were killing them left and right, snipers. And I spoke to the head of the Taliban. You've heard this story. Abdul, still there. Still the head of the Taliban. The press got on me, \"Why would you speak to him?\" I said, \"Because that's where the killing is.\" I don't have to speak to somebody that has nothing to do with it.\nAnd I told him: \"Don't ever do that. Don't ever do that again. Don't ever, ever do that again, you're going to stop.\" Because during the Obama administration, many great people and soldiers, a lot of soldiers, were being killed from long distance. I said, \"If you keep doing that, you're going to be hit harder than anybody has ever been hit by a country before.\" And he said, \"I understand, Your Excellency.\" He called me \"Your Excellency.\" I wonder if he calls the other guy \"Your Excellency.\" I doubt it.\nThe other guy gave him everything. I mean, what kind of a deal was that? He walked out, gave him everything. You know that right now Afghanistan is one of the largest sellers of weapons in the world? They're selling the brand-new, beautiful weapons that we gave them.\nBut think of it. He actually said to me, \"But why, but why, do you show me a picture of my home?\"\nI said, \"You'll have to ask your people or one of your wives.\"\nBut he could figure it out. And for 18 months we had not one attack on an American soldier by the Taliban. Eighteen months. And then we had that horrible day where soldiers were killed. I was not there because of a ridiculous election. But we had that horrible attack.\nAnd they also gave up Bagram, one of the biggest bases anywhere in the world, air bases, anywhere in the world. The longest runways, most powerful hardened, thickened runways.\nWe gave it up. And I liked it not because of Afghanistan, I liked it because of China. It's one hour away from where China makes their nuclear weapons. And you know who has it now? China has it now.\nWe were keeping that, and now China is likewise circling Taiwan, and Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off the coast in Cuba. Do you know that? The press refuses to write about it. If that were me running this country and we had nuclear submarines in Cuba, I will tell you that headlines every day would be \"What's Wrong With Our President?\". You don't even hear this. You're not hearing about this. Russia has nuclear submarines and warships 60 miles away, Mr. Congressman. From Miami, by the way, happens to be here. Correct? In Cuba. That would not be stood for if it were somebody else. They don't want to mention it, but now maybe they will.\nAnd to the entire world, I tell you this, we want our hostages back — and they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price.\nWith our victory in November, the years of war, weakness and chaos will be over.\nI don't have wars. I had no wars, other than ISIS, which I defeated, but that was a war that was started. We had no wars. I could stop wars with a telephone call. I could stop wars with just a telephone call. It properly stated it would never start. We will replenish our military and build an iron dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland.\nAnd this great iron dome will be built entirely in the U.S.A. We're going to build it in the U.S.A. And Wisconsin, Wisconsin, just like I gave you that massive ship contract, and you're doing a very nice job, governor, right? Thank you, governor. And they're doing a great job. In fact, I had a little design change and we gave them a tremendous for, essentially, what we used to call destroyers. These are now the most beautiful. They look like yachts.\nI said, \"We have to take the bow, and we have to make it a little nicer, and a little point at the top instead of a flat nose.\" And the people at the shipyards said, \"This guy sort of knows what he's doing.\" We had the most beautiful ships, right, governor? And everybody sitting over there? And it was a big contract that everybody wanted. I gave it to Wisconsin, but we're going to have a lot of that built right here in the state of Wisconsin and all other states.\nIsrael has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system. Three hundred forty-two missiles were shot into Israel, and only one got through a little bit. It was badly wounded, it fell to the ground, but most of them are — And Ronald Reagan wanted this many years ago, but we really didn't have the technology many years ago. Remember, they called it starship, spaceship, anything to mock him. But he was a very good president, very, very good.\nBut now we have unbelievable technology. And why should other countries have this, and we don't? No, no, we're going to build an iron dome over our country, and we're going to be sure that nothing can come and harm our people. And again, from an economic development standpoint, I'm going to make it all right here. No more sending it out to other countries in order to help. It's America first, America first.\nWe will unleash the power of American innovation, and as we do, we will soon be on the verge of finding the cures to cancer, Alzheimer's disease and many other diseases. We're going to get to the bottom of it. You remember this gentleman that I don't want to mention, other than one time I had to, because when you say \"the 10 worst,\" I had to do it. I didn't want anybody to be confused.\nBut this man said we're going to find a cure to cancer; nothing happened. We're going to get to the cure for cancer and Alzheimer's and so many other things. We're so close to doing something great. But we need a leader that will let it be done.\nWe will not have men playing in women's sports. That will end immediately.\nAnd we will restore and renovate our nation's once-great cities, making them safe, clean and beautiful again. And that includes our nation's capital, which is a horrible killing field. So many things — they leave from Wisconsin, they go to look at the Washington Monument, they end up getting stabbed, killed or shot. We will be, very soon, very proud of our capital again, Washington, D.C.\nAmerica's on the cusp of a new golden age, but we will have the courage to seize it. We're going to take it, we're going to make it a current — I mean, we're going to bring this into a golden age like never seen before. Remember this: China wants to do it, Japan wants to do it. All of these countries want to do it.\nWe have to produce massive amounts of energy. If we're going to produce the new — if you look at some of the things that have been done, and some of the things that we're going to do. But A.I. needs tremendous — literally, twice the electricity that's available now in our country, can you imagine? But instead we're spending places where they recharge electric cars.\nThey built eight chargers at a certain location, toward the Midwest. Eight chargers for $9 billion? Think of them as a tank for filling up your gas. Think of it. They spent $9 billion on eight chargers, three of which didn't work. And if you are going to do this all over our country, this crazy electric Band-Aid. If you're going to do this … And by the way, I'm all for electric. They have their application. But if somebody wants to buy a gas-powered car, gasoline-powered car, or a hybrid, they're going to be able to do it. And we're going to make that change on Day 1.\nSo, to conclude, just a few short days ago, my journey with you nearly ended. We know that. And yet, here we are tonight, all gathered together, talking about the future, promise and a total renewal of a thing we love very much. It's called America.\nWe live in a world of miracles. None of us knows God's plan, or where life's adventure will take us. I want to thank Franklin Graham for being here tonight; he's an outstanding man. He wrote me a note recently; I have a lot of respect for him. \"Sir, I love your storytelling, I think it's great, in front of these big rallies, but, sir, please do me one favor. It won't make any difference. Please. Don't use any foul language.\"\nI was a little embarrassed, I said. He said, \"It won't make any difference.\" Actually, it does, the story's not quite as good, but I've been very good. The story is not quite as good, to be honest.\nI've got to have a little talk with Franklin, but he was great. He's a great gentleman, his father was so incredible, Billy Graham. My father used to love taking me to see Billy Graham. My father would take me to see Billy Graham at Yankee Stadium. He had the biggest rallies you've ever seen. He was a good rally guy, too.\nBut he'd get up and he was a fantastic guy. My father loved Billy Graham. But I love Franklin Graham, I think Franklin's been fantastic. And I'm trying, I'm just working so hard to adhere to his note to me. I'm working hard on it, Franklin.\nBut if the events of last Saturday make anything clear, it is that every single moment we have on Earth is a gift from God. We have to make the most of every day for the people and for the country that we love.\nThe attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our movement, but the truth is, the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you. It's your movement. It's the biggest movement in the history of our country by far. It can't be stopped. It can't be stopped. It has always been about the hardworking, patriotic citizens of America.\nFor too long, our nation has settled for too little. We settled for too little. We've given everything to other nations, to other people. You have been told to lower your expectations and to accept less for your families.\nI am here tonight with the opposite message: Your expectations are not big enough. They're not big enough. It is time to start expecting and demanding the best leadership in the world, leadership that is bold, dynamic, relentless and fearless. We can do that.\nWe are Americans. Ambition is our heritage. Greatness is our birthright.\nBut as long as our energies are spent fighting each other, our destiny will remain out of reach. And that's not acceptable. We must instead take that energy and use it to realize our country's true potential — and write our own thrilling chapter of the American story. We can do it together. We will unite. We are going to come together and success will bring us together.\nIt is a story of love, sacrifice and so many other things. And remember the word: Devotion. It's unmatched devotion. Our American ancestors crossed the Delaware, survived the icy winter at Valley Forge and defeated a mighty empire to establish our cherished republic.\nThey fought so hard, they lost so many. They pushed thousands and thousands of miles across a dangerous frontier, taming the wilderness to build a life and a magnificent home for their family. They packed their families into covered wagons, trekked across hazardous trails. Scaled towering mountains and braved rivers and rapids to stake their claim on the wide-open, new and very beautiful frontier. When our way of life was threatened, American patriots marched onto the battlefield, raced into enemy strongholds and stared down death — and stared down those enemies — to keep alive the flame of freedom. At Yorktown, Gettysburg, and Midway, they joined the roll call of immortal heroes. So many — just so many heroes, so many great, great people. And we have to cherish those people. We can't forget those people. We have to cherish those people.\nAnd building monuments to those great people is a good thing, not a bad thing. They saved our country. No challenge was too much. No hardship was too great. No enemy was too fierce. Together, these patriots soldiered on and endured, and they prevailed. Because they had faith in each other, faith in their country, and above all, they had faith in their God.\nJust like our ancestors, we must now come together, rise above past differences. Any disagreements have to be put aside, and go forward united as one people, one nation, pledging allegiance to one great, beautiful — I think it's so beautiful — American flag.\nTonight, I ask for your partnership, for your support and I am humbly asking for your vote. I want your vote. We're going to make our country great again. Every day, I will strive to honor the trust you have placed in me, and I will never, ever let you down. I promise that. I will never let you down.\nTo all of the forgotten men and women who have been neglected, abandoned and left behind, you will be forgotten no longer. We will press forward, and together, we will win, win, win.\nWin, win, win, win, win, win.\nNothing will sway us. Nothing will slow us. And no one will ever stop us.\nNo matter what dangers come our way, no matter what obstacles lie in our path, we will keep striving toward our shared and glorious destiny — and we will not fail. We will not fail.\nTogether, we will save this country, we will restore the republic, and we will usher in the rich and wonderful tomorrows that our people so truly deserve.\nAmerica's future will be bigger, better, bolder, brighter, happier, stronger, freer, greater and more united than ever before.\nAnd quite simply put, we will very quickly make America great again.\nThank you very much. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you, God bless you, Wisconsin, and God bless the United States of America, our great country. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-accepting-the-presidential-nomination-the-republican-national-convention-milwaukee"}
{"Title": "Interview on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\"", "Date": "2024-10-25", "Text": "Let's go.\nSure.\nThat's right.\nYeah.\nVery.\nLast week, I did one of her last shows. I think maybe Thursday or Friday. That was a big deal being on Oprah's Show, the last one. And I was like one of the last shows in that final week and I said, \"Boy, we've come a long since that.\"\nWell, the concept, it was really like two different lives. I had a very wonderful life, but I wanted to do this. The Apprentice was still going very strong. We had 12 seasons and we had actually 14 seasons, 12 years over—They had a couple of them—\nNo, they had Arnold Schwarzenegger do it. I was involved in that and I had enough of it and we did great. It was doing great, but they wanted me to stay. They all came to see me. They said, \"We're gonna give you a contract.\" They wanted to extend my contract. Mark Burnett is a great guy. Then they wanted to extend the contract. Mark said, \"You're crazy. Don't run, don't run. Nobody gives up prime time,\" they said. It's one of those little things, which is probably true for the most—\nWell, for running against 20 some odd people. You know, turned out to be 18 professional people, mostly politicians. They said, \"Who would do this? I mean, it's a long shot.\" Actually the heads of NBC came over, Paul Telegdy, all top people came over to see me, try and talk me out of it 'cause they wanted to have me extend. The Apprentice was doing well, so it was 14 seasons, it was 12 years. We had one, two seasons where we had a double, which rarely happens. It was just a hot show, and I said, \"I want to do this.\" What happened is previously, like three years, four years before that they did a poll. They had Mitt Romney and somehow they put me in a poll and I blew everybody away. I blew him away, which isn't that hard frankly. But I blew everybody away and I said, \"That's interesting, 'cause I never really gave it that much real thought.\"\nI thought about it, but never real thought. But I saw these polls were very good and so I was thinking about doing it then, but I had a contract with The Apprentice, plus I was building two big buildings at the time and I wanted to make sure they got finished up properly and it was one of those things. The kids were just sort of getting involved. They're very capable kids, but they were getting involved early on. So I did that. I got them done. I had some very good successes and I came on and then I thought about it for the next one after the Romney disaster and I ran, and I won against Hillary and it was quite an experience, but it was a different life because you're right, The Vies, I was on The Vies many, many times and they loved me.\nAnd they support me now. Bill Ackman—\n—supports me.\nHe's been very supportive too.\nDo you mean in office or when I decided to run?\nOh, when I was.\nSo when I was in and won and was in The White House essentially.\nWell, first of all it was very surreal. It's very interesting. When I got shot, it wasn't surreal. That should have been surreal. When I was laying on the ground, I knew exactly what was going on. I knew exactly where I was hit. They were saying you were hit all over the place because there was so much blood from the ear. You would know that better than anyone. When they get the ear torn up, it's a—\nAnyway. So, and I was thinking the other day—when that happened, I really knew where I was. I knew exactly what happened. I said, I wasn't hit anywhere else. With the presidency, it was a very surreal experience, okay.\nYeah, that's what happened. So I'm driving down Pennsylvania Avenue. I had just built a building on Pennsyl—you know, the hotel, the old post office it was. We called it Trump National Hotel and we sold it to the Waldorf Astoria, and it was a wonderful thing. But I'm driving down, I'm passing the hotel. You've never seen so many motorcycles, police, military, you know, it was a major thing. I got off, really the first time I used Air Force One, landed and we're coming down and it was very beauti—I mean, it was incredible. And we're going down Pennsylvania Avenue in the opposite direction. Normally you're used to going one way and all of a sudden you're going the other way. The street was loaded up and I wanted to go out and I wanted to wave to everybody, but that wasn't smart. You know, the kids, little bit dangerous when you watch like Kennedy and some others, but I really felt, I don't know, the love was so crazy.\nAnd so I did get out of the car for a brief, you know, just for a very short walk. I thought it was very important to do. And Melania got out with a beautiful dress on that became sort of a staple. It was, uh, people loved it and Barron and we're walking down the street. But where it really got amazing, we get to The White House and now it's a little bit before dark, beautiful. And we went up to the President's quarters, they call them the Presidential quarters and I'm standing in this beautiful hallway. It's funny. Nobody ever talks about The White House as being beautiful inside. You think it's all, everything's gonna all metal doors and stuff. It's not. It's so beautiful. I made my money largely on luxury. The hallway is like 25 feet wide. The ceiling heights are, everythin—It's so beautiful. But I was standing there and I said to the guys, \"I want to see the Lincoln bedroom.\"\nI had never seen the Lincoln bedroom. I'd heard about the Lincoln bedroom. And I was standing with my wife. I said, \"Do you believe it? This is the Lincoln bedroom.\" I mean, it was, like, it was amazing because it's, look, if you love the country, but here you are, the Lincoln bedroom. And the bed, you know he was very tall. He was six foot six, which then would be like, like Barron. Would be like Barron Trump. He's 6'9, but six foot six, he was very tall. Then on top of that, he wore—\n—that. Yeah, there it is. It's a long bed, elongated bed. And because people were shorter then. You see, some of the chairs are very, very low to the ground actually. But he had the long bed and they had, uh you had the Gettysburg Address right on that, right under that. You can't see it here, but right there, the original version of the Gettysburg Address, and this is the original, and I'm looking and I just looked around. I said, \"Do you believe this?\" Because I was never a pol—First of all, even if you were a politician. But I was never a politician. I sort of just started, right.\nAnd all of a sudden I'm standing in The White House. And it was uh, very very surreal. That room was so beautiful to me, much more beautiful than it actually is. You know, to me, when I looked at the bed, and the bed, you could see it was a little bit longer, had to be a little bit longer. Uh, he lost his son and the two of them suffered from melancholia. They didn't call it depression, they called it melancholia and they suffered from it. He was a very depressed guy and she was a very depressed woman, more so than him. And on top of that, they lost their son whose name was Tad. Tad. And uh, and just seeing it, and the little picture. There's a little tiny picture.\nI mean, you can't see the details there, little, tiny—everything the way it was—a little tiny picture of Tad who he lost, and it was devastating. And he was in a war and he was having a hard time because he couldn't beat Robert E. Lee. Robert E. Lee won like 13 battles in a row. And he was getting a phobia, like a fighter. You know a lot about the fight stuff, but like I went to a UFC fight and it was a champion who was 14 and 1 about a year ago, you would know the names, 14 and 1, and the only guy he lost to was this one guy. But the guy that he was fighting was like, almost just an average fighter. He lost numerous times, but he beat this one guy. So I said, \"Okay-\"\nI will figure it out.\nBut about a year ago—But the point is that he lost. He wasn't nearly the fighter as the one—But the one who was not nearly the fighter had beaten, he's the only guy that beat the champ like five years before. And then he said, \"I'll take the guy that won the other fight.\" And that's what happened. He beat him a second time.\nYeah. What is this crazy thing? Lincoln had a—uh, I don't know, I've never read this. I heard it from people in The White House who really understand what was going on with the whole life of The White House. But Lincoln had the yips, about, in a way, as the golfers would say. He had a phobia about Robert E. Lee. He said, \"I can't beat Robert,\" because Robert E. Lee won many battles in a row. He was just beating the hell out of—They tried to get Robert E. Lee to be on the North, but he said, \"No, I have to be with my state.\"\nThe state was his whole thing and he went to the South. And, he was, uh I've had generals tell me—We have some great generals. The real generals, not the ones you see on television. The ones that beat Isis, with me. We defeated Isis in record time. It was supposed to take years and we did it in a matter of weeks. These are great generals. These are tough guys. These are not woke guys. But their favorite general in terms of genius was Robert E. Lee. He took a war—\nStrategically. He took a war that should have been over in a few days and it was, you know, years of hell, a vicious war. And so here I am standing there, and again, I had never really done this before. I ran, I ran a number of months before I won. I probably, uh, I guess if you figured, max it out, it would be a year, something like that. So I had never run for office. And I did well. I mean I, I went into debates. We had 18 people including me, and then slowly but surely they started to disappear. We had debates, good debates.\nYeah.\nPrivate stuff.\nYeah.\nThe biggest thing was just that first moment of being in this hallowed—It was really a hallowed place to me. It was—\n—beyond—To me, that was the experience. It was a surreal experience. And then with time that wears off. With time, it becomes your place where you stay.\nAnd I was doing a lot of—I had two things that I really focused on, governing the country and survival. Because from the moment I won, before I got to office, all of a sudden—I mean, they came down. I mean, nobody has ever been treated that way. And, and you see that, I mean, you see we're in The Washington Post very early on. They said, \"Well now the impeachment stuff starts.\" And it did. I mean it literally started from the beginning. So I had survival and run the nation. I had a combination. Most people don't have the survival, they get in.\nYou have actually 10,000 appointments. Now, they're different. You have big ones and then they appoint 100 people and 200 people. But the President really is involved with approximately 10,000 appointments. So you'll appoint a Secretary of State and he, he or she will appoint a lot of people. So it's a lot. But in terms of major ones, you probably have like 100, but they're big ones. Treasury, State, military.\nWell, I didn't. I had no experience—\nI was there 17 times in Washington and I never stayed over. According to the press, which I think is probably right. Over the years I was only there 17 times. I never stayed over. So now I'm sitting there, I'm saying, \"This place is gorgeous, but, you know, I don't know anybody.\" It's like you, you go to certain areas and other areas, they may be great. Washington was great. Washington's not so great now, we got to fix it, we're gonna make it better. A very dangerous place, very badly maintained place. We're gonna make it great. We're gonna make it better. We're gonna bring it back. But I wasn't a Washington guy. I was a New York guy. I was a New York builder and I built buildings in New York and I knew that whole world, but I didn't know the Washington world too well. And all of a sudden you're supposed to be appointing top people. So—\nWell, I was always involved in politics, but usually from the standpoint of a donor.\nI was a donor. I was a big donor. I gave money to politicians. I enjoyed politicians—\nBoth, really. Pretty much both. I have actually pictures of Ronald Reagan and me when I was very young.\nI was a Democrat, um, I could get you the exact, but the early nineties. The early nineties. I switched over eventually. Actually they had a Reform Party. I was thinking about doing that for a little while, but then fortunately I didn't because it's very hard. You know, it's a two-party system. And anytime you hear third party, I know you like RFK Jr. and so do I, he's a fantastic guy.\nBut that whole thing is very tough.\nIt doesn't work because even if you do great, you're not gonna get Congress. In other words, you need now to say, \"Okay, now I'll get half of Congress.\" They're never gonna vote for you. So even if you got there, which is very hard, and I know how you feel about Bobby and I feel the same way, and he's now with us. But doesn't w—it's pure and simple. It's a two-party system. And somebody, I won't mention his name, but somebody spent $250 million trying to get the nomination as a Reform Party candidate or whatever, and they got just nowhere. You get eaten, just get eaten. The system eats you alive.\nSo, uh, it was really somebody that not only was new to Washington, but was new to politics. So in the office of the presidency, over the years, all those Presidents you've had 92% were politicians and 8% were Generals, General Eisenhower, General Washington, right. General George Washington. You had Generals. So it's 8% Generals, no Admirals. 8% Generals and 92% politicians. You know, they're politicians and they go on. So they never had a business guy or they never had a guy that wasn't elected to an office. They were all, like, Ronald Reagan was really, he was a movie actor, but he became the Governor of California for, I think, two terms, and then he ran. So you'd never had a thing like this. But I uh, in terms of me, and sometimes I'd use it as an excuse, and I don't like having excuses actually, but I'd use it as an excuse. I had to rely on people that I respected or liked, but that I didn't know that well because I didn't know them that well.\nSome of those people I campaigned against 'cause when you have 18 people, we had mostly politicians running in the election, you know, running in the primaries, and they got knocked out one by one. But I got to like some of them, some of them I didn't like at all. I don't like them now. And I'd rely on them and I'd rely on other people. So all of a sudden people would come in, I'd like to recommend so-and-so to be Secretary of State, and I'd have three, four people recommend—One thing I can tell you, Joe, everybody wants the position.\nNo, no. But sometimes they'll hear, \"A lot of people don't want to work with Trump because Trump is tough to work with, et cetera.\" Let me tell you, everybody wants to be any one of these positions. They'd die for it.\nNow they don't want to be known. I mean, there's a particular guy in New York, primarily. Very big, very big, very successful, very strong, very political, although he is not a politician. He'd give anything to be Secretary of State. But if they ask him, \"No, I don't think I would do it.\" But in the meantime, begging for it. Okay, begging.\nLook, everybody wants it.\nAnd by the way, no matter what you do—But it's very dangerous to pick somebody outside of a politician because a politician has been basically vetted for years. You pick a business guy and they've never been vetted at all, and they're you know, the head of a big company or something, but they've never been vetted, you know nothing about his personal life, you know nothing about where he's been. When you put him in, it's a little bit dangerous because all of a sudden they get checked up and you hear things that you say, \"Wow, this is not gonna work out too well.\" So it's very dangerous. Picking people that are outside of politics is somewhat dangerous.\nAnd they're stiffs in many cases.\nStiffs. They're survivors. I find that uh, you know—\nA stiff. They don't have—They have nothing. Or they're smart and survivor—One little thing. So there was a congressman years before I ran, and I was very close to him and I needed a license on something and he was very important in getting the license. But it was a little bit controversial, the license, this particular thing that was being licensed. But I was close to this guy and helped him and everything else, and I went to him. I said, \"I'd like to have you help.\" And he said, \"Let me take a look at it.\" I said, \"Ooh, that's not too good, but I really hope you're gonna help.\" Anyway, he tapped me along for a long period of time and ultimately didn't do it. And I said, \"You are a stiff. You could have done this thing so easy,\" et cetera. But it was controversial. He was in Congress for many years, like 28 years. And, you know, there's a reason when somebody's there for 28 years, you got to be sort of smart.\nYou have all the scandals. And I realized he was a survivor.\nYeah, yeah.\nAnd yet I don't disrespect him for it. I actually respected the guy more in a certain way. I said—\n—\"You know what, he's been there for 28 years and he made it through.\" A lot of people don't make it through. They don't last long.\"\nWell, it is. It certainly is.\nOh, yeah. I think—so the one question that you'll ask me, that I think you'll ask me that people seem to ask, and I always come up with the same answer. Ahh, if—the one mistake, 'cause I had a lot of success, great economy, great everything. Everything was great. The military, we rebuilt it. Biggest tax cuts in history, all the stuff we did—We had a great presidency. Three Supreme Court justices. Most people get none. You know, you pick them young, this way they're there for 50 years, right.\nSo, even if a President is there for eight years, oftentimes they never have a chance. I had three. It was sort of the luck of the draw, but I will say that it always comes back to the same answer. The biggest mistake I made was I picked some people. I picked some great people, you know, but you don't think about that. I picked some people that I shouldn't have picked. I picked a few people that I shouldn't have picked and—\nYeah, I mean, look, you're reading about them a little bit today, A guy like Kelly who was a bully, a bully but a weak person. You know more about bullies than anybody probably around 'cause you deal in a certain sport where the bullies are exposed very quickly. But, you know, he's bad. Bolton was an idiot, but he was great for me because I'd go in with a guy like a John Bolton. You know John Bolton?\nA friend of mine called me up. I was picking Bolton, and he's a very smart guy. His name is Phil Ruffin. He's a very rich guy from Las Vegas. One of the—he's a great card player. He doesn't play cards, but he's a great play—He's just a natural, got poker sense, right. The good old poker sense. And Phil Ruffin is a very, very wise kind of a guy and very, one of the richest people around, and has had great success and understands people, so, it was in that I was picking Bolton or I picked Bolton, he called up, he said, \"Don't pick him.\" \"Why?\" \"He's a bad guy.\" Now, he wasn't in politics at all. He's in various businesses. He said, \"He's a bad guy. He's just—It always works out bad with that guy.\"\nI said, \"Oh man, I wish you told me this two weeks ago. I already hired him. He's here.\" And, and he was right. But he was good in a certain way. He's a nut job. And every time I had to deal with a country, when they saw this whack job standing behind me, they said, \"Oh man, Trump's gonna go to war with us. He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East, they shoulda never done it. I used to say it as a civilian. So I always got more publicity than other people. And it wasn't like I was trying. In fact, I don't know exactly why. Maybe you can tell me why.\nMaybe. Maybe I did.\nMaybe that's it.\nYeah, yeah.\nYeah.\nIt's funny, you need at least the attitude of a comedian when you're doing this business. This is a very dangerous business first of all. It's a very tough business. When—\nYeah. It's the most—well, for a job?\nIt's the most dangerous. Being President is the most dangerous—\nYeah, they'd rather not talk about them.\nBut I think he's in good shape because it's only consequential Presidents. If you take a look at what's happened, look, I'm for having countries pay us billions and billions and trillions even, dollars. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Nobody took in 10 cents. Not one other President. I do things that make it, I mean don't necessarily make me so popular. I just do what's right. And when you do that, you know, you're more—Look at Iran. Iran—we would've never had the attack on Israel at all. Iran was broke. I told China, \"If you buy, you can't do business in the United States under any circum—\" We we're gonna go cold Turkey with China. Some people think that would've been a good idea anyway. But, \"If you buy any oil, one barrel of oil from them, you're not doing business.\" I said that to many countries. Iran was broke. They had no money for Hezbollah. They had no money for Hamas. They had no mon—But I make myself—you know, I mean, I understand what I'm doing. You make yourself a target and it's a very dangerous business. But, if you just look at statistically, so I, I sort of think, I don't know if it's right, but one-tenth of 1% for a race car driver, it's a pretty dangerous business, right.\nOne tenth of 1% for a bull rider. I tell you to me, I—\nThese guys that ride the bulls is worse than UFC.\nThese guys. You see these big monster bulls and you see it in slow motion where the foot is like an inch away from the head. If it hits them, the guy's gone. But they die. They die.\nYeah, yeah. One tenth of 1% die.\nAnd they certainly get hurt badly. Really, I mean, they can't walk after a certain period of time. But with a President, if you look at the assassination—\n—and attempts too. And attempts. No, it's a very dangerous position. I never thought of that, by the way, when I did it. You know, you don't tend to—I don't think of—\nWell, I think it would be so easy. You know, it was very interesting—\n\"Oh, he loves Robert E. Lee.\" That's right. \"He loves Robert E. Lee.\"\nWell, they don't even have to take them out. They make them up entirely.\nBut you know, it's interesting when you mentioned—I was very popular and, and all those people love me. I mean, this uh, some of these women, they're, they're so stupid—And Joy, she would, every time she'd see me, I'd be in the theater or something and she goes, \"You have to be on the show again. Come on, come on, let's go. We have to.\"\nLoved me.\nIt's okay.\nBut Whoopi loved me.\nWhoopi loved me.\nAnd how about that other one, the new one on there, the one from my Administration? She writes me a letter, \"You're the greatest President.\" She leaves. She worked as an Assistant Press Secretary. I hardly knew her, but she leaves and she writes me this gorgeous letter. What's her name? She was—I don't even know. You know, anyway, she was in the Administration, she's on now currently, sits in the far right-hand side, whatever the hell her name is, and she writes a letter, the most beautiful letter—she's quoted in the paper, \"He's a consequential, he was the greatest President, ba, ba, ba.\" Then all of a sudden she goes on The View, she started hitting the hell out of me because they won't hire her unless. I've had many people go on CNN and they called and said, \"I don't know what to do. They want to pay me a lot, but I have to be negative on you.\" I said, \"Be negative. That's okay.\" There were guys on like CNN, they won't hire them. Sean Duffy is a, you know, congressman and he retired. He got a good job with CNN, but he was only positive about Trump. So they kept him, but they would never put him on. I mean, I respect what he did. He could have gone, you know, negative. I tell people, go negative. Let my friends make the money. It's so crooked. The press is so crooked.\nThey're hurting themselves.\nThe worst I've ever seen though, and I've seen the worst. I mean, I've been a part of it. I've been—I've seen the worst. Kamala goes on 60 Minutes, gave an answer that a child wouldn't give. It was so bad. And 60 Minutes took the answer out. They took the whole and they put another answer in—\n—which didn't make sense either, but it was better. They took the—Well, it wasn't editing, it was fraud. This was not editing. Editing is where I'll give an answer and they'll take a couple of words and change it around. Or they might even take a sentence or two off, which is very bad, but, that, it's sort of bad. I'd give an answer, which was a very good answer. I always talk about, you know, I like to give along the weave. I like to—\nYeah. But when you do the weaves, and you have to be very smart to do weaves, when you do the weave—look at this. Just in this one thing we're talking about little pieces [inaudible] but it always ends up—\nNo, no. It comes back home for the right people. For the wrong people, it doesn't come back home and they end up in the wilderness, right? But, but they can take my answer. And you know what? They may take a little piece of it out or something and they use the term, yes, we want to save time. Well, it's not it but I've never heard—I think it's the biggest scandal in broadcast history what happened to CNS—CBS. So you have CBS 60 Minutes. That's a news program. It's not an entertainment program. It's under their news. It's the head of their news thing. She gives an answer that was, that shows that she's essentially incompetent and they took the answer. Could you imagine them doing that for me?\nGo ahead, sure.\nI'll indemnify.\nSomebody made a big mistake.\nSome kid put the preview out.\nAnd then the bosses did this or that and then all of a sudden said, \"We got a problem.\"\nThey got caught by mistake. But don't you think that's a—To me, and don't forget, this is election interference and fraud and it's 60 Minutes. It's their news division. So—\nThey give those licenses out, Joe, for free. They should pay a fortune. They're worth a fortune. They give them out for free because they're using the public airwaves. With cable, you don't have that. Cable's different, but, you know, it's just a different deal. But with the networks, they give those license. They're worth billions of dollars. They give them out free but you have to be honest and all, that was bad.\nI think that David Muir and that woman that was aside, I never even heard of her, but they kept interrupting me. It was like I said, \"How many people am I debating here? I got this one and I got you two.\" But he went after me 11 different times. You know, it's interesting. I always thought he was a nice guy, but he's just like the rest of them, you know?\nNo, but not when they're wrong.\nNot at and all.\nToo many.\nStupidly deployed.\nWell, Joe, when I said crime is soaring, he said, \"No, no crime has gone down.\" I said, \"Where did you hear that one, crime has gone down?\" I mean, I'm debating with this guy, but I've had that.\nAnd by the way, the statistics were fraud because when they put out the statistics, they didn't include some of the worst places. They didn't include some of the worst cities, some of the most deadly places.\nBut when the real numbers came out, I turned out to be right. But I haven't gotten—\nSo bad. So bad.\nIt's so sad what's happened. And I'll tell you what. I go to police funerals. And we went to one in Long Island. I visited the family in Long Island. A very big deal. It's so dangerous. People don't realize—the car, dark windows, pull over. He's a gentleman. \"Please pull over.\" Door opens. Guy comes out firing. Even if they were allowed to pull out their gun, which they're not, they can't pull out the—\nThey still wouldn't have time.\nThey open a door and he was killed and his partner was hurt. He was killed. And you don't, I mean, you don't even have an eighth of a second to think. And it is such a dangerous job. That in particular, think of it. You go up to a car. You don't know who's sitting there with a gun. And if they have a gun, you really don't have a chance. You're not allowed to have your gun out, by the way. There're very strict rules.\nSo, number one, they're in it. But even if you could have your gun out, the door opens and a guy and bullets start firing out, and especially where they have the dark windows, darkened windows. It is such a dangerous profession. And it's very hard to get cops now because they're not given any backup. And you're right. You know, they have like an eighth of a second to make a decision that's gonna change their life. If they make the wrong decision, they're gonna end up on the front page of every newspaper in the country and they're gonna lose their house and their pension and their job and their wife is gonna be gone and everything is gonna be gone.\nBut we have to give them back their dignity. We have to, we can't—we just have to give them back—You said it so good. You never hear anybody say that—You're never gonna have it perfect, you're gonna have a bad apple.\nBut every time there's a bad apple, that gets massive publicity and it, it taints everybody also.\nRight. She was uh, a big part of defund the police. That was a big thing for her, defund the police, always defund the police.\nYeah. But anybody with that political thought, I don't think should be running for President. And I think people are getting wise to it. you know, We're doing pretty well now. I don't know. Maybe in a week from now, say sorry about that. I was wrong.\nBut we're leading everything. And I think we're gonna have a very good election. But I tell people—because people are starting to get to know her. But she was defund the police. She was all these trans-gender operations. If you wanted a sex change and you were in detention and you demanded a sex change, they would give you a sex change.\nThat's right, in detention.\nThat's right. But she was in favor of it.\nSo, so, think of it. Now she changed. She's changed 15 policies. In fact, I'm gonna send her a MAGA cap.\nI came up with this idea that honestly, nobody ever heard of. And now it took her two months. But you know what? All of us—\nAnd she just put it into a little speech.\nWell, I think we still have that issue. I think that issue is a good one for us. And then we have a lot of good issues. you know, We had the other day. Think of how simple some of these things are. We're trying to get cars built in the United States. Detroit has been really tough. It's been a disaster. They have a huge factory, a huge car auto plant being built by China in Mexico. Make cars, sell them in the United States, put everybody out of business. Here we go again.\nI said, \"If that plant is there when I'm President, I will put 100 or 200 percent tariffs on every car.\" They'll be unsellable in the United States. And they just announced they're not gonna build the plant because they think I'm gonna win. Think of it. They're not gonna build the plant. This was their biggest plant in the world. More than all of Michigan makes. That's how big. you know, This is what we're getting to. And I said, \"If that plan goes up, I want them to understand if I win, I'm gonna tax those cars at the rate of 100 or 200 percent apiece so that you won't be able to sell them in the United States.\" They just announced they're not gonna build the plant.\nAnd they did a big favor for our country by doing that. And I'm not even there yet. To me, the most beautiful word, and I've said this for the last couple of weeks, in the dictionary today, and any, is the word tariff. It's more beautiful than love. It's more beautiful than anything. It's the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use of tariffs. It will keep—\nWell, okay.\nYeah, sure, why not? Because we—Ready? Our country was the richest in the, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s. A President who was assassinated named McKinley, he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful. uh, \"We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price.\"\nAnd the big price is tariffs. And he'd speak like that. But he was right. And then around, in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to, frankly, an income tax. And you know why? Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America. \"We don't want to pay tariffs. Please don't.\" you know, Believe me. They control our politicians. If you look at the kind of numbers that these guys make, then and now. But we had a commission meeting in the uh, I think it was 1887.\nThink of this problem. We were so rich. We had so much money. We didn't know what to do. So they set up a blue ribbon commission on tariffs. And the sole purpose is what to do with all the money we had. We were so rich because we were taxing other people for coming in and taking our jobs. And China does it. That's what China did. If you want to open a factory and sell cars, if you build a factory here or have a factory, they don't take our cars. They wouldn't take our cars. But if you build a plant in China, you can do that. Elon did that. By the way, Elon is great. That guy is such a great guy. I think you're a fan of Elon.\nHe is from a different planet. He's the greatest guy. That rocket coming in. I'm, I'm, I told the story once or twice, so you may have heard it because his speeches have been good. Did you see the one last night?\n29,000 people. That was it. And the one the night before was the same thing. We are, we are rocking and rolling. But Elon, and I'm talking to this very important guy, I said, \"Wait a minute, I'm looking at something.\" The television's unmuted, right/\nAnd I see this rocket. It's all brown from the heat, you know, 10,000 degrees pouring down at thousands of miles an hour. And I see this thing. you know, It's like a 20-story building.\nAnd I say to this guy, he's an important guy, \"Wait a minute. uh, Let me just put you to hold. I got to see this.\" And I see this and, and it's gonna crash. I said, \"It's gonna crash into the gantry.\" They call it a gantry. I said, \"Oh man, that's gonna be a disaster\" because it's starting to get very close. And then all of a sudden you see the flames in the bottom, rrrrr and then boom. And then you see the two arms grab it.\nAnd I forgot the guy. I had him on the phone. I forgot. No, I said, \"The hell with it.\" No, I called Elon. I said, \"Was that you?\" He said, \"That was me.\" And I said, \"Who else can do that?\" He said, \"Nobody. Russia can't do it. The United States. Nobody can do it.\"\nYou know, I set up Space Force. That was me. And that's the first time in 82 years that we opened another branch since the Air Force. And that's gonna be one of our most important things. But think of what Elon does. And he did one other thing that I never heard of it. It's uh, Starlink. I went down to North Carolina, Georgia, the different places, right?\nI followed it right down. And they had no communication. The poles were all knocked down. Every—and one of the guys in North Carolina said, \"Could you do me a favor? Do you know Elon Musk?\" \"Yes. He endorsed me.\" By the way, he gave me the nicest endorsement, to the tough—he said, \"The country is gonna fail and you should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala.\" Kamala. You're not a Kamala person. I know you. I've watched you. I know him better than he is. You know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife. I have watched you for so many years. You're not a Kamala person. You're a Khabib person, but you're not a Kamala person. Nobody's gonna know who Khabib is. [Khabib Nurmagomedov, mixed martial arts fighter]\nBut he was not bad, right?\nBut that's your kind of person.\nNo, no. My weave but is it much better?\nBut wait. One second. Before we finish with tariffs. So they said, they said, \"Could you get him? We need Starlink.\" And I called Elon. He got it for him so fast, saved so many lives. And I said, \"How was it?\" They said, \"Better than the wires.\" You know, they couldn't put them in. They were all gone. So getting back to tariffs.\nThat's great. Did you find it good?\nWe're spending—Just to show you. We're spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right? Up to upstate areas where you have, like, two farms and they're spending millions of dollars to advocate. Elon can do it for nothing.\nThey haven't hooked up one person yet.\nThat's right.\nFor almost nothing.\nFor a monthly charge.\nAnd he wanted to do that.\nHow about this? They built uh, the charger stations, right? In the Midwist—in the Midwest. They built eight of them. They cost $9 billion. That's like a gas pump, right? They built nine gas pumps, except electricity comes out. They spent $9 billion. Three of them don't work. The whole thing. There's so much waste. I could, I could sit here and tell you about things that, that there's so much waste, abuse, and fraud.\nLikes get back to tariffs.\nYeah.\nOkay. We were ready to rock. It was all—You know, I had a bad system. We had horrible tax policy. I made it great. With a much lower tax rate. So I took it from almost 40% down to 21%. Now I'm bringing it from 21% down to 15%. But only if you make your product in the United States, which is great. People call me. They said, \"What a great idea.\" Nobody ever heard of that before. I don't care if they make the product in Japan. Why should I give up? So it's a 21.\nThat—at 21, in the first year, we took in much more revenue than we did at almost 40. Think of that. It inspired—Now we had other things, too. We were able to get people to bring back their money. You couldn't—you couldn't bring back your money. If you had money in Europe, like Apple, Apple had many billions of dollars outside. They couldn't bring it. There was no way to bring it back in. uh, The bureaucracy, the documents, the whole thing. And also the tax was too high. They wanted like half of it or something.\nNobody's gonna do that. So they leave their money in Japan and they spend their money there. That was part of what I did. The money came pouring back in. Apple took in hundreds of billions of dollars. They brought it back from overseas. They brought it in.\nSo what happened is this. We were ready to rock and roll. And then we had the COVID thing and we had to focus on that. And if we didn't give some businesses a hand, they would have all—you would have had a depression like in 1929. But we were ready to start. We were going to—we would have very shortly been paying off debt.\nYou know, we have $35 trillion in debt. And I'll never forget it. We were—it was talking about from, you know, the standpoint of being in office. I'm in the Oval Office and I have John McLaughlin and Fabrizio, the two very good pollsters probably. I don't know. I would say the two best. Who knows? But very good pollsters. And we're starting to think about running for a second term. And we had the greatest economy in history. Never has there been an economy like that.\nYeah. A lot of—Two things. And also, I cut regulations more than anybody else. And if—I asked many of the businessmen, you know, from the big companies, you know, the guys running the big companies, I'd say, \"So if you had your choice, you've had it now for a long time. What's more important to you? The tax cuts, you paid less tax, or the regulation cuts?\" Every one of them said the regulation cuts meant more.\nWho would think that? Right? Because you don't equate it to dollars, but it actually is more dollars. uh, We had it going and then we just hadta focus on something else. But they were sitting—\nThese two pollsters were sitting there and they said, \"Sir, if George Washington came back and Abraham Lincoln was his VP, as opposed to Walz,\" how bad is he, by the way? But if Abraham Lincoln was his VP, they couldn't beat you. You have a—and I'll never forget it. The following day, they said, \"Something's happening in China, sir. Could we meet?\" I said, \"What's happening?\" \"People are dying.\" And it was all around the Wuhan lab, by the way. There are pictures with little lines, they're body bags, all around the Wuhan lab. And I always said that from the beginning, Joe, was, you know, they tried to say, first they said it was France and you know, they blamed everybody.\nBut then they say it was bats from a cave 2,000 miles away. So we got hit with that. And despite that, we had the best economy. And when I gave it over, the stock market was higher than it was pre-COVID. I mean, nobody could even believe it. But we saved it. And we were helping businesses. They were dying. You know, they were dying.\nIf we didn't have COVID, we would have been paying off debt. And we would have had—and don't forget, by growth, the word growth is actually more important in a way, because you could have the same debt. But if you doubled your growth, all of a sudden you're under levered. But still, we should pay off debt. You know, if you viewed this uh, $35 trillion right now, it's a lot.\nBut if you look at the asset value, if you looked at it purely as an asset value, we have oil underground, we have water, we have mountains, we have—I mean, the assets are so enormous. But regardless of that, we've got $35 trillion in debt, we should pay it off. And we would've started paying off debt and probably even giving further, given further tax reductions.\nI want to get it down to 15%. We're gonna do more business. But when you get hit with a COVID, everything stops, and you have to keep these businesses alive. The businesses were dying. I mean, they were just dying. This whole place, this country was gonna die.\nYeah, no.\nYeah. Yeah.\nSo the environmental is the biggest tool for stopping growth, the biggest tool. The other is regulation. And if you speak to Elon, he said the regulation now to send a rocket up to anywhere, even if you do everything, it's almost, it's becoming impossible. But they use environmental in order to get people not to do anything. And sometimes I say, you know, I look at some of the, I know the environmental stuff better because I had to build buildings in New York.\nI had to build, I had to do environmental impact studies. And I would see some of these guys that I'd hire for a lot of money, environmentalists that would get you through the process. And they'd be up in Albany, that's the capital of New York, and they're up there trying to make it tougher for guys like me that were builders because they'd get paid more money. In other words, I, I had one guy, uh, highly recommended, all, you know, I was good at getting permits. I was one of the kings of, I was always very good. But the environmental stuff was always horrible. They could slow a project down 10 years, 15 years. I had a project in Louisiana, built—big LNG plant. It was, uh, for 14 years, it was gonna cost $18 million—$18 billion, one of the biggest, like the Empire State Building, laying down on its side, times four, massive, on the coast, on the Gulf Coast. And they said, \"Sir, they're gonna give it up.\" I said, \"They shouldn't give it up. What's the problem?\".\n\"They can't get their environmental.\" They had environmental permits that would fill this whole room up to the ceiling. And they said there was one mistake on one little line, they wanted 'em do it all over again. I said, \"It's not gonna happen.\" And I got them their permit instantly. And they built the plant, it's massive.\nThe weapon.\n—consultants and lawyers.\nAbsolutely.\nThey make the process worst.\nAnd I'd probably do the same thing if I were them, to be honest with you, you know?\nI want to be honest with you.\nThey go, let's say New York, they go to Albany.\nAnd they convince people that if you have a certain type of plant on the ground that's this big, and in theory valueless, that it's a rare plant, and you cannot ever—even touch it, you can't go near it, you can't put a building on it, you can't do anything. Or there's a little puddle, and they call it a lake, and you have to go by the standards of a lake. I said, \"No, no, that's a puddle.\" Oh, you have no idea. Guys are filling a little puddle. You have no idea what they do. And they use it as a way to stop you.\nIt's a weapon.\nWell, they get fees.\nMassive fees. And you pay these guys.\nYeah, but some of them are just bad guys, and they're trying to make it more and more difficult.\nYeah, ah, I, I think they maybe had more. They didn't have as much with me, because I would get through them, and I understood it. Look, I've had, I've done so many, they call it environmental impact study. I did so much. To build a building. To build a building in New York is very tough. You've got to deal with, think of it, financing, unions, uh, all the municipal stuff, environmental. Of all of it, to me, the toughest thing was the environmental, because they could stop you cold with the environmental impact study stuff. And, and you hire a so-called expert, and they say, \"Sir, he's the one guy who can get you through the morass.\" It's a morass. It's horrible. They use it as a weapon. They use it all over the country.\nThere are. There are but.\nSure.\nSure, yeah.\nYou do. You do. Look, I had—during our four years, we had the cleanest air and the cleanest water. I view it differently. I say air and water. Remember this. It costs much more to do things environmentally clean. China doesn't do anything.\nBut let me just tell you, though, so here we are cleaning and scrubbing everything and everything's got to—and the air's got to be pure. But in 3.8 days, that stuff floating over China is right over the top of us.\nSame thing with the oceans. They dump their garbage into the Pacific Ocean. If you take a little cork and put it there, in about a week and a half, it'll be in front of Los Angeles. We're picking up their garbage. So, nobody ever talks about that. But in a way, the bigger one is even—the air. It's the currents. It's an amazing thing. It's been flowing that way for a million years, long before we were there.\nNo. If we're cleaning—\nAbsolutely.\nBut we get the China, uh, you know, they call it the China curse. We get the China curse, they're bad, and their air is dirty. You know, when I went there, uh, I had a great relationship with President Xi. We got along very well. And they treated me better than anybody's ever been treated. Same thing with Saudi Arabia, a number of them. But they laid it out. And I said, \"This air is good.\" Do you know, they closed every factory one week before I got there, from within 200 miles.\nHe cleaned it up.\nIsn't that terrible in a way? To think, you know, he cleaned it up, and then it became a pigsty.\nCan you imagine?\nAnd the day he left.\nIt went right back.\nBut in a way, that was a bad thing that he did. Because he showed—\nWhat a disgrace that was. What a disgrace.\nBut let me give you one that you may not know, which I think you know everything, actually.\nAs a student of yours. But water. you know, In—\n—Los Angeles, you can't get proper amounts of water and it's unbelievably expensive, and you might have a house in Beverly Hills, and they're actually thinking about rationing water. Can you believe it?\nI was, I was in the farm country with some of the congressmen. We're driving up a highway and I say, \"How come all this land is so barren?\" It's farmland and it looked terrible. It was just brown and bad. I said, \"But there's always that little corner that's so green and beautiful.\" They said, \"We have no water.\" I said, \"Do you have a drought?\" \"No, we don't have a drought.\" I said, \"Why don't you have no water?\" Because the water isn't allowed to flow down. It's got a natural flow from Canada all the way up north of water, more water than they could ever use. And in order to protect a tiny little fish, the water up north gets routed into the Pacific Ocean. Millions and millions of gallons of water gets poured.\nYou gotta see this. We're driving up and I had never seen it before. It's the most—it's like Iowa. It's the most fertile land. Iowa's blessed with great land. Idaho for a potato, right?\nBut, they're just—by the way, some land is good for a potato. Some land is good for corn. It's the craziest thing. I love the farmers. They're great. They're the greatest. And by the way, they're getting killed right now.\nThey're getting killed because of this stupid Administration. But, so I see this and I said, \"You got to be kidding.\" I said, \"You mean you have water?\" And I looked at it, it's like a valve in your sink, except it's massive. The thing's five times taller than your ceiling.\nThey have so much water.\nNo, I never saw that. No.\nSo they dumped it into the Pacific.\nThink of those dry forests that burned down all over. You know, the head of Austria said—\nThat's a great system.\nYeah.\nWhat a beautiful thing.\nThat'd be much more valuable property.\nNo, they let it go into the Pacific and then they did something.\nWow.\nJAMIE They said they drained it in '83.\nYeah, they drained it.\nYou could have all of the water you need, all of that land would have more water. The whole thing could be like that little patch. Literally, literally I'd say—I was with Devin Nunes, a congressman and other congressmen, we were going up. I was visiting them because they asked me to go up and visit their territory and I did. But I kept saying, \"Look at this land. It's beautiful, but it's so dry.\" And I thought they were going through like a desert like a drought. They said, \"No, we have water, but it gets—\" So I looked into it.\nAnd I got it done. I got it done. I could have water for all of that land, water for your forests. you know, Your forests are dry as a bone, okay?\nThat water could be routed. you know, You could have everything. Not only dangerous, billions of dollars a year they spend on forest fires. And you know, there's a case with the environment. They're not allowed to rake their forests because you're not allowed to touch it. When a tree falls down, after 18 months it becomes very dry. It's like you know, real firewood. It's bad.\nA tree that's up, these are all things I learned the hard way, the easy way. But when a tree is up, it sucks water. It's wet. I went to, that, they had a couple of horrible forest fires in California and I went. I said, \"You got a lot of trees standing.\" \"They were healthy trees, sir.\" I said, with this intense heat that you could see they were charred a little bit on the bottom, but they were gonna be all right because they're soaking wet because they suck up the water, right?\nBut when they fall, they're like—it's like lighting a match and you got to be able to clean. They call maintain your forest. So I was with the head of Austria. He said, \"You know what? It's a shame. I see all those forest fires in California and all they have to do is clean their forest,\" meaning rake it up, get rid of the leaves, you know, get rid of leaves that are sitting there for five years and—\nYou could certainly get rid of the dead, okay?\nEnvironmentally, they don't want to do that. They said no no, it's got to be nature and all this stuff. But in the meantime, this is exactly—But you could have—So it was the Department of Commerce that needed the approvals, but Gavin Newsom had to sign them. I got it all done. Nobody could believe it. It was all done. I said, \"I got it.\" You got so much water. All you have to do is sign. And that guy didn't wanna sign.\nI think, no, he didn't. No, I don't think so. He used to say he's a great President, and we got along. We did. We actually got along at that point. But I think somebody said, \" uh, You just can't continue to call him a great President.\" you know, They do say that. But we had it all done. He didn't sign. And then we got onto other things. And I said—every time I go to California, I said, \"You have so much water.\" They don't know it. I'm telling you, people living in Beverly Hills, they turn off their water. Same thing with the electric. They want to go to all electric cars, but they have brownouts every weekend you know.\nI'll terminate the mandate immediately, this mandate.\nThat will be done, I would say in my first day, maybe two days, because it's a little bit busy.\nOr Fukushima where you're not supposed to enter the land for 3,000 years or something. It's crazy.\nIt's what's happening.\nThat's what's happening.\nWell, if you look at the way the battery is made. But here's the other thing. We don't have—well, we do actually. It's being held. We have certain areas where we have great raw earth material and we're not allowed to use it because of the environment. And we have areas in California that have incredible raw earth and they're not allowing, and I'm gonna open it up. I'm gonna let 'em use it. China—\nBecause the environment's gonna be protected. You can do it. You can make a lake out of it, okay? We'll put back a lake. I mean, something nice about lakes. You can do things magnificently—\nAbsolutely. You have to do it carefully. But the problem, you know, China has all of those areas, most of those areas, and yet when they say go electric with the cars, China's gonna be the one that gives us the cars. All of those guys in Detroit are gonna be out of business. You're gonna make your electric cars over there.\nWe have a thing called gasoline, and we have more oil and gas under our feet than any other nation. you know, I had in Alaska, there's a find, it's called ANWR. I got it approved. Reagan couldn't get it. Nobody could get it. I got it all done. It was amazing. They were getting ready to start drilling, the equivalent, they think, of Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest finds in the world. It was all set to go and Biden comes in, his, one of his first orders were, we're not gonna use it. It would've been so good for the—We could have supplied all of Asia with oil and gas.\nThe negative was politically, they didn't think it was good for them. That's all.\nNo. Taking it from way down deep in the earth. Environmentally would've been fine.\nAbsolutely. Or otherwise—\nWell, I think windmills—Okay, so they talk about windmills.\nI think windmills are really disruptive. When you talk about the environment, they kill the birds. You want to see a bird cemetery, go under a windmill someday that hasn't been cleaned out with all the bird carcasses. You, it's like massive amounts of birds.\nOh, they're horrible.\nCorrect. Most expensive form of electricity is a windmill, and then they start to rust and rot.\nYou can't bury them.\nBy the way, they say you can't bury them. So, I even questioned that, but I'm not gonna get into it. But they say you can't bury them. So you have the blades and you can't bury the blades. You can bury the blades. It's not gonna matter. You can bury. You'll find areas you can bury. But they come up, this is what I mean, they come up with this, but the environmentalist dream is windmills everywhere. You know what happens to them? After five years, they start to rot. After 10 years, you have to replace them. Did you ever look at certain parts of California where they have heavy windmills and they've been abandoned and they're all different manufacturers and all different companies and they all—\nIt is the ugliest thing. It looks like a graveyard almost, a graveyard of windmills.\nIt's so bad. And the oceans—\nHow about in New Jersey? Off the coast of New Jersey, they wanna build, the people are going crazy not to build them. But where you have them, the whales are washing up on shore. So in 50 years they had one whale come ashore. Now they had like 18 come in the last year.\nWell, they say that the wind drives them crazy. It's a vibration because you have those—those things are 50 story buildings some of them. Fifty!\nThe wind is rushing, the things are blowing. It's a vibration and it makes noise. You know what it is? I want to be a whale psychiatrist. It drives the whales frickin' crazy and something happens with them. But for whatever reason, they're getting washed up on shore. And yet the environmentalists—\nBut the environmentalists, they don't talk about it. I think there's nothing uglier. I see it Scotland. I see it all over the world. You have this beautiful valley. It's been there for, in civilization, thousands of years, but millions of years, and all of a sudden you have these ugly windmills up.\nWell, nuclear is better. I, I think there's a little danger, nuclear, but we had some really bad nuclear. They did one in Alabama. They did one in, I think, South Carolina. They do them wrong. They build these massive things. Then the environmentalists get in—I don't want to go into a long story because it's too long for the show. This show is too valuable to talk about concrete, but they have hardened concrete. It's number 12 concrete. It's the hardest. It's harder than steel. It's incredible. They put up a wall and an inspector comes along those—\"Nope, nope. You're a quarter of an inch too—\" The wall might be eight feet wide. You're a quarter of an inch too short. I'm sorry. You got to rip down the wall. You got to—Because it's got to be poured contiguously. You're one quarter of an inch—I'm sorry, rip down. You can't rip it down. This stuff, you can't put a hammer through it. It's incredible. Concrete technology is unbelievable what's you know, what's happened. You think of concrete—\nWell, you have an inspector that comes along and he says, \"Take down a 25 zillion dollar wall.\" These things ended up costing 25 billion dollars. And they, one of them never got opened. But here's the story. So—France does it. France is largely nuclear, and they build small little compact plants, and if they need more, they build the same thing and they hook it up and they hook it up because they get too big and too complex and too expensive. And it is very clean. They say it's it's absolutely—you know, My uncle, I had a great uncle who was a great genius, just like other members of my family, but he was a professor at MIT for I think 41 years. He was the longest—When I was in the White House, the head of MIT, Princeton and Harvard came down to meet me, and the MIT person said, \"I have a book on your uncle Dr. John Trump. He was our longest serving professor. He was a great genius, sir. Do you know how—\"\nAnd uh, he knew everything about nuclear. From math to chemistry to nuclear, he knew it. And he said, \"Someday it's got to be the way to go.\" But the problem is it's so dangerous in terms of war. He said, \"Donald, someday,\"—this was a long time, Uncle John, Dr. John Trump, he said, \"Someday you'll have a little satchel at your side and you'll go into a building and you'll be able to blow up New York City.\" I said, \"Uncle John, that'll never happen.\" He's right. you know, He's right.\nThe power is so great.\nThe biggest problem in the world today is not global warming. It's nuclear warming. And we have idiots that are negotiating for us. We have a guy that doesn't make it past four o'clock, and it's not because of age. you know, I know so many guys in their late 80s, and they're better than—I said to one guy the other day, \"I think you're smarter than you were 25 years ago.\" I've known him a long time. He's 89 years old. He's sharp as—I mean, he's great. Biden gives people a bad name because that's not an old—that's not an age. I think they say it because I'm three or four years younger. you know, I think that's why they say it. They say his age. It's not his age. He's got a problem.\nOperations, yeah. He did. He did. Those are not good operations.\nIt's interesting because during the debate, I was uh, looking over him saying, \"This is strange.\" Sort of strange things were happening.\nI think so.\nI think they wanted to get—Well, there's a lot of theories. A lot of people said, do the debate now and we'll get him out.\nI think that maybe could be.\nIt is what happened. I think they also said do the debate now and get it over with.\nI don't think anybody thought he was gonna get out, really.\nThe debate got him out, but I think it's very unfair. Look, you have a bad debate, his numbers went down, but I think she's not doing very well right now, and I think she looks—\nI was never called by a pollster.\nYou know how polls are done? Oh, I'm gonna get myself in trouble.\nSo I really don't believe too much in 'em.\nWell, they were very ineffective because I thought I was doing well. I'd go to a place and I'd have 30, 40,000 people. Hillary would go, they have 500 people. And they tell me I'm gonna lose. I said, \"Why am I gonna lose?\" I had 40,000 people. She had 200 people. But you know, I have a theory, these pollsters, they charge you a lot of money too. you know, They charge you half a million bucks to do some stupid poll and they interview like 251 people. I don't think they interview them in many cases. I don't want to get myself in too much trouble.\nNo. I think they sit there, they make a deal, they get a half a million bucks, and they say, \"Trump's leading 51 to 49.\" They announce it and everybody says, \"Oh, oh.\" Do you understand?\nI think in a lot—Look, I'm a very common sense person. I think that they probably don't always poll. Some of them probably never poll. uh, What's the difference between 49 to 51 and 47 and a half?\nI don't know of one person in my whole life that ever got called by a pollster.\nBut I shouldn't say that because I'm doing very, you know, really well in the polls.\nSo this week I happen to believe in the numbers. I only believe them if they're good. No, I like them this month. But no, I honestly believe that there's probably a lot of fraud. I had a poll, Washington Post, ABC in the Hillary thing, on Wisconsin. They had me down 17 points the day before the election. I knew it was wrong because I had a rally, I had 29,000 people at a racetrack, and it was like zero degrees, Wisconsin, and they had me down 17 points. In other words, you had no chance. And I won.\nAnd I called up my pollster, good guy, good guy. And I believe he's legitimate. And you know, some of them are, and some of them are. I said, \"Tell me, why did they have me down so much?\" I mean, nobody's gonna believe them the next time. They said they don't care. When you're down 17 points, people are gonna stay home. They're not gonna vote because they're gonna say, \"I love Trump, but I'm not gonna waste my time. It's cold out.\" I said, \"But what if they make it four or five?\" He said, \"At four or five, they're gonna go and vote. At 17, they're not gonna go and vote.\" But think of it, this is the Washington Post, ABC poll. I was down 17 points in Wisconsin and I won. It's crooked stuff.\nWell, they say it made 10 point difference, and I lost by one, one tenth of a point. They say it was 22,000 votes. But look, it was much more than that. And I appreciate JD Vance saying that. And by the way, I think he was a great pick. Do you like JD?\nYou're allowed to say that.\nNo, I think he's good.\nHow did he do with it?\nIs that why you called me to do this?\nI'm only kidding. He was a nice guy.\nTiming is good.\nI do.\nIt zicked right there.\nYeah, it's pretty good. Yeah, it's a little—it's not like some of the wrestlers, some of the UFC fighters.\nNo, no. It got me, was sort of like a top shot. The point of the bullet was [inaudible], but you see the things take it off a little bit, but uh, it makes me a tougher guy. you know, The fighters, the fighters love their—You know Bo Nickal [mixed martial arts fighter]? He is a great fighter.\nHow's he gonna do? I think he's terrific.\nHe was almost undefeated in college.\nWhen is he fighting again? I want to—\nOh, that's gonna be interes—after the election.\nSo I'll either go as President or I'll be depressed and I won't bother going. I think they're having a fight right after.\nEven though she conceded.\nyou know, She conceded the night of the election because she was beaten.\nWell, look at these guys in Congress. All these sleazebags in Congress that are Democrats, they're still denying 2016, but now they don't so much because you know, they try and pin it on me. You don't hear them say—\n—but they denied it right up until the end.\nAnd you had legislatures that had to approve and they didn't approve and they went out and did it anyway, and you had ballot—you had old-fashioned ballot screwing. I mean, you had people going up and dropping in phony votes. You had unsigned ballots, et cetera, et cetera.\nThat was okay. Yeah.\nyou know, Kamala is a very low IQ person. She's a very low IQ. I'm for taking tests too. I think anybody that runs for President should take—they should give 'em tests. And it's not an age thing, it's not based—If you look back on history, '70s and '80s, your greatest—some of your greatest leaders in the world, world history, long time, world history, they were in their 70s and their 80s. But I think you should take cognitive tests. I think everybody—they say it's unconstitutional, but I think—\nI think Kamala should have a test because there's something missing. There's something wrong with her.\nBut you either have it or you don't.\nLook, this is an interview. You, we've covered a lot of territory right, and it's fine, I don't care. I want to. I think it's much more interesting. She, to do an interview with uh, Anderson Cooper, a softball, crazy softball interview. She took two days off and she studied and studied all day long and then she comes out with a result that was a real embarrassment. That was a really bad interview. She couldn't answer a question. And every question's not answered. I mean, like, \"What would you do your first day in office?\" Okay, I'll build a wall. I won't build a wall. There's a hundred things you can say. Just say anything. uh, There's something off with her.\nJoe, we're dealing with the smartest people. They hate when I say—When the press, when I call President Xi, they said he called President Xi brilliant. Well, he's a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. I mean, he's a brilliant guy whether you like it or not, and they go crazy and say, \"Oh—\"\nYeah, of course not. But actually, we have evil people in our country.\nIf you have a smart President, he can deal with Russia. He can deal with all of it. I had a, I had a—Russia would've never gone into Ukraine if I were President.\nAutomatic. Two things. I told him. I said, \"Vladimir, you're not going in.\" I used to talk to him all the time. \"You're not going in.\" I can't tell you what I told him because I think it would be inappropriate. But someday he'll tell you. But he would've never gone in. But you know why else he wouldn't have gone in? Oil prices at $40 a barrel wouldn't have allowed him, wouldn't have given him the money to prosecute that war. Wouldn't have given him the money.\nI said it with President—I was with President Xi. I said—It was almost the same conversation. With Vladimir, it was Moscow. With President Xi, it was Beijing. It was almost the exact same conversation. I said, \"Don't do it.\" He would've never done it.\nThe day I left, they flew 28 bombers over the middle of Taiwan, 28 bombers. And it's the apple of his eye. And the same thing with Russia. It's the apple. Ukraine is the apple of his eye. I used to talk to him. I had a very good relationship with him. He wouldn't have done it. He would've never done it.\nBut he also wouldn't have done it because of the oil. You know, one of the reasons that what happened is, number one, he doesn't respect Biden at all. Not even a little bit. And who the hell would? But he doesn't respect him. But when he saw what happened in Afghanistan, how horribly that was handled, number one, you take the soldiers out last, not first, okay? That was their big mistake. And we had that thing charted out and they weren't obeying us. They weren't—uh, Abdul is the head of the Taliban. Boom, boom, he had to do all these things. Some he didn't do. I said, \"Nope, you're not do—you gotta do them all.\"\nThis guy, he immediately took all—He left the equipment behind. 13 soldiers dead. But he took everybody out. He took his soldiers out before. A child would know—that's where Milley was so stupid. He was such a stupid guy, Milley. Okay, those generals should have all been fired, the Afghan. The people that were involved with Afghanistan should have all been fired. Then they'd be writing books about him, how stupid he was and bad he was. But you take your soldiers out last.\nI had a, a big rally and I saw a child in the front row uh, about a year and a half ago, and I called the child up. I said, \"Do you mind if I borrow your child?\" \"Oh, yes, please.\" And they came up. Kids five years—I gave them quick details. I said, \"We want to get out of this place, and we have this, and we have this, and we have the equipment.\" I gave him a little thing. I said, \"Do you take your soldiers out first or last after everything's done?\" \"You take them out last, sir.\" A child would know that. We took our soldiers out first.\nAnd we left Bagram.\nThe best, the best equipment yet, to embarrass us, the best equipment in the world.\n—the best equipment in the world behind.\nWell, number one, we would've taken it out. Just so you—Go back a little bit further. I had a couple of conversations with Abdul, and from the time I had those conversations, because they were shooting our soldiers with the sniper stuff. They were shooting, they were shooting a lot of them. They were shooting a lot with Obama, much less with me, but they were shooting 'em. And I said, \"Get this guy on the phone.\" The press went nuts when they heard this. I had a great conversation with—It was a tough conversation.\nEighteen months later, there wasn't one soldier that was ever shot at, and even Biden admitted it in a moment of stupidity because he shouldn't admit it. His people went nuts. He said, \"Yeah, well, I will admit no soldier—\" We didn't have a soldier killed in 18 months in Afghanistan. Not one soldier was killed because he understood what was gonna happen if that happened. I didn't have one soldier.\nSo then when I left, after having gotten more votes than any sitting President in the history of the country, and much more votes than I got in 2016, when I left, they started shooting our soldiers. But more importantly, what they did is they did that whole thing with you know, leaving. He shouldn't have left. Number one, should have left from Bagram because Bagram's this massive base, it's got tremendous acreage around it, tremendous. It's a very big—It was built many years ago and part of the reason you wouldn't have taken that is because it goes to China, one hour from where China makes its nuclear missiles. You should have never left Bagram, number one. They should have left from Bagram. They should have left last. They shoulda got—you know, we have Americans that are still there. They should have taken all their equipment out, everything, every plane, every screw should have been taken out, every tent. And I said that. That's when I realized that Milley was a dummy. I said, \"We're leaving, but I want to get everything out.\" \"Sir, it's cheaper to leave it.\" I said, \"What do you mean leave it?\"\nYeah, he said it's cheaper to leave it. That was his—\nCheaper. He said, it's cheaper. \"Sir—\nHe just said cheaper. I said, \"I want every plane. I want every tank. I want the goggles.\" They have night goggles. They have all this stuff that these guys now have. He said, \"Sir, it's cheaper to get out and leave it.\" I said, \"So you think it's cheaper to leave $150 million brand new airplane in there than it is to fly it out with a tank of jet fuel and put it in Pakistan or just fly it directly back?\" \"It's cheaper to leave it.\" I said, \"This guy's nuts.\" I'm telling you, he was so stupid. He was so unwise. He was like an unwise man. And there were a number of them.\nBut I defeated ISIS with the greatest generals. I had a guy who was so great. I flew to Iraq and I met the real generals, not these idiots that we deal with. And we knocked out—you know, I defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. They said it would take five years. I did it in a matter of a few—literally a few weeks. And we hit them hard. And he said, \"Sir, we're gonna hit them here. We're gonna hit them there. We're gonna hit him here, there.\" And I said, \"This guy's great. I like this guy.\" I was told it would take five years. That's why I went. I said, \"How could it take five years? We have brand new fighters, we have the best planes, the best weapons, the best guns, the best bombs. How could it possibly take that long?\"\nAnd I flew to, I flew in, left at three o'clock in the morning. Nobody knew I was going. I got on Air Force One and we started flying, and when we reached about half an hour away from Iraq, that was where the airport was, big airport, about a half an hour away, they said, \"Sir, I'm sorry, you'll have to turn off all your lights.\" \"Why?\" \"We're getting close to our site, our land.\" I said, \"We spent $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights.\" Think of this, 20 years, $8 trillion that we can't leave the lights on in a plane. I said, \"That's okay. Turn the lights off. I'm not gonna fight them this one.\"\nYeah, too dangerous because they see the light up in the air.\nThey'll shoot at it. So, uh, I said, \"Turn the lights off.\" Then they said, sir, we're gonna also pull your shades if that's okay.\" Said, \"That's okay.\" The plane pitch black. All the lights outside, the blinking they call them the blinking reds. They were all turned off. And I like to sit with pilots a lot of times, and these guys are specimens. I always say they're better looking than Tom Cruise. And they're even taller, like perfect specimens. These guys, like for a fighter, you have some guys that are perfect specimens, these guys. you know, They pick the best pilots in the United States Air Force to fly Air Force One.\nAnd I get up there and I'm sitting—I'm feeling my way up. It's up high because 747s you go through the stairs. But I sort of knew my way up. There wasn't a light in the plane. I'm saying, \"Can you imagine? We spent trillions of dollars and we're trying to fly in blind.\" But I got into the plane. The cockpit is dark black, little, tiny light, you could see the pilot, a perfect looking human being. His copilot, everybody was perfect. They were all like movie stars. you know, I could have cast a movie with these guys and nobody would believe it because they were too good-looking. So I said, \"How are we doing, Captain?\" \"Sir, we'll be landing in 10 minutes.\" And I look outside, there's not a light. And I'm sitting—you know, I've landed a lot of planes and you see little lights at least. There's nothing. It's just pure desert. And I said, \"Okay, Captain, good.\" But I'm looking. Now we're—you've been to many planes where it has the computer sign saying 1,000 feet.\nIt goes, \"1,000, 900, 800.\" It's a computer voice but it sounds like—But it's an incredible voice. \"700.\" I say, \"Captain, are we okay?\" I'm looking. \"Are we okay, Captain? uh, There's no lights.\" And I'm looking—normally when you land—Because I sit with pilots a lot. I think it's great. I think it's a great profession, everything. They're incredible. These machines are incredible. He said, \"Sir, we're fine. No problem, sir.\" I said—I'm going, \"I don't see any lights up there, Captain. Sure we're okay?\" So, I'm exaggerating a little bit. Problem with exaggerating, they'll tell the story, they'll say, \"Trump was a coward.\" So I'm sitting with him. He goes, \"500\" And I'm telling you, there wasn't a light on the runway, nothing. And we're going in. \"You okay, Captain? Everything good?\" \"Yes, sir. No problem. We'll be down in about one minute, sir.\" And I'm telling you, Joe, you know, there's always a light. There's not a little pin.\nAnd all of a sudden, pssh and you hear it, bah, bah, perfect landing like glass. That's how good—These guys between the equipment and—it's genius. It's pure—it was so dark, you couldn't see a thing. There was no runway. You wouldn't know where the hell you are. You're in the middle of a desert. And then I got out of the plane, I said, \"Thank you, Captain. It's a great job.\" And then I got out of the plane and I'm going down and I see a general and another general, and I see a staff sergeant, a drill sergeant and various guys, all central casting. Central casting. They said, \"Sir, would you like to rest?\" I said, \"I don't want to rest. I want to figure out what the hell are we doing with ISIS? I'm hearing, we can't—it's gonna take years.\" \"No sir. We can do it very quickly, sir.\"\nAnd, anyway, we go into the room. Biden would've taken a nap for four days and then left without a meeting. So we go into the room and they have these guys. I say, \" How long can you do it? How long?\" \"We can do it in a couple of weeks, sir.\" I said, \"Wait a minute. They told me five years.\" \"We can do it in—\" I don't know. He gave me a number like oohh [gestures], like in no time. I said, \"Why haven't you done it?\" \"Because the orders came in from Washington, sir. And they would come here and tell us what to do.\" \"Don't you challenge those or—?\" \"We're not allowed to do that, sir. That's not the military way. They tell us what to do and we have to respect them. I just—\nI think it's a bad system. When Mattis goes there or when Milley goes there, who's stupid, and they tell these guys that are actually smart what to do, and the guys that are smart are saying, \"We don't like what they're doing.\" But they're not allowed to, sort of, counteract. Plus the guys that went there are arrogant. you know, They're arrogant fools. They're stupid fools. uh, the way they pulled out, you know as an example, the way they pulled out of Afghanistan with the people falling off the planes—\nIt was worse than Vietnam with the helicopters falling. It was so bad. There was no reason for it. Anyway, so we knocked them out and we have great military, we have great people, but not the television guys. And I rebuilt the military and then they gave a chunk of it—I have to tell you, as much as it is, it's a tiny little piece. Believe it or not. We have an unbelievable—I rebuilt the military. I rebuilt our nuclear, and in a way I hated to redo it, but I got to realize how powerful that nuclear is. Joe, one bomb, Israel is gone. But forget. One bomb could take out the entire East Coast. It's so bad.\nAnd I watched these poor fools talking about our oceans will rise one-eighth of an inch over the next 500 years. I mean, we have people, we have countries, right now you have five countries. And don't underestimate, North, North Korea, if you take a look at North Korea, their nuc—I was there. I was with Kim Jong. I got along great rel—I got along great with him. you know, The press is, \"He got along good.\" That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. It's a great thing. Obama thought we were gonna go to war with North Korea. When I met with Obama just prior to the takeover, you know, you meet, you have sort of a ceremonial meeting, but it lasted a long time, a lot longer than it was supposed to last. I said, \"What's the biggest problem?\" He said, \"North Korea.\" By the time I finished, I was, we had no problem with North Korea. We were really—It was a little tough at the beginning, remember?\nHe said, \"I have a red button on my desk.\" I said, \"I have a red button also, but mine's bigger than yours and mine works.\"\nYeah, Little Rocket—I said, \"Little Rocket Man, you're gonna burn in hell.\" And it was a rough—Oh, so rough that people were worried. This is crazy. And then one day I got a call, sort of like a fight. I got a call. You ever see one of them pounding fight? And then all of a sudden, but I got a call and it was from him, meaning his people, they wanted to meet. They wouldn't meet Obama. He tried to meet. They wouldn't even talk to him about it. And I think he expected to go to war. I actually do. I believe he expected to go. And we checked their nuclear stockpile. It is substantial. I mean it's, I said—I got to know him very well. I got to know him better than anybody. Anybody. And I said, \"Do you ever do anything else? Why don't you go take it easy and relax? Go to the beach. You have beautiful beach, nice beachfront property.\" you know, Kiddingly. I said, \"You're always building nuclear, just relax. You don't have to do it. Let's build some condos on your shoreline.\" They actually have gorgeous stuff.\nAnd he said, \" uh, I just have to do it because I need it for my safety et cetera.\" I got to know him very well. We had no problem with him. If you have a smart problem—If you have a smart, really the right President, the smart President, you're not gonna have a problem. And I say it to people, we have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within. And it drives 'em crazy when I use that term. But we have an enemy from within. We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful. When you look at what's happening at our border, Joe, when you have people coming in that—When other countries are allowed to empty their prisons into our country with murderers—We had 13,099 murderers dropped in our country over the last three years.\nRapists, drug dealers, drug lords, terrorists.\nCorrect. People from mental institutions.\nHundreds to hundreds of thousands of major criminals, tougher and worse than anybody we have. These are—\nThat's right.\nJust the beginning.\nThis is years after the fact. The damage was already done.\nAnd the bill was nothing. It allowed two million people in, they were gonna get amnesty. It was a horrible bill. It didn't protect us at all.\nWell, [inaudible] what their strategy was.\nThey're in swing states. Well, that's not a swing state. I'm gonna win Ohio by a lot. So that's not a swing, but it's called Springfield, Ohio to be exact. And Springfield, Ohio is this very nice community of 52,000 people that just had 32,000 migrants that don't speak the language dropped into their community. You can't get into a hospital. You can't get into a school. It's gone from a beautiful little place to a horror show. And the mayor is a nice guy. And the mayor says, \"We're looking for interpreters.\" I said, \"No, you've got to remove them and bring them back to their country.\" Mostly Haitians in this case. But they speak no, they speak no language. They speak no English.\nIn fact, even the language, they do speak, I mean they can't get interpreters. They can't do anything. And the mayor's trying to be politically correct. They're all trying to be. In Aurora, Colorado, you have the, the probably the worst gang—MS-13 might even be—you know, those two are the worst gangs. These are Venezuelan gangs. They have taken over apartment complexes and they're gonna want to take over the whole thing. And you have a weak Governor, pathetic Governor, uh, who's a radical left Democrat. He doesn't know what the hell to do. But you have it in many other communities, but they don't like to talk about it because you know, it's bad for the community to talk about it. These people have been let in here by this imbecile. She's—and I mean it, she's a low IQ person. Low IQ.\nWell, she was in charge of the border.\nSure.\nIt was used for shipping and now it's used to deal with the cartels. The cartel, heads of the cartel, rich people by the way, these are loaded, these people have so much money. They would call up—think of this: They call up the app and the app tells them where they should take their load of illegal migrants from the Congo. We have a lot from the Congo, prisons in the Congo. uh, I made a little bit of a sarcastic joke. A man named Dana White [CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship], who you love, who I love, I assume you love him. I—\nI, I, I don't know. Maybe.\nHe is the greatest guy.\nI always say nobody's indispensable. Everybody can be replaced. Maybe you can't be. You might not be. But they know I truly, I don't think—you know the thing, they sold it for four billion. I said, \"Wha the hell, who the hell is gonna pay four billion?\" And they made like a great deal.\nBecause of him. Take him out, I think it's whole different ball game but—\nHe's also the greatest guy. He spoke my, at the whole thing with I had just been shot and he got up and he spoke so, better than anybody. I mean, who would be better to introduce you? I asked, of all the people, and I know the biggest people in the world, and they all would've loved to have done it. I said, \"Dana, would you do it?\" you know, It was interesting. He was away. And he said to the people, one of my guys called, said, \"I won't be able to do it. She had just left with my wife and family, I won't.\" I said, \"Ooh.\" He said, \"No, yeah.\"\nI was a little surprised, even though I knew he was very far away. He was in some place some—you know, And he deserved it with his family, you know, the whole thing. And then I said, \"All right. That's—\" So we're looking at who are we gonna get. And all of a sudden she comes in, \"Sir, Dana White just said he's going to do it. And he's coming back in tonight. He's taking it.\" But, you know, The guy is just an incredible guy. And, he's like a tough champion, but loyal. Yeah, he's got to be one of your favorite people. He's one of my favorite people.\nSo would you have—uh, Because what you're doing here is incredible. I mean, everybody tells me. All I know is today I'm going—\"You're on Joe Rogan today.\" People are telling me like that's—. I say, \"How the hell do you know that?\" But, its uh, it's what you've done here is amazing. Where would you be if you didn't do the UFC stuff? Would you have this show, do you think?\nWould it be at the same level?\nBut you would have the show?\nWill you always want to do—First of all, you love UFC?\nYou love the fights. I watch you. You are loving it. They could pay you nothing, you'd be very—\nHe's an amazing guy.\nOh, wow. Wow.\nAnd then I came along and I gave him the sites.\nAnd he never forgot it.\nJust to interrupt you for one sec. So, they couldn't get a site because it was too dangerous and everybody was against it and they couldn't get licensed. And I gave him the first two or three sites. And they were great. And by the way, I went to the first fight. I said, \"I never saw anything like this.\" It was crazy. It was so good. Take the best fight you've ever—It was like that fight. It was so good that I gave it to him again, and again. And all of a sudden it caught on.\nBut you know, when I wasn't in vogue, I've had time, you probably never had a time, but I had times when I wasn't exactly in vogue. Dana, they called him, he said, \"He's the greatest guy. There's nobody like him.\" He said, \"I'll never say anything bad about that guy because when I needed—\" Because they were having a hard time at the beginning, they almost pulled the plug a couple of times, right? He said, \"He stood up and he gave us stuff that nobody else gave us, and nobody wanted anything to do.\" And he said, \"I will never—\" And there was a time where it would've been very popular for him to say bad stuff about me. He said the greatest stuff about me. He said, \"You're gonna try and get me to say bad stuff about Trump but I'm never doing it.\" So he's—\nAn unusual guy.\nHe's a fantastic guy.\nLess controversial, I mean, now certainly.\nCan boxing make it?\nBut it seems to be—so unimportant now by comparison to UFC, don't you think?\n[inaudible].\nIf Dana's involved, he'll probably make it good.\nThe amazing thing though, the, the, in fighting, no UFC fighter they say has ever died, and it looks to me much more violent than boxing. Many boxers have died. Isn't it interesting? And Dana tells me because they take so many shots to the face.\nWow, oh, that's interesting.\nThat's right.\nWhich, look, they should do that. you know, I'm not, I'm not the fighter, but those 15 round fights were unbelievable.\nThey were unbelievable. In terms of—\nIn terms of entertainment, those were the championship reps. Those were the greatest fights ever.\nThat was brutal.\nWho's the greatest UFC fighter, in your—are you allowed to say, in your opinion? It's tough for you to say because you do this, but who do you think is the greatest of the fighters?\n[inaudible].\nAnd Khabib. What about Khabib?\nAnd probably never lost a round. They say he—\nA round.\nThey're, great athletes, though.\nYes. It's just brutal.\nI'll never forget, so there was a fighter named James Toney.\nHe fought as a very light fighter and he ended up as a heavyweight. This guy went through everything. He was almost like a lightweight.\nAnd, and, and, I've never seen that.\nAnd he was a real fighter.\nSo James Toney and I think it was uh, St. George—\nSt-Pierre. I think was him. Who did he fight? James Toney—\nHe fought a UFC fighter.\nWas it Randy Couture? Maybe.\nIt was the most—And he's half the size. And he just, once he got to the ankles—In fact, the announcer said, \"It's over.\" And he put him to sleep.\nAnd James, he was a nice guy, but he was talking big because he was much bigger. He was a pretty big guy.\nYou think so?\nBut I never forgot it.\nIt was over very quickly. And he's lying, sleeping on the mat and he was talking, he was doing the Muhammad Ali stuff, but it didn't work out. But I remember—\nYeah, that was Couture probably, wasn't it?\nWas he, was he one of the greatest?\nAnderson Silva.\nAnd you have a couple now that are pretty good.\nCorrect.\nHe's looking very good.\nIf they stopped a little bit sooner, some of them would've had—you know, There are a couple of that you just mentioned without mentioning names, if they stopped, they had the perfect—they were unbelievable. And then at a certain age, they start getting knocked out, right?\nIt's okay.\nWell, Anderson Silva was essentially unbeatable and then he lost a close one. Then all of a sudden he had—\nRight, that's right.\nThat was a bad one.\nYou're never the same because you can't kick.\nIt always amazed me how the kicker—I mean, you have those cases—but the kicker will do tremendous damage to somebody's leg, but their leg doesn't seem to get damaged. Isn't it sort of amazing?\nMore than you think.\nThey're kicking that.\nOh, wow.\nI've never seen.\nBut see, I watch your enthusiasm now, right?\nAnd it's like, that's why you're good at what—nobody does this better. Without the enthusiasm, forget it.\nAnd you love going in there after the fight, and they're sweating all over you. They're slopping all over you. You're beautiful.\nDoes that bother you a little bit?\nLike two weeks ago when the guy was—I never saw it.\nHe—more stuff came out of his nose.\nThat's great.\nYou've done a great job.\nYou've done a great job.\nI brought this chart for you.\nBecause I had a feeling you'd be asking me.\nLook at this chart. These are healthier countries. Look where the United States is. I'm gonna send this to R.F.K Jr. Look at that.\nI could see it. A lot of it's—\nA lot of it's obesity.\nSame chart. Did you see that?\nWow, that's pretty good. Jamie's the best.\nHe's very good.\nNo, but look at that. Look where the USA is.\nBut R.F.K is gonna be very—you know, I think he's a great guy. I think he's great.\nIt's a good combination.\nOh, I am. But the only thing I want to be a little careful about with him is the environmental, because you know, he doesn't like oil. I love oil and gas. I think you know, it's—\n—the fire. So I'm gonna keep him out of a little. I said, \"Focus on health, focus, you can do whatever you want.\" But I uh, got to be a little bit careful with the liquid gold, you know.\nHere's the one, here's the one that my all-time favorite though.\nSee the arrow right here. That's when I left. The day I left.\nTo not work with who?\nYes.\nI would say that—and you know, I think in many ways they've done a good job, in many ways they've done a bad job. But I would say that the uh, big pharma wasn't thrilled when they heard that, you know I have a—I've actually always gotten along very well with him. I've known him a long time. He's a different kind of a guy. He's very smart, great guy, and he's very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. He thinks we spend a fortune on pesticides, on all this stuff, and then you end up at—that chart is a terrible chart, the one previous. It's such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don't spend 10 cents. So, and you save a lot of money. But yeah, we've, I've had some people that aren't exactly thrilled. You can imagine, right?\nIt's a good question actually.\nIt doesn't affect me.\nI would say that's an understatement, yes.\nWell look, they've come up with some amazing things. I mean, I don't know how you feel. I know you're against the vaccines, certain vaccines. But like the polio vaccine, people had polio, they were, it was like a disaster. And they came up, Dr. Salk, and he came up with a vaccine, and there's no polio. Now, uh, very interesting there hasn't been polio, but now in the Gaza Strip—can you believe that? Have you heard that? There's been a big strain of polio coming out in the Gaza Strip?\nI don't know.\nOh, I see. See, I haven't heard that. Yeah.\nI mean, all I can do is I sit down and I listen to him, and—and I'll give it total—I would love him to be right, because it's, if he's right, it's a lot less expensive, generally speaking.\n—and then you say, \"It causes cancer and baldness,\" we don't like baldness here.\nAnd this, and that, and eyesight, and you can lose your vision. And you know, I actually asked one of these guys, \"I would never take—\" I mean, it causes things that are so bad, they go through a whole list. I guess they save some liability, but, man. I said, \"Does that affect the purchase?\" They say it really does. When they, there's something you have and you read, and then they go through the list of—\n—the potential side—it's not even—the potential side effects. I mean, a lot of people are just—I asked that question. People hear that. When I hear it, I, I am gonna take a pass. It says, \"May affect your vision, may cause blindness, may this—\"\nYes.\nAnd the pesticides and things like that on the plants. What do you think of that?\nRight. That's right. That's right.\nThey just gave me that chart because they said, \"You may want to discuss this topic,\" which I know is a big topic for you. And when I looked at that chart and I looked at how unhealthy we are as a nation, that's a pretty big thing.\nNo, it's genetics, I believe. I'm a big believer—\nI really am. My father, uh, was, he was an old guy—\nBoth of my parents—it, it, for me, it's good.\nIt really is. It's fresh air—\n—you're outside. Even mentally, you are focused on that three-footer, and for a couple of hours you're not—And I go quick. I play fast, real fast, and I'm in, I'm out. But you know, it gives me—I was never one that could run on a treadmill, and I just, I can do it. When passing a physical, they asked me to run on a treadmill, and then they make it steeper, and steeper, and steeper. And the doctor said, it was at Walter Reed, they said, \"It's unbelievable.\" I couldda gone, I'm telling you, I felt I could have gone all day. But I said, \"Doc, I can do this all day long. I'm not, I have no problem.\" But it's boring to me, do you understand?\nIt's just boring.\nBut I did it for so long, they couldn't believe it, that I did it. And I never did, I don't do it, I don't really—I have friends that run on this stuff all day long. But I had no problem doing it, but it's really boring. So with golf or something, or tennis, or whatever, but golf, as you get older, there's something really good about it. And you have competition with your friends, you know, there's something—\nAnd it's a great handicap sport.\nIt gives you a couple of hours. you know, It's interesting, with tennis, if you're much better than somebody, you can't really play with somebody. you know, It doesn't work. You can give them the equivalent of strokes, right, but it's not the same. With golf, you can play with a lousy guy and give him a stroke a hole or two strokes a hole or something. It's a good handicapping sport.\nBut it gives me a little exercise. But I haven't played uh, in a long time. I won 32 club championships, can you believe it?\nuh, No. What I did is I played with Bryson DeChambeau. Do you know Bryson?\nThe pro. He's a great player. And we played, it was a certain thing that we played, I guess called breaking 50 or something. 50, we play from a certain tee, and if you can break 50—And it got tremendous ratings, it was sort of like a crazy thing. He's a great guy. He's a great—\nI don't know. I know I haven't—\nI may have. I think I did. Yeah, maybe I did. But you know, I view it very interestingly. I'm running for President of the United States, to me, it's such a big deal. It's so important. So I've got now—\nIt's 100 times bigger than the Super Bowl, and it's one person. So you're down to two people, and we start off at nine billion, because you have nine billion, they say, in the world. Who knows what that number is? But you get down to 350 million. Sadly, we have no idea what we have in this country, but let's assume it's 325, 350. And you're down to two people. It's the biggest thing in the world. And when I heard she took off yesterday, and she took off the day before, and she's gonna take off tomorrow or the next day—I haven't taken a day off in 56 days. That's a long time. I haven't taken one day off. I didn't, I don't want to play golf, this is too exciting. Golf is great, but this is too exciting. This is more exciting than anything you can do. And the thing is—\nIt's the homestretch. Who would take a day off? So we have 11 days left now, and, think of it, so I think I've gone 54, 55 days in a row, no days off. And I make speeches oftentimes, you know, sometimes not, but I make speeches. And when you make a speech—and my speeches last a long time because of the weave, I mean I weave stories it, and if you don't, if you just read a teleprompter, nobody's gonna be very excited. You got to weave it out. But as you say, you always have to get right back to what—Otherwise it's no good. But the weave is very, very important. Very few weavers around. But it's a big strain on your—you know, It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. uh, You gotta be careful with the voice. You can lose that voice. The voice wasn't designed—I said today—\nSo, I made a big one last night. I was in Las Vegas, a big one the night before in Arizona, big one. I mean, they're all big. We have the—there's never been anything like it in terms of crowds. Never been close. Never been close. They say, \"He talks about crowd size.\" You know what's very interesting? So we get crowds that are really big. And I say, \"You know, I've never had a story—\" Because I don't get good press. I don't think I've had a good story in years. I really don't. I don't, I swear, I don't think I—You were talking about it a little bit with Oprah how everybody loved me. I don't think, I became President of the United State, I did great the second time, I did much better. I don't want to get you in any disputes, but I won that second election so easy. And not just because of—\nBut wait.\nBut here's the thing. I did that and now I've gotten the nomination again. And don't forget to get these nominations, you go against very smart people. Ron DeSantis was hot, gotta go through him. Nikki Haley was hot, had to go through her. I went through everybody, record time, right? Record time. I got three nominations in a row, uh, won the first time, did much better the second time. you know, I get millions of votes more the second time. And now I'm doing it a third time. And, and it's an incredible thing, I never get a good story. I only get bad press. Now, I will say this, it's a lot easier if you're a Democrat. If I were a Democrat—\nI would get a lot of positive press.\nIt's not even believable.\nBut it's getting younger. Let me tell you. It's getting for us, for a conservative—And I don't even—\nI think so.\nThe bloodbath hoax.\nI was talking about the auto industry. It's a bloodbath because Japan and China are taking our auto. And I said, \"It's a bloodbath.\" They said, \"Ah, he used the word \"bloodbath.\" You know, you'd think if somebody—\nThat's right. That's right.\nIt's a terrible thing they do.\nWell look at the ratings. Shows like yours—So I have a son who's very smart and tall, Baron. Right? And he knows all about you. He knows about guys I never heard of. He said, \"Dad, you don't know how big they are. They're big.\" He was telling me how big. I said, \"Who the hell is he?\" Like Ross, I didn't—He said, \"Dad, he's a great guy.\" I mean, guys that are doing—It's a whole new world out there.\nBut I'm on TikTok now.\nAnd I've done really well. No, but you know the crazy? Have you seen the numbers? I've billions like billions of hits. It's crazy.\nAnd I've gone up 30 points. A Republican is always down 30 with young people. I'm plus 30, and I'm on Tok, TikTok.\nIts had a huge impact.\nYeah, they are.\nIt's a big difference—there's a big difference now, even in just a couple of years—I was shaking hands with people. They're young people—\nYeah, I never thought about it that way. I think you're right.\nJoe, they come after their political opponent.\nI got more guys—I always say, you know, I kid, but I'm not kidding. I've been investigated more than Alphonse Capone. He was the meanest of them all. He'd kill you in two seconds if he didn't like you, right? I've been under investigation more than Alphonse Capone only because it's political opponent stuff. And I've won. I won the big case in Florida. I'm winning the other stuff. You win. But you know what they did? They did something that's only done in Third World countries, they came after their political opponent.\nI could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.\nOf course, yeah. Yeah, isn't it great?\nI heard it, somebody was defending me today, says, \"No, that's—\" They say, \"That's what you're doing to him.\" They're going, \"He's gonna put us in jail. He's gonna invest—\"\nThey said, \"That's what you're doing to him.\" A lot of people say, \"Will you do that? Will you do that to him, to them if you win?\" The presidency has tremendous power. I could have put Crooked Hillary in jail.\nI didn't.\nNo, I couldn't even imagine. You have, first of all, Secretary of State, but more importantly, the wife of the President of the United States of America going into jail. And if you ever saw, when I'd say something about her, they're all say—I didn't say it. I never said it. They say, \"Lock her up. Lock her up.\" And I'd always go, \"Take it easy. Just relax. We're gonna win this thing. Take it easy. Take it easy.\" And I'm telling you, I kept it down, just the opposite. Now they say, \"Oh, Trump wanted to put her in jail.\" No, I saved her from going to jail. They had more stuff on her.\nAnd Comey had it, because when Comey got up—and he stupidly, because he's a stupid guy too—he's a stupid son of a bitch. He got up, Joe, he got up, and instead of saying she's innocent of all charges, he went over each charge, and each charge was a killer. And he'd go, \"And as far as her doing this, she's innocent. And this—\" And then he said, \"Only an unfair prosecutor would go—\" But every time you heard these charges, they sounded so bad. They were bad. And all it was is he wanted more airtime. If you would've gone up and said, \"I've thoroughly investigated Hillary Clinton, and she's done nothing that we feel is wrong,\" it would've ended. Instead, he wanted to be up there because he's a, he's a PR hound. He's a hog. And he starts going through the—and you know what he had? They had a huge problem, because FBI is great, the people there. Not the top people, the people, the real people, the people that work there. It's like the real generals that I told you about that defeated ISIS in record time. The FBI guys are great. I'll bet you I'd be at 95% in the FBI.\nUnderneath—and, and so here's the thing. So he goes with Hillary, and instead of just saying, he goes through each charge.\nAnd even I would say, \"Man, those are bad charges.\" And this is before I got—\nDon't forget, this is before I got there.\nNow, he was trying to protect her, but he did her a great disservice.\nHe was stupid.\nYeah, totally.\nThey do. Well, they not only cut you off. Well, what I'd rather do is we'll do it another time, and I would bring in papers that you would not believe. So many different papers. That election was so crooked. It was the most crooked election.\nWell, let's start, let's start on the top and the easy ones.\nThey were supposed to get legislative approval to do the things they did, and they didn't get it. In many cases, they didn't get it.\nAnything. When they made—\nLike for extensions of the voting, for, for, for voting earlier, for this, all different things. By law, they had to get legislative approvals. You don't have to go any further than that. If you take a look at Wisconsin, uh, they virtually admitted that the election was rigged, robbed, and stolen. They wouldn't give access in certain areas to the ballots because the ballots weren't signed. They weren't originals. They were—we could go into this stuff. We could go into the ballots or we could go into the overall. I'll give you another one.\nLet me just give you one more before.\n51 intelligence agents come up that the laptop was from Russia. It turned out to be totally false. It wasn't—\nThey say that made—I don't believe it's this much, but it doesn't matter. I won by like—I lost by—I didn't lose. But, they say I lost—Joe, they say I lost by 22,000 votes. That's like one 10th of 1% less than that. It's a tiny little thing. 22,000 votes, spread over, that's spread over this, this period. So 51 intelligence agents lied. They lied. They lied. They knew it was. It was Hunter's. It was from his bed. It was Hunter's laptop. They said it was created by Russia. Russia, Russia. Russia. It was the Russia hoax. The Russia hoax was a big hoax. It was all a big hoax. So they get more—\nBut that is a big example. They say it made a 17 point difference. That's a big example. But that's only one. And you could go into the ballots where they wouldn't give you access to the ballots. You could go into the ballot harvesting. You could go into $500 million for the lock boxes.\nNo, it was proven it didn't happen.\nBut it took two and a half years to prove.\n100%.\nCorrect, the opposite. I was actually the opposite of a dictator. I was a very straight guy. But look, those three things, you take those three things, each one of them by themselves causes the result to be different, okay?\nAnd then you can go into 100 other things. There's so many. We can't have corrupt elections and we can't have open borders. We need, we need a—to have a country, you need borders, you need fair elections. And I'll tell you the other thing you need is you need a free and fair press. One of the things I like about doing a show like this, can you imagine Kamala doing this show?\nShe wasn't gonna do it.\nShe's not going do it.\nIf she did this kind of an interview with you—I hope she does, because it would be a mess. She'd be laying on the floor, Kamala. You'd be saying, \"Call in the medics.\"\nI think you have to have the debates, though.\nWell, you may. I mean, it may get a little—They used to do it that way.\nYeah. They used to do it that way in the old days.\nWell, and no crowd. How about no crowd?\nI would rather have a crowd.\nBut I would rather, but I had no—So they gave me an alternative. I don't think he wanted the debate.\nBecause I think they thought I wasn't gonna accept it. So I believe what they wanted to do is have me not accept. So they gave me a deal I couldn't refuse, and I said, \"I'll do it.\" OK? It's like the mob. I'll take it. So they came to me, they said, \"We'll debate Joe Biden.\" you know, That thing got tremendous ratings too. That was crazy. But, \"We'll debate Joe Biden, but you can't have a crowd.\" They also wanted sitting down. I said, \"That's the only thing—\" I said, \"Look, you gotta, you got to stand up. You can't really sit down.\" In the old days, they did sit down a little bit.\nBut you got to stand up. And they agreed to it. It was a very tough thing, it almost killed it. They wanted to, they wanted to have desks, we sit. I said, \"I think we should stand up.\" And that was the only thing I asked for. I said, \"We gotta stand up.\" I, I thought it looked bad for like the public. But they said, \"No crowd, and cut off the mic.\" And I said, \"I can live with it. I mean, I can live with it.\" And they thought I was gonna reject it. And then they would say, \"He didn't want to debate Sleepy Joe.\" That's what they thought was gonna happen.\nNo, by the way, with her, number one, I'm leading. Number two—you know, They also said it with the primary. So I had like 10, 12 guys in the primary. No stupid guys. I mean, they're governors and they're senators, they're not stupid people. Some are stupid, but not all of them. And all my guys said, \"You have to be in the debate. I said, \"Why? I'm leading by 74 points. The closest guy to me, I'm, I'm like 60 points, 70 points higher. Why would I stand there like an idiot for two hours and let every one of them scream at me? I'm gonna be the focus.\" And I said, \"I'm not debating.\" And it was a very smart thing because you know, it was, they just killed themselves.\nYeah, the Republican primaries. uh, I like debating. I think, I think you have to debate. But I like debating—\nI like debating like the Rosie O'Donnell debate. I like debating when you have a crowd. Remember that Rosie O'Donnell thing?\nIt was crazy thing. Megyn. That was a hell of a question, man. If I didn't come up with that answer, I was done.\nWell, what it was is, you know, that is, we had 28,000 people. That was the Cleveland Arena where the Cavaliers played. LeBron James, I'm not a big fan of LeBron James, but he is a good basketball player. But, you know, and when I said that, the place went crazy.\nAnd she's kept talking. No, she had 10 other—the names—\nIt was fine.\nIt was lucky I did, it because she was drown—Oh, she wasn't finished, that question—but she kept talking, but you couldn't hear. To this day, they don't know what she said, but it wasn't positive. So anyway, but we had a good time. I think it's important.\nWell, how did I do with the Al Smith dinner?\nI got very good reviews on that.\nI got good reviews.\nTim Walz, yeah.\nThat's a real beauty.\nOkay, look, let's see how it all turns out. I think we're gonna win. I think we're way ahead now. I think we're way ahead. But, but—\nBut if they lose, I think, I think they're gonna look at two things. They're gonna say they should have had a primary, even if it was a short primary, they shouldn't have picked her. And then she's gonna say, \"I shouldn't have picked this guy.\"\nThat guy's a disaster.\nEverything.\nBut she lied too. She lied too.\nLittle thing, so I did McDonald's last week.\nAnd I actually got a call from your friends at Google, from Sundar. That's pretty good, right? He said, \"This is the biggest thing we've had in years,\" the hits.\nAt McDonald's. Did you know that? It was one of the—\nWho's a great guy, by the way. But he said, \"This McDonald's thing, I want to tell you, it's one of the biggest things we've ever had on Google.\" It just hit. But the reason I did it, and I actually—You never know about this stuff. I thought it was a throwaway. I didn't think our conversation's a throwaway, but I thought that was. I thought I'd walk in. And that was only to highlight the fact—and I have a friend, he owns like 56 of these McDonald's, and he said, \"Do you want to use one?\" I said, \"Yeah, I love it.\" So we went there and the crowd was crazy. you know, They had 28,000 people around the whole thing. Did you see the outside? It was crazy. The cars couldn't get through. Secret Service was not exactly thrilled. Had no idea what the hell—But I went into the place and I did the French fry thing, and it just hit. But that's like in life, sometimes you do—I thought it was like a quick throwaway, we're gonna be there for 15 minutes. Then I said, \"I've worked here for 15 minutes, which is 15 minutes more than she worked here.\" She lied about McDonald's. And those—\n100%. Well, McDonald's has no information. No—she has no information. There's nobody. The manager said she'd never worked there. you know, It was a certain place, and he said they never—No, she lied. She's a liar. You know what they do? They'll say like on any one of the questions, take any one, they'll say—It's the exact opposite of what I say. IVF, \"He's against IVF,\" the fertilization. And it's the exact opposite. I was, I came out immediately strongly in favor. And they do ads. I'm against it, it's wrong. uh, On every single topic. And you know, she changed policies on 15. I've never seen a guy change, anybody change on more than one. you know, You can maybe get away with one. Her whole life, fracking, every single thing that she was for, uh, the confiscation of guns. She wants to confiscate, now she's saying everybody should have a gun. In fact, we're gonna get her a MAGA cap. I'm gonna send her a MAGA cap. But she's changed, and I don't think people are buying it. I don't think people are buying it.\nThat's true.\nYou know what I don't understand? I don't understand why—Okay, you have a wall or you have a—You know, I built 570 miles a wall. Everyone said—I built a lot of wall, exactly the stuff. But you have a border. What I don't understand is who would want people to come into our country from places unknown. Like sometimes they'll say about a fighter, \"From parts unknown,\" right?\nThe old days. Those are the old days. That's even before you. But who would want people to come in, pouring into our country, we don't know anything about 'em?\nOkay, it's a couple of theories. They hate our country; they're stupid; or they want to buy votes. It's one of those three things. They wanna—now, they are trying to get people registered who you know, don't even know what the country is.\nThey want to give them amnesty, they want to give them citizenship. Well, how about what happened—\n$200 billion, and that's a way low number, that's a way low. you know, It's interesting, New York has always been like sort of always like looking for money. They've spent $100 billion on this stuff. I don't know where they—And they're not getting the money from the federal government, it's crazy. And because the mayor came out and said, \"We can't live like this.\"\nHe got—by the way I called it, I said, \"He just got himself indicted.\" This group is stupid, but they're vicious. They're stupid people, but they're vicious people.\nI did.\nOh, I did. I have books on it. And by the way, books have been written on it. We have an author named Hemingway who is a great writer, she wrote a book on it. But many books have been written on it. There are books that are—What's happened is judges don't wanna touch it. They would say, \"You don't have standing.\" They didn't rule on the merits. They rule—the merits never got there. The judges didn't have what it took to turn over an election.\nSo Elon, Elon Musk, I think he said it public. I hope he did because I wouldn't want it to be the one to—but he's a really smart guy and he's a very good guy with computers, right? You'd say he speaks—\nAnybody that can land that 20 story building, and perfect and boom.\nHe's an amazing guy, who—He said to me that unless you have paper ballots, it can never be an honest election. That's a big statement.\nWe should go to paper ballots. you know, France did. They went to mail-in voting and it was all messed up.\nYou know the amazing thing with the machines? So we have the machines, they cost 10 times more. A paper ballot would cost 8%, and they make paper ballots, they're all watermarked and everything else. They're very sophisticated. But if you take a look, paper ballots, 8% the cost, and you're done by nine o'clock in the evening, right? Now we have these sophisticated machine that goes up to heaven, it goes all over the place and down and around, and they say, \"We'll need two weeks to figure out who da hell won the election.\nYeah, I do. I think it's very crooked. That's my opinion.\nWell, if I win, that'll be, this will be my last election. But I think I owe it to the country.\nBut I think I owe it to the country, we have to have fair elections.\nJimmy Carter was in charge of a commission, you know that, many years ago. And they put him and Scoop Jackson, and various Senators, distinguished people that were retired, and they came up with a report. And the report's primary finding was you cannot have mail-in ballots, because if it's a mail-in ballot—you know, I went to the voting booth the last time, whatever it was, and I walked in, in Palm Beach. And I walk in, and they know me. They say, \"Mr. President, could I see your identification?\" \"Yes.\" Boom, here's this, here's that. Everything. And then you sit and they watch you sign, and, you really, there's not a lot you can do.\nI mean, if you wanted to be dishonest, it's sort of beautiful. If instead of that I'm gonna send them a ballot, it has to go through the postal services. It has to go through a lot of people. They mail you, houses, that the house was demolished and the people have left. And, it, it's so bad. The one thing with Jimmy Carter, he had a very strong commission, it was no mail-in ballots. And we are the only one that does elections this way anymore, they've gotten away from them.\nThey used COVID to cheat.\nBut they used COVID to cheat. And the last election was a little bit of a, you couldn't even get security guys, big strong guys to watch. You know what, you'd call them. They'd call them and they'd say—they were afraid to go out. We were in the middle of COVID. We were in the middle of COVID, right smack in the middle, and they didn't want to die. you know, They didn't want to catch it. In a way, it was like a ghost town, and the whole thing—but mail-in ballots are a bad thing. Bad thing.\nBecause they want to cheat.\nOkay, but here's now the next step. Gavin Newscum [sic], one of the worst governors in the world, and I used to, frankly, I used to get along, but I don't get along with him because he's just too—It's just a whole con job. But Gavin Newscum [sic] the other day signed a bill that you are not allowed to ask a person, even ask them whether or not they have a voter ID.\nBecause they want to cheat.\nBut that's taking it to the next level. Now, you have ID. The Democrat National Convention, when they had it the last time. I saw, they had a sign, like a billboard, the name of the person, where they live, how they live, who the hell their boyfriends are, every single, it was—and a big picture, that's for their, they have an ID, a big ID. It was hanging like you were a prisoner. It wa—they had these massive cards, everything. And yet when it comes to the vote, in theory, the most important thing we do, okay, when you go to a grocery store, you give ID. But for a vote, it's supposed to be a sacred thing. And it should be a sacred thing, no voter ID, because they want to cheat.\nThere's no other way.\nYou know the funny thing, Joe, the Democrats, the people, they all think you should have it. In other words, you should have voter. If you go to the people, Mrs. Schwartz, Mrs. Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Jones. They say, \"Of course, yeah.\" Democrats, they say yes. It's the politicians that don't want it, like Schumer and these guys, they don't want it. Because they want to be able to cheat, because you know what? If they didn't have it, okay, who is gonna vote for somebody that wants open borders? Who's gonna vote for somebody that wants to have uh, men playing in women's sports?\nI have never had one person come up to me and say, \"President, you got to do something to allow men to play in women's sports.\" Have you ever? It's like I've never been called by a pollster. I told you my little theory on pollsters. I'm getting myself in trouble with some of these things, but I don't really care. Nobody's ever come up to me and said, \"We want to have men play in women's sports.\" And, you know, I had a funny thing at a property I own in California. I have a woman who's a very good athlete and she works there as a manager, and Brian Urlacher, the big uh, Chicago Bears, great player, you know, 10 time all star, I guess Hall of Fame, a great guy. Big strong guy. And she said, \"Oh, he's one of my favorite athletes. Can I have a picture?\" And I took a picture and I sent it. And I noticed she was the size of his leg, his leg was bigger than she was. And I put it out, \"Should men play in women's sport?\" The whole—it was just so ridiculous.\nBut who wants it? Now, unless you're gonna cheat in elections, you're never gonna get—Nobody wants it, I don't think anybody wants it. I've never—I've been told everything, some people want this. I don't know of anybody that wants open borders, nobody's ever come up to me and say, \"President, you've got to let the world come into our country.\" Now, if they won, so they have 21 million. I think it's much higher than that because you've got a ways, got a ways where they just walk in. They walk in by—And the other thing you have is human traffickers. You have traffickers and the traffic in women, and they're going wild, now. You know where you have to look? The trunk of cars, can you believe it? They put women in trunks, they'll put three women in a trunk. These people are savages. They're horrible. The worst people, the hu—and the kind of money they make on drugs they're almost making on trafficking now.\nAnd the thing that's made it hot is the internet. That's what, you know, you think of it almost as an ancient thing, but it's the internet. But who would want to have these things? Who would want to have—There's so many, the transgender operations, where they're allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn them into a male, to a female without parental consent. Who wants this? Does anybody want this? I've never heard of anyone, and I can go into 10 different things. The only way they get 'em is by no voter ID. You can't have voter ID, they don't wanna, they want to cheat. There's only one reason, because the voter ID is so basic, it's the most basic thing.\nWho would want this? They want it so they can cheat, because their policies are no good. Their poli—I'll tell you, they're very smart when it comes to that, they're very smart. Although they're not smart in terms of uh, politics in a way, because what do they have that people want? They really don't have. They give away a lot of healthcare, a lot of stuff, but for the most part, their policies are terrible. Their policy on military, she's running on a tax hike. She's gonna raise your taxes. You gotta hear this. We are gonna raise your taxes, and the people clap. But who is gonna win with her? All my life I grew up with politicians—lower taxes. She's politic, she's politicking in that we are gonna raise your taxes.\nI know, but it really doesn't work out.\nI know, but it doesn't work that way.\nWell, the problems are the rich people are gonna leave and they're gonna close up their companies, and then the other people aren't gonna have jobs. You know, that's what happens.\nBut, the whole—because you brought it up. I'll tell you what, we just, he's doing a very good job in Virginia, Glen Youngkin, I don't know if you like him, not like him.\nOh, you don't know him, the governor of Virginia? So, we have a case where they found thousands of illegal ballots. A judge just ruled that they have to be able to vote. Just happened today. Just before I walked in here I heard. A judge just ruled that you have to keep those people in. They're illegal, they're illegal votes. Now, I think they'll be overturned at the next court. One thing I found, because I had a couple of things that they get overturned a little bit, the system. Because the system, you have to hope that the appellate judges are honest, otherwise we don't have a country anymore. It's very important. But the whole thing with the legal ballots, it's got to be looked at. You gotta have—you have to have voter ID and you have to have additional ID. You have to have an ID that shows that you're a citizen of the country.\nThey don't want that either.\nuh, So I, I opened them up partially. I was met with, from good people. Look, I mean good people. People that were well-meaning, Mike Pompeo was one of them. He's a good person. uh, They called me, they said, \"Sarah would rather have you not.\" After, and I did open 'em, but I was asked by some people not to open 'em. There's a Martin Luther King file too, by the way, that they'd like to see. I don't know if you know, but there is that. But, but JFK in particular. So they called me, a lot of good people called me. People that I, that you would find reasonable people, and they asked me not to do it. So I said, \"Well, we'll close it for another time.\" But if I win, I'm gonna open them up, I'm just gonna open. Enough times.\nAddresses, people that are still living, there are people that are affected. uh, And there could be some national security reason that for, that I don't have to necessarily know about, but some very good talented people asked me not to do it. I opened it up, and then they said, \"Would it be possible for us to do that a different day?\"\nuh, I think it's gonna be just fine to open it, let me put it that way. I think it's fine. It's gonna be time. It's a cleansing, you know, it's really a cleansing. So I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it immediately, almost immediately upon entering office.\nWell, when there are living people, you generally tend not to want to do it, when people are still living.\nFor the government, and living people that were somehow involved in it. And you tend not to do that. But uh, it's time to open them. uh, I can't tell you whether or not they're gonna find anything of interest. And I did partially open, I think I've opened up 50%, but I was asked not to do it. And I, I thought that was a reasonable ask, but now I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it very soon. There's a lot of interest in it. There's a lot of interest in the people coming from space, you know.\nAnd I know you're interested in that too.\nA lot.\nYeah.\nI can tell.\nWell, based on Hunter Biden, I can say whatever the hell I want. But, no—but I interviewed a few people. It's never been my thing, I have to be honest. I have never been a believer. I have people that, Area 51 or whatever it is, I think it's the number one tourist attraction in the whole country or something. Area 51, in Las Vegas—do you know that, right?\nSo, anyway, but it's a big tourist thing. So I interviewed jet pilots that say they saw something. If you saw them, you'd love to have them in your studio.\nI don't believe his name, but I interviewed jet pilots that uh, were solid people, perfect. I mean, great pilots, great everything. And they said, \"We saw things, Sir, that were, were very strange. Like a round ball, but it wasn't a comet or a meteor, it was something. And it was going four times faster than an F-22,\" which is a very fast plane, you know. And it was round, uh, which is in theory a great shape.\nNo.\nA little bit. It's not a great interest for me, but it's a little interest. I get that question as much as almost any question, do you think that we have aliens coming, you know, flying around or whatever?\nThere's no reason not to. I mean, there's no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don't have life. you know,\nWell, maybe it's life that we don't know, but maybe it's a different kind of life.\nIt's not been a big thing for me. When I looked at what China did to this admin—they would've never done it with me, where they put the balloon up. And a lot of people thought, a lot of people thought for a little while that that was one of these things.\nThey could be also.\nBut I did interview, let's say three or four guys, that, and without tremendous interest, if you had them, as I said, you'd love to have them as your children. Solid beautiful people. They said, \"Sir, there's something there.\"\nThey're not conspiracy guys.\nThat's tough to beat.\nWhen you fly in some of these jets, these pilots have to be in great shape.\nAnd those are older machines.\nWhen you fly in some of these things, it's amazing.\nBut you got to be special.\nI think, I think I had a great relationship with the military basically, but you know, I didn't like certain people. I would've gotten them out if I thought—if I were—if the election was different, I would've fired you know, all of them quickly. Some, most of them I did fire. Biden should have fired every military person involved with Afghanistan, he should have had a lot of firings. you know, If you look at him, he told Israel not to do anything, and at least Israel's not gonna look at it in a bomb the way they would've been. I think if they listened to Biden, they'd be waiting for a bomb to drop on their head right now. He's been wrong about so much. I guess you'd have to say that she's been wrong too, because you know, they said, she always said they made the decision together. But uh, Israel didn't follow his advice, and I think it was a, uh, I think—and the Middle East is rapidly changing.\nyou know, There are Prophets that say the world will come to an end in the Middle East, you know that, right? And we have weapons today that are so scary when you look, I rebuilt them all. And when you look at the weapons we have today, the biggest threat we have in the world today is nuclear weapons. And we have other weapons too that are devastating, but the nuclear weapons, the biggest threat we have in the world today. And that's what—you—I was talking about de-escalation with both China and Russia. I'm telling you, we were gonna de-escalate, they were gonna de-escalate. You got to be careful, it's a little tricky playing with them. Because they say, \"We're gonna do it,\" and they don't do it, maybe. But they understood the curse too, it's a curse. It, uh, China's way behind us, but they'll catch us within five years.\nWell, it's a very, uh, to me it's an easy question, because I think I can do it easily, but it's a complex question in the sense that the times change, every day changes. uh, Who's winning, who's not winning? I mean, Russia's a war machine, whether you like it or not, it just grinds along, grinds along. You speak to people like Viktor Orban, he'll tell you, it's just a big fat war machine, and that's what's happening. You look at what's happened to Ukraine, if I were there, it would've never happened.\nRight now, right now, right now, you would get both of them. I know both very well. And, and again, I cannot, I do not want to tell you for the purpose of looking smart to five people that you know, say, \"Oh, he was great.\" Because if I told you exactly what I'd do, I could, I could never make the deal. All I can tell you is that I would meet with Putin and I would meet with him, and I know exactly what I'd say to each one of them. And I believe that as President-elect, I would get that war stopped and stopped fast. you know, We have tremendous power in the United States if you know how to use the power. I stopped other wars just by the use of tariffs. I got Macron of France, good guys, like a friend of mine, but he's a wise guy. And he's a person that likes France, and he was gonna tax our companies. And I say, I sent all the smartest guys. I sent Mnuchin, they all failed me. And I said, \"I'll do it myself.\"\nAnd I called him, I said, \"Emmanuel, you're taxing American companies. We're not gonna allow you to do that.\" \"Oh, Donald, I cannot do—nothing I could do. It's already been passed.\" I said, \"Emmanuel, if you do that, I'm gonna put 100% tariff on your wines and champagnes that come in to the United States, and you're gonna regret that you ever did it.\" He said, \"Donald, please, that's not fair.\" Anyway, within about two minutes he dropped the whole thing, and it was massive amounts of money against American companies. I have to protect American companies.\nBecause they're incompetent, they don't know how to talk. Look, they met in Alaska with uh, the Chinese, and the Chinese lectured them about how badly we treat people. Right? Okay, think of it. You remember that day? It was like in a—they didn't talk to me that way. They never—they respected me. They respected our country. They don't respect our country. They don't respect Biden, they don't respect her. They're dreaming about her because she's incompetent. She's not a smart person. Look, she can't put two sentences together. She talks, I watched her two nights. I watched her last night too, it was the same thing. She's not a smart person. These guys are very smart and they're very streetwise, and they're very tricky and evil and dangerous. And if she becomes the President of the United States, which I can't believe can happen, I don't think this country is gonna make it. I don't think we'll ever be—I think, I think just really bad things will happen to our country.\nAnd you know what? I look at the outside forces and I say they can all be handled, because we have a pot of gold, but we're not gonna have that pot of gold to play with anymore. you know, It's a great negotiating thing. I told you, I knocked out this massive car company, gonna take all of our car business from Detroit. I knocked it out just by my rhetoric, rhetorically I said, \"They'll never sell a car in here. I'll put tariffs. I don't care they're 2000%, they're never gonna build that plant.\"\nYeah.\nAnd the chips.\nYou do it, but let me just say, that chip deal is so bad. We put up billions of dollars for rich companies to come in and borrow the money and build chip companies here, and they're not gonna give us the good companies anyway. All you had to do is charge them tariffs. If you would've put a tariff on the chips coming in, you would've been able to, just like the auto companies, no different. More sophisticated, but no different. you know, Taiwan, they stole our chip business. Okay? They want us to protect and they want protection, they don't pay us money for the protection, you know. The mob makes you pay money, right? But with these countries that we protect, I got hundreds of billions of dollars from NATO countries that were never paying us. And my biggest fan is Stoltenberg, who just left as the Director General, as a Secretary General, good guy.\nHe said, \"Bush came, he made a speech. Obama came, he made a speech. Trump came, he said, you guys aren't paying. You gotta pay.\" And they said, \"Will you protect us from Russia if we don't?\" I said, \"No, you got to pay. If you don't pay—\" Billions of dollars came in to NATO. When I see us paying a lot of money to have people build chips, that's not the way. You didn't have to put up 10 cents, you could have done it with a series of tariffs. In other words, you tariff it so high that they will come and build their chip companies for nothing. In other words, Joe, you put a big tariff on the chips coming in. I say, \"You don't have to pay the tariff, all you have to do is build your plant in the United States.\" We didn't have to give them the money to build the plant, besides that, they're very rich companies. These chip companies, they stole. They stole 95% of our business, it's in Taiwan right now.\nThey do a great job, but that's only because we have stupid politicians. We lost the chip business, and now we think we're gonna pay. You can't build it that way. You have to make them spend their money in the United States, and those plants would open up all over. And they'll fund them, we don't have to put up 10 cents. I am in the process of making a huge speech in about a little while, and you and I, how long have we been talking?\nLet's go.\nI got to make a speech, but we'll do it again. I want to do it again with you. You are something.\nI said, \"How long will this last?\" Anywhere from an hour to three or four hours.\nGood. Well, we'll do it again. I thought it was great.\nYou are a fascinating guy and you've done a great job.\nI'm a big fan, and thank you very much. It's been an honor.\nI'm gonna make a great speech and I'm gonna say, and if I'm a little off tonight, I'm gonna blame you.\nI'm gonna say, \"I spoke to this guy for three hours.\" Anyway, it's a great honor to be with you.\nThank you.\nThank you very much.\nAppreciate it.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-the-joe-rogan-experience"}
{"Title": "Inaugural Address", "Date": "2025-01-20", "Text": "Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. [Applause] Wow. Thank you very, very much.\nVice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens: The golden age of America begins right now.\nFrom this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\nOur sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our Government will end.\nAnd our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.\nI return to the Presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before.\nBut first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America.\nAs we gather today, our Government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair.\nWe now have a Government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad.\nIt fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens, but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world.\nWe have a Government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people.\nOur country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina—who have been treated so badly—and other States who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They're raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country, some of whom are sitting here right now. They don't have a home any longer. That's interesting. But we can't let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That's going to change.\nWe have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world.\nAnd we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves, in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly.\nMy recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America's decline is over.\nOur liberties and our Nation's glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America's Government.\nOver the past 8 years, I have been tested and challenged more than any President in our 250-year history, and I've learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our Republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life.\nJust a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nThat is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.\nFor American citizens, January 20, 2025, is liberation day. It is my hope that our recent Presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country.\nAs our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing States—[applause]—and the popular vote, we won by millions of people.\nTo the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I've heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come.\nToday is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor—this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nNational unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. [Applause] Can't do that.\nToday I will sign a series of historic Executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It's all about common sense.\nFirst, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my \"Remain in Mexico\" policy.\nI will end the practice of catch-and-release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\nAnd by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our Government to use the full and immense power of Federal and State law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\nAs Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.\nNext, I will direct all members of my Cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill.\nAmerica will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have, the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth, and we are going to use it. We'll use it.\nWe will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it.\nWith my actions today, we will end the \"green new deal,\" and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. In other words, you'll be able to buy the car of your choice.\nWe will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our Nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote.\nI will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.\nFor this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\nTo restore competence and effectiveness to our Federal Government, my administration will establish the brandnew Department of Government Efficiency.\nAfter years and years of illegal and unconstitutional Federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an Executive order to immediately stop all Government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\nNever again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents, something I know something about. [Laughter] We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again. Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities.\nThis week, I will also end the Government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based. As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States Government that there are only two genders: male and female.\nThis week, I will reinstate any servicemembers who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full backpay.\nAnd I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It's going to end immediately. Our Armed Forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America's enemies.\nLike in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end and, perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.\nMy proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That's what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier. I'm pleased to say that as of yesterday, 1 day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. [Applause] Thank you.\nAmerica will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world.\nA short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and we will restore the name of a great President, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs.\nPresident McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent—he was a natural businessman—and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United States—the United States—I mean, think of this—spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal.\nWe have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama's promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.\nAnd above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\nAbove all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history's greatest civilization.\nSo, as we liberate our Nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free.\nThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons.\nAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\nAmbition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our Nation is more ambitious than any other. There's no nation like our Nation.\nAmericans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls.\nOur American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.\nAmericans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve.\nMany people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best.\nFrom New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, DC, our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.\nThey were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride.\nTogether, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced.\nAfter all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the 4 greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love, and we love it so much.\nWe are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We're going to win like never before. [Applause] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nIn recent years, our Nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable.\nAmerica will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and good will. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before.\nWe will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation.\nWe will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun.\nThank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/inaugural-address-54"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel", "Date": "2025-02-04", "Text": "Thank you very much.\nThat's a lot of press. Congratulations. You bring them out. [Laughter]\nYou really bring them out.\nToday, I'm delighted to welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu back to the White House. It's a wonderful feeling and a wonderful event. We had fantastic talks—and thank you very much—with your staff.\nHe's the first foreign head of state to visit during our administration. And, Bibi, I want to say, it's an honor to have you with us. Over the past 4 years, the U.S. and the Israeli alliance has been tested more than any time in history, but the bonds of friendship and affection between the American and Israeli people have endured for generations, and they are absolutely unbreakable. They are unbreakable.\nI'm confident that, under our leadership, the cherished alliance between our two countries will soon be stronger than ever. We had a great relationship. We had great victories together four years ago. Not so many victories over the past four years, however.\nIn my first term, Prime Minister and I forged a tremendously successful partnership that brought peace and stability to the Middle East like it hadn't seen in decades.\nTogether, we defeated ISIS, we ended the disastrous Iran nuclear deal—one of the worst deals ever made, by the way—and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the Iranian regime. We starved Hamas and Iran's other terrorist proxies, and we starved them like they had never seen before—resources and support disappeared for them.\nI recognized Israel's capital; opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem, and got it built, by the way—built it too, just—not only designated it but got it built at a price that nobody has seen for 40 years. We got it built. It's beautiful, all Jerusalem stone, right from nearby, and it was—it's something that's very special. And recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something that they talked about for 70 years and they weren't able to get it. And I got it.\nAnd with the historic Abraham Accords—something that was really an achievement that was, I think, going to become more and more important, because we achieved the most significant Middle East peace agreements in half a century—but the Abraham Accords, in particular. And I really believe that many countries will soon be joining this amazing peace and economic development transaction. It really is a big economic development transaction. I think we're going to have a lot of people signing up very quickly.\nUnfortunately, for 4 years, nobody signed up. Nobody did anything for 4 years, except in the negative—unfortunately, the weakness and incompetence of those years, those past 4 years—the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East—grave damage all over the globe.\nThe horrors of October 7 would never have happened if I were President. The Ukraine and Russia disaster would never have happened if I were President.\nOver the past 16 months, Israel has endured a sustained, aggressive, and murderous assault on every front, but they've fought back bravely. You see that, and you know that. What we have witnessed is an all-out attack on the very existence of a Jewish state in the Jewish homeland.\nThe Israelis have stood strong and united in the face of an enemy that has kidnapped, tortured, raped, and slaughtered innocent men, women, children, and even little babies. I want to salute the Israeli people for meeting this trial with courage and determination and unflinching resolve. They have been strong.\nIn our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I focused on the future, discussing how we can work together to ensure Hamas is eliminated and ultimately restore peace to a very troubled region. It's been troubled, but what's happened in the last four years has not been good.\nI want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for working closely with my transition team; the Special Envoy, Steve Witkoff, who is here somewhere. Steve. Stand up, Steve, please. What a job you have done. What a good job you've done. Proud of you. Done a fantastic job. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Thank you, Mike, for working so well with us. Thank you.\nWe have, in addition, Marco Rubio, who is on the phone right now, listening to every single word that we say—[laughter]—and he's going to be great. And, Pete, congratulations. And, Scott, congratulations. I see you're here. And Karoline has been doing a great job. She's, really, probably talked about more than anybody here. [Laughter] She's done a fantastic job. And thank you very much, Karoline. We're proud of you.\nBut we'll only be satisfied when all of these problems are solved. And we have the team to solve them, and that's going to happen, and it's going to happen, I think, very quickly.\nI also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been a symbol of death and destruction for so many decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, and especially those who live there—and frankly, who's been really very unlucky—it's been very unlucky; it's been an unlucky place for a long time—being in its presence just has not been good, and it should not go through a process of rebuilding and occupation by the same people that have really stood there and fought for it and lived there and died there and lived a miserable existence there.\nInstead, we should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts—and there are many of them that want to do this—and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and, frankly, bad luck.\nThis could be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. It could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site. But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace, and we'll get sure—we'll make sure something really spectacular is done. They're going to have peace. They're not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilization of wonderful people has had to endure.\nThe only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is, they have no alternative. It's right now a demolition site. This is just a demolition site. Virtually, every building is down. They're living under fallen concrete that's very dangerous and very precarious.\nThey instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety, and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony, instead of having to go back and do it again.\nThe U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site, and get rid of the destroyed buildings. Level it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\nJust can't go back. If you go back, it's going to end up the same way it has for a hundred years. I'm hopeful that this cease-fire could be the beginning of a larger and more enduring peace that will end the bloodshed and killing once and for all.\nWith the same goal in mind, my administration has been moving quickly to restore trust in the alliance and rebuild American strength throughout the region, and we've really done that. We're a respected nation again. A lot has happened in the last couple of weeks. We are actually a—we're very respected nation again.\nI ended the last administration's de facto arms embargo on over $1 billion in military assistance for Israel. And I'm also pleased to announce that this afternoon, the United States withdrew from the anti-Semitic U.N. Human Rights Council and ended all of the support for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which funneled money to Hamas and which was very disloyal to humanity.\nToday I also took action to restore a maximum-pressure policy on the Iranian regime. And we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports to zero, and diminish the regime's capacity to fund terror throughout the region and throughout the world.\nWe had no threat when I left office. Iran was not able to sell oil. Nobody was buying oil because I said: \"Don't buy it. If you buy it, you're not doing any business with the United States.\" And Hamas was not being funded. Hizballah was not being funded. Nobody was being funded. There would never have been an October 7.\nTwo weeks ago, I once again designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization. They're trying to destroy world shipping lanes, and that's not going to happen. And over the weekend, I ordered air strikes against senior ISIS leaders hiding in the caves of Somalia and took them out.\nHere in America, we've begun the process of deporting foreign terrorists, jihadists, and Hamas sympathizers from our soil, just as we have people that are extremely evil, and we're sending them out of our country. They came from jails, they came from mental institutions and insane asylums, and they were dumped into our country. They're gang members. We're getting them out at numbers that nobody can actually believe.\nAnd every single country is taking those people back. They said they would never take them back, and they're all taking them back. And they're taking them back very gladly.\nAnd I recently signed an executive order combating the vile wave of anti-Semitism that we've seen in the aftermath of the October 7 attacks.\nTogether, America and Israel will renew the optimism that shined so brightly just four years ago. It was really a bright, beautiful light. We will restore calm and stability to the region and expand prosperity, opportunity, and hope to our nations and for all people of the Middle East, including the Arab and Muslim nations. Very important. We want the Arab and Muslim nations to have peace and have tranquility and have great lives.\nI'd like to now invite Prime Minister Netanyahu to say a few words, and we'll take some questions afterwards.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much, Bibi. Very nice. Thank you.\nAnd J.D. Vance, everybody. J.D., please. Vice President, stand up. He's been doing a good job. He's been working very hard on all things, but this in particular.\nWe'll take some questions, please.\n[At this point, several reporters began speaking at once.]\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead, please. Go ahead.\nYes, go ahead.\nSo Saudi Arabia is going to be very helpful, and they have been very helpful. They want peace in the Middle East. It's very simple. We know their leader and their leaders very well. They're wonderful people, and they want peace in the Middle East.\nAs far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that. We're going to take over that piece, and we're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it will be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.\nBut everybody feels that continuing the same process that's gone on forever, over and over again, and then it starts, and then the killing starts, and all of the other problems start, and you end up in the same place, and we don't want to see that happen.\nSo, by the United States, with its stability and strength, owning it—especially the strength that we're developing and developed over the last fairly short period of time—I would say, really since the election—I think we'll be a great keeper of something that is very, very strong, very powerful, and very, very good for the area—not just for Israel, for the entire Middle East—very important.\nAnd we'll, again, have thousands of jobs. And there will be jobs for everyone, not for a specific group of people, but for everybody.\nOkay, please.\nIt's true—many, many more. I agree, many more nations.\nYes, please, go ahead.\nWell, I can't tell you whether or not the cease-fire will hold. We've done, I think, a very masterful job. And we weren't helped very much by the Biden administration, I can tell you that.\nBut we've gotten quite a few hostages out. We're going to get more out. But we're dealing with very complex people, and we are going to see whether or not it holds. We certainly want to have more come out. They've come out damaged—in many ways, damaged—very damaged people, but they're going to get better, and they're going to be strong, and they're going to have a good life. And we hope to get as many as possible out.\nWhether or not it holds, I don't know. We hope it holds. We hope it holds.\nKelly [Kelly O'Donnell, NBC News]. Kelly, go ahead, please.\nI do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East. And everybody I've spoken to—this was not a decision made lightly. Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in a really magnificent area that nobody would know. Nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over. It's just a terrible sight.\nI've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different angle. And it's a very, very dangerous place to be, and it's only going to get worse.\nAnd I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous—and I'm talking about from the highest level of leadership—gotten tremendous praise. And if the United States can help to bring stability and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that.\nYes, please, go ahead. Go ahead.\nYes.\nWe're working very hard to get all the hostages. The word is \"all,\" and we are working very hard. So far, it's been moving along fairly rapidly, pretty much on schedule. It's—I'd love to have them all out at one time, but we're taking them out.\nAnd tomorrow, more are being released, and over the days more, and then we'll go into a phase two. But we'd like to get all of the hostages.\nAnd if we don't, it will just make us somewhat more violent, I will tell you that, because they would have broken their word.\nWell, we're discussing that with many of your representatives. You're represented very well, and people do like the idea, but we haven't taken a position on it yet, but we will be—we'll be making an announcement probably on that very specific topic over the next 4 weeks.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please. Please.\nIt doesn't mean anything about a two-state or a one-state or any other state. It means that we want to have—we want to give people a chance at life. They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It's been horrible. The Hamas has made it so bad—so bad, so dangerous, so unfair to people.\nAnd by doing what I'm recommending that we do, it's a recommendation—a very strong recommendation—but it is a strong recommendation—by doing that, we think we're going to bring perhaps great peace to long beyond this area.\nAnd I have to stress, this is not for Israel. This is for everybody in the Middle East—Arabs, Muslims. This is for everybody. This would be where they can partake in terms of jobs and living and all of the other benefits. And I think it's very important.\nIt just doesn't work the other way. You know, you can't keep trying. They just—has been going along for so many decades, you can't even count. You just can't keep doing—you have to learn from history. You can't keep doing the same mistake over and over again.\nGaza is a hellhole right now. It was before the bombing started, frankly, and we're going to give people a chance to live in a beautiful community that's safe and secure. And I think you're going to see tremendous—a tremendous outflowing of support.\nI can tell you, I spoke to other leaders of countries in the Middle East, and they love the idea. They say it would really bring stability, and what we need is stability.\nYes, sir, please.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead.\nGo ahead, Bibi.\nYes, ma'am. Go ahead.\nI have a little hard time understanding you. Where are you from?\nOh, actually, it's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. The only problem is, I can't understand a word you're saying. [Laughter]\nBut—but I just say this: Good luck. Live in peace.\nGo ahead, please.\nIran/U.S. Sanctions\nThat's okay. Yes, please.\nYes.\nI hated doing it. I want Iran to be peaceful and successful. I hated doing it. I did it once before, and we brought them down to a level where they were unable to give any money. They had to survive themselves, and they had no money. They were essentially broke, and they had no money for, as I said, Hizballah. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for any form of terror—the 28—if you call it, the 28 sites of terror. They had no money for any of it.\nThey had to do their own and focus on their own well-being. And I hated to do it then, and I hate it—I hate to do it just as much now.\nAnd I say this, and I say this to Iran, who is listening very intently: I would love to be able to make a great deal, a deal where you can get on with your lives, and you'll do wonderfully. You'll do wonderfully.\nIncredible people—industrious, beautiful, just an unbelievable group of people in Iran. And I know them well. I have many friends from Iran and many friends that are Americans from Iran, and they're very proud of Iran.\nBut I hated to do it, just so you understand. And I hope we're going to be able to do something so that it doesn't end up in a very catastrophic situation. I don't want to see that happen. I want to see——\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nI really want to see peace, and I hope that we're able to do that.\nThey cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple. I'm not putting restrictions. I'm not—they cannot have—one thing: They cannot have a nuclear weapon.\nAnd if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, that—I think that's going to be very unfortunate for them.\nIf, on the other hand, they can convince us that they won't, and I hope they can—it's very easy to do; it's actually very easy to do—I think they're going to have an unbelievable future.\nYes, please. Sir, go ahead.\nYes.\nFor Ukraine?\nSo we're dealing right now on the subject—I don't want to spend a lot of time because we're here for another reason—but we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. And we're talking to the Russians. We're talking to the Ukrainian leadership.\nIt would have never happened. That would have never happened—it should have never happened. I get reports every week: the number of soldiers—mostly soldiers now. The cities have been largely demolished. You talk about a very sad sight to see.\nWe talk Gaza. Well, many of these cities look as bad as Gaza and worse—what's happened to them—and I want to see that end.\nAnd I want to see it end for one simple reason: the life of young people being absolutely obliterated on both sides. You probably have 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, 800,000—maybe more—Russian soldiers dead. It's very flat land, and the only thing that's going to stop a bullet is a human body—in this case, usually soldiers.\nAnd the numbers are staggering, when you hear the real numbers in Ukraine, what the numbers are, and this doesn't include the cities that have been demolished and all of the people that were killed. So I want to see it stopped.\nWe're having very good talks, and I think we're going to get it. I think something will be, hopefully, dramatically—it will—it will rise above everything. You have to. You can't let this continue. You can't—this is an absolute slaughter that's taking place on the beautiful farmlands of Ukraine, and we have to stop it. We can't let this continue.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nIt's a human—it's a human—it is a human tragedy, and we're going to try very hard to stop it.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nYes, please. Go ahead, sir. Go ahead.\nGo ahead, Bibi. Go ahead.\nWell, I said it, and he said it very well. It's a—it's a campaign of pressure to see if we can get something done. He doesn't want to do what some people think will automatically happen, because they're very difficult people to deal with, as you know.\nBut if we could solve this problem without warfare, without all of the things that you've been witnessing over the last number of years, it would be—I think it would be a tremendous thing.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please.\nTo visit where?\nOh, well, I love—I love Israel. I will visit there and I'll visit Gaza and I'll visit Saudi Arabia, and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East. The Middle East is an incredible place—so vibrant, so—it's just one of the really beautiful places and the—with great people.\nAnd I think a lot of bad leadership has taken place in the Middle East that's allowed this to happen. It's just terrible—and that includes on the American side, by the way. We should have never gone in there a long time ago, spent trillions of dollars, and created so much death, so—and that includes Americans.\nBut yes, I'll be visiting a lot of different places in the Middle East. I've been invited everywhere, but I will be visiting some. Yes.\nKaitlan [Kaitlan Collins, CNN], go ahead. Kaitlan.\nKaitlan, go ahead.\nSay it? Go ahead, please.\nI envision world people living there—the world's people. I think you'll make that into an international, unbelievable place. I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. And I think the entire world—representatives from all over the world will be there, and they'll——\n——and they'll live there. Palestinians, also. Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there.\nBut they've tried the other, and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. It's not going to work. It didn't work. It will never work. And you have to learn from history. History has—you know, you just can't let it keep repeating itself.\nWe have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal—and I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy—but the Riviera of the Middle East. This could be something that could be so——\n——this could be so magnificent.\nBut more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed—that live there now—can live in peace in a much better situation, because they are living in hell. And those people will now be able to live in peace. We'll make sure that it's done world class. It will be wonderful for the people—Palestinians——\n——Palestinians, mostly, we're talking about. And I have a feeling that—despite them saying no, I have a feeling that the King in Jordan and the general, President—but that the general in Egypt will open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done, and people can live in harmony and in peace.\nThank you all very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-israel-0"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan", "Date": "2025-02-07", "Text": "Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. It's a great honor to be with the Prime Minister. We had a picture taken a little while ago. And it was so nice, I thought I'd present it to you on stage, and here's the picture.\nAudience member.Ahh.\nI wish I was as handsome as him, but I'm not. [Laughter]\n[At this point, the President gave the Prime Minister a photograph.]\nWe remember that day.\nThank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it.\nI'm delighted to welcome Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru to the White House for the first time. And, Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us, a great honor. Japan is a great country. Thank you very much.\nJapan is strong and proud. It's a nation that is home to one of the great civilizations in the history of the world. For nearly 80 years, the American-Japanese people have enjoyed a friendship like few others—we've had a great friendship—across a vast ocean. And we found ourselves united by bonds of history, commerce, culture, mutual admiration, and great respect.\nAfter our meeting today, I'm confident that the cherished alliances between our two countries—and others, also—will continue to flourish long and into the future.\nThe military cooperation between the United States and Japan is one of our closest security partnerships, and it's one of the closest we have anywhere in the world. Our servicemembers work together every day to defend our common interests.\nJapan has committed to double its defense spending by 2027, compared to my first term. They've invested a lot of money because of my first term. We worked on that very hard with Shinzo—you know, the great Shinzo Abe. And we look forward to seeing even more so. Shinzo and I worked very, very long and hard, and those numbers are very reflective, after my first term. And now they're going up very substantially based on our conversations today.\nIn addition to being vital for our shared security, Japan is one of the top purchasers of U.S. military exports and equipment. And I'm pleased to say that, this week, my administration approved nearly a billion dollars in foreign military sales to Tokyo.\nThe United States is totally committed to the security of Japan. We will extend the full strength of American deterrence capabilities in defense of our friend and ally, hundred percent.\nIn the years to come, the Prime Minister and I will be working closely together to maintain peace and security—and I also say peace through strength—and all over the Indo-Pacific. And to that end, we also remain committed to the effort I began in my first term to ensure safety and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\nPrime Minister Ishiba and I spoke long and hard about a vital economic relationship between our two countries and the continuance of that relationship. The United States and Japan trade over $300 billion in goods and services each year. Japan has invested nearly $800 billion—and that's going to go up very, very substantially in the coming months—more than any other country.\nAnd they're going to have some competition. We have a lot of people coming in and investing in the United States. I think our—the feeling throughout the world has never been stronger about this country.\nAs a result of our victory in 2024, the Presidential election, the Japanese investment and technology giant SoftBank announced plans to invest between $100 and $200 billion. We have many other companies investing that number, higher than that number. Some, a little bit less. But we have trillions of dollars of investment pouring into our country now that you didn't have just a short while ago.\nToday our teams discussed how our two Nations can do even more to stay on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, along with the quantum computing, semiconductors, and other critical technologies—and they're coming out. The problem with technology, that kind: It's obsolete in about 2 days, so we have to start all over again. Doesn't last long.\nWe agreed to cooperate even more closely to combat the Chinese economic aggression, which is quite aggressive.\nI'm also pleased to announce that Japan will soon begin importing historic new shipments of clean American liquefied natural gas in record numbers. It will be record numbers.\nWith our Secretary of the Interior, we were talking—I think Doug is here. Hello, Doug. Please stand up, Doug. Doug Burgum, everybody.\nWe're talking about the pipeline in Alaska, which is the closest point of major oil and gas to Japan by far, less than half the distance of any other location. We're talking about a joint venture of some type between Japan and us, having to do with Alaska oil and gas, and that's very exciting. They're very excited about it. So are we.\nAs we deepen our economic relationship, I made clear that the United States will be conducting trade with all countries based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity. Chronic trade deficits not only undermine our economy—they really do, and we're going to get rid of the trade—we have a trade deficit with Japan of over $100 billion. But we're going to work that out, and I think very quickly. Frankly, we can do it just on oil and gas. We can work it out. So we intend to do it very quickly. We both understand that.\nAnd as America welcomes new foreign investment, we also want to ensure that companies build their products and factories here in America, not simply by the assets that we have.\nAnd Japan is going to be opening up auto plants. New auto plants are being built, currently as we speak. They've just been started. Toyota is one, and Nissan is going to be doing something very exciting about—about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase.\nWe didn't like the idea. U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years many years ago—80 years ago—and we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave, but the concept—psychologically, not good.\nSo they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel, as opposed to own it. And that sounds very exciting. And we're going to meet with Nissan next week, the head of Nissan—a very great company—and they'll work out the details. I'll help. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate.\nAnd I had the privilege of working closely with the great Prime Minister—as you know, and you knew him very well—Shinzo Abe, the longest serving Prime Minister in Japan's history. Likewise, I expect that this Prime Minister is going to be a great one.\nI really believe that. He's going to be a great one. I've gotten to know him for not long, but I can see what they have. He's got—he's got the qualities of greatness. He's going to do a fantastic job for Japan and for the Japanese people.\nAnd I'd like now to invite the Prime Minister to say a few words, and then we'll take some questions.\nThank you very much. Thank you.\nAny questions, please? Peter [Peter Doocy, Fox News].\nWhite House Senior Adviser Elon R. Musk\nOh, I think she'll be okay with it somehow. [Laughter]\nWell, it doesn't, but they get it very easily. I mean, we don't have very good security in our country, and they get it very easily. And what we're doing, if you look at what has just taken place with respect to some of the investments that have been made on another agency that people have been talking about for years, but nobody did anything about it, it's absolutely obscene—dangerous, bad, very costly.\nI mean, virtually every investment made is a con job. There's nothing of value to anybody, unless there's a kickback scheme going on, which is possible.\nAnd we're going to be doing more and more and more of that. We're going to be looking at Department of Education. We're going to be looking at even our military. We're going to be looking at tremendous amounts of money, Peter, being spent on things that bear no relationship to anything and have no value.\nWe're talking about trillions of dollars. It will be, in the end, trillions of dollars being absolutely wasted and perhaps illegally—I would say, certainly, in many cases, illegally—but perhaps illegally overall.\nAnd I'm very proud of the job that this group of young people—generally, young people, but very smart people—they're doing. They're doing it at my insistence. It would be a lot easier not to do it, but we have to take some of these things apart to find the corruption. And we've found tremendous corruption.\nOh, I see the same ones. I see Maxine Waters, a lowlife. I see, you know, all these people. They don't—they don't love our country. They don't love our country. We want great education.\nSo they rank 40 countries in education. We're ranked dead last—dead last. But the good news is we're number one in one category. You know what that is? Cost per pupil. We spend more per pupil than on—any other country in the world. You look at Norway, Denmark, Sweden, various countries all up and down—Finland—China does very well in education—and then you look at us. We spend much more money than they do per pupil—or any other way, but we spend much more money than they do. And yet we're ranked, this year, last—Biden's last year—congratulations, Joe—we're ranked dead last.\nSo what I want to see is education. Number one, I like choice. We all like choice. But beyond choice—long beyond choice, I want to see it go back to the States, where great States that do so well—have no debt, they're operated brilliantly—they'll be as good as Norway or Denmark or Sweden or any of the other highly ranked countries. They'll be—you'll probably have 30—I figure 35 to 38 States will be right at the top, and the rest will come along. They'll have to come along, competitively.\nAnd by the way, we'll be spending a lot less money, and we'll have great education.\nWell, I don't know about the particular thing, but if the Vice President said that—did you say that?\nVice President James D. \"J.D.\" Vance. I did say that.\nI'm with the Vice President. [Laughter]\nThank you, Peter.\n[Several reporters began speaking at once.]\nWell, I want our military to be the strongest. I also don't mind spending so much money on the military, because we build it here. It's made in the U.S.A. All made in the U.S.A.\nWe have—you know, I rebuilt our military during my first term. Did a great job. We left some of it behind in Afghanistan, stupidly. There was no reason for that. But it was still—as much as it was—it was billions and billions of dollars, but it was a small part of it.\nBut we're going to have the strongest military by far. We have great people. I want to congratulate Pete Hegseth for having gone through the gauntlet. He went through a lot, but he got through, and he's going to be a tremendous—I have no doubt he's going to be a tremendous leader. And other of the leaders sitting here, they're—in their own fields, they're going to—we're going to do something very—very great, and we expect great things.\nBut I expect the strongest military, by far, in the world—far stronger than China, far stronger than anybody, and that's the way it is.\nThank you very much.\nWould you like to ask a question? Please. Go ahead.\nThank you.\nSure.\nJapan-U.S. Relations/U.S. Trade Policy\nI think that he is going to be a great Prime Minister. I think he's a very strong man—very, very strong. I have great respect for him. I've known him for a long time, through a reputation. Shinzo Abe thought the world of him, and I think he's going to do a fantastic job as Prime Minister.\nA very strong person. I wish he wasn't so strong. [Laughter] I wish he was a little bit weaker than that, but that's what I got. [Laughter] I have to get strong guys all the time. He's going to be a great Prime Minister.\nI also—in terms of tariffs, I mean, we're going to have tariffs. Mostly reciprocal tariffs, where we go with—and I'm going to be probably meeting on that Monday or Tuesday—have an announcement, probably a news conference. But probably reciprocal tariffs, where a country pays so much or charges us so much, and we do the same.\nSo very reciprocal, because I think that's the only fair way to do it. That way, nobody is hurt. They charge us. We charge them. It's the same thing. And I seem to be going in that line, as opposed to a flat fee tariff.\nYes, go. Please. Please, go ahead. Why don't you go ahead?\nThank you very much.\nGo ahead, please.\nYes.\nThey're doing it as an investment, no longer a purchase.\nI didn't want it purchased, but investment I love.\nAnd they're going to do a big investment, subject to getting the deal done. And they'll be doing a big——\nI'm okay with that, sure.\nWell, we didn't discuss tariffs too much. We really discussed many other things, including the pipeline in Alaska, which I think is going to be maybe the most exciting thing—with Doug and Chris. We discussed that at length, the pipeline. I mean, it seemed to be of great interest to them.\nIt's—we have potentially more oil and gas than in Saudi Arabia, just in Alaska. We have the most of any country in the world. It's a big asset for the United States, but we haven't used it.\nWe go to Venezuela, we go to other places to take oil and gas, and we have more than anybody. It's an amazing phenomenon that took place over the last 4 years. Nobody understands it, including the people that were in charge of it. They had no clue what they were doing. So it was a big problem.\nThey were surprised, actually, too. They were saying, \"Why? Why didn't they\"—They—they wouldn't sell them LNG. They wouldn't sell. Japan wanted to buy LNG, and Biden wouldn't sell it. And I'm trying to figure that one out. Maybe it was the environment.\nYou might answer that question. He's curious about that himself, I think.\nThank you very much.\nIf you want to answer that, you may—about LNG, that the United States wouldn't sell you LNG.\nI want to just say that, on the ethanol, Iowa is going to be very happy. All of the—Nebraska, all of our farm States are going to be very happy. They want ethanol, and we'll be able to provide it. So our farmers—who I like, and they like me—I think they're going to be very, very happy.\nWe've opened the sale of LNG immediately. Actually, we did it a few days ago. And China—and right now, not only China, everybody wants to buy it. We have more than anybody, and they're all buying it. But Japan, in particular, we're very happy that they're going to start immediately, and we can supply it to the world, but we're supplying it to Japan, and they're going to always be right up in the front of the line.\nYes, go ahead. Please. Go ahead.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nYes, I have.\nPentagon, Education, just about everything. We're going to go through everything, just as it was so bad with what we just went through with this horrible situation we just went through, and I guess 97 percent of the people have been dismissed. It was very, very unfortunate.\nYou're not going to find anything like that, but you're going to find a lot. And I've instructed him to go check out Education, to check out the Pentagon, which is the military. And you know, sadly, you'll find some things that are pretty bad. But I don't think, proportionally, you're going to see anything like we just saw.\nNo, but I'll fire some of them because some of them were corrupt. I have no doubt about that. I got to know a lot about that business, that world.\nI got to know a lot about that world, and we had some corrupt agents, and those people are gone, or they will be gone, and it will be done quickly and very surgically.\nDid you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nTalk up.\nI don't know. I don't know. I know we have some that are very corrupt, and we don't like it. We're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI. Kash Patel is going to do a great job, and we're going to bring back the reputation of the FBI, which has been hurt very badly. It's been devastated over the last 4 years.\nIt's actually a good question, and we will have relations with North Korea and with Kim Jong Un. I got along with him very well, as you know. I think I stopped a war. I think if I wouldn't have won that particular election, you would have ended up in that——\n——a very bad—a very bad situation, but I did. And we had a good relationship, and I think it's a very big asset for everybody that I do get along with him. I like—I mean, I get along with him. He gets along with me. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing.\nAnd I can tell you that Japan likes the idea, because their relationship is not very good with him. And if I can have a relationship with not only him but other people throughout the world where there seem to be difficulties, I think that's a tremendous asset for the world, not just the United States.\nGo ahead, Garrett [Garrett Haake, NBC News].\nWhite House Senior Adviser Elon R. Musk\nWell, we haven't discussed that much. I'll tell him to go here, go there. He does it. He's got a very capable group of people, very, very, very capable. They know what they're doing. They'll ask questions, and they'll see immediately, as somebody gets tongue tied, that they're either crooked or don't know what they're doing.\nWe have very smart people going in. So I've instructed him, \"Go into Education, go into military, go into other things as we go along.\" And they're finding massive amounts of fraud, abuse, waste, all of these things.\nSo—but I will pick out a target, and I say, \"Go in.\" There could be areas that we won't, but I can—I think everything's fertile. You know, we're a Government. We have to be open, and as an open Government—I don't know, I guess you could say maybe some high intelligence or something. And I'll do that myself, if I have to.\nBut generally speaking, I'll just say, \"Go.\" But he will be looking at Education pretty quickly, and he will be looking at military too.\nSure.\nWell, they don't really have to be looked at by him. They can be looked at by us. Social Security will not be touched. It will only be strengthened.\nWe have illegal immigrants on Social Security, and we're going to find out who they are and take them out. We have illegal immigrants in other—Medicare. We have—we found a lot of bad people, a lot of people that shouldn't be on that were put on when—through California. They come—a lot of them come out of California. We're not going to stand for that.\nSo we're going to strengthen our Social Security, et cetera. We're not going to touch it, other than to make it stronger. But we have people that shouldn't be on, and those people we have to weed out. Most of them or many of them, so far, have been illegal immigrants. They shouldn't even be in the country.\nDo you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nThat's a very good answer. [Laughter] Very good answer. Wow. That's very good. He knows what he's doing.\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you, everybody.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-shigeru-ishiba-japan"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India", "Date": "2025-02-13", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please. Great honor.\nI'm thrilled to welcome the Prime Minister of India, my friend, Narendra Modi back to the White House. We spent a lot of time here and a lot of time in India, and he's a very special man.\nPrime Minister, it is a pleasure to extend to you the same hospitality that you showed Melania and myself when we traveled to your beautiful country 5 years ago. It's hard to believe so long ago, and it seemed like yesterday. It was beautiful. We opened the cricket stadium—129,000 seats, I think the largest stadium in the world, and it was an incredible period of time.\nThere is truly a special bond between the United States and India and the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy and, I believe, the world's largest country, in terms of the numbers of people. And today the Prime Minister and I are announcing a framework to strengthen those ties even further economically, and the U.S.-India compact for the 21st century is a historic initiative that will deepen every aspect of our partnership and our friendship.\nStarting this year, we'll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters.\nIn 2017, my administration revived and reinvigorated the Quad security partnership. In our meeting today, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan, and it's crucial really to maintaining peace and prosperity, tranquility even, in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn addition, the United States and India will be working together like never before to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, a threat all over the world actually.\nToday I'm pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and one of the very evil people of the world and having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India. So he's going to be going back to India to face justice.\nAs we deepen our defense partnership, we'll also strengthen our economic ties and bring greater fairness and reciprocity to our trading relationship.\nAs a signal of good faith, Prime Minister Modi recently announced the reductions to India's unfair, very strong tariffs that limit U.S. access into the Indian market very strongly. And really, it's big problem, I must say. India imposes a 30- to 40- to 60- and even 70-percent tariff on so many of the goods and, in some cases, far more than that.\nAs an example, a 70-percent tariff on U.S. cars going into India, which makes it pretty much impossible to sell those cars.\nToday, the U.S. trade deficit with India is almost $100 billion, and Prime Minister Modi and I have agreed that we'll begin negotiations to address the long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last 4 years—but they didn't do that—in the U.S.-India trading relationship, with the goal of a—signing an agreement. And we want—really, we want a certain level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to, and he does also, in fairness, so we're going to work on that very hard. And we can make up the difference very easily with the deficit with the sale of oil and gas and LNG, of which we have more than anybody in the world.\nThe Prime Minister and I also reached an important agreement on energy that will restore the United States as a leading supplier of oil and gas to India. It will be, hopefully, their number-one supplier in the groundbreaking development for U.S. nuclear industry. India is also reforming its laws to welcome U.S. nuclear technology, which is at the highest level, into the Indian market. This will bring safe, clean, and affordable electricity to millions of Indians and tens of billions of dollars to the U.S.-civilian nuclear industry in India.\nAnd under the framework we are announcing today, the United States and India are also joining forces to ensure that artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies are developed by the two of the most—really, two of the most advanced nations, intellectually and otherwise technologically, anywhere in the world. There's nobody very much closer. We have an incredible relationship there. And those are—this is where it seems to be heading.\nAnd artificial intelligence—complex—a very complex subject, but it seems to be where people want to be and they want to go, and we're leading right now by a lot, but other people will try to catch us. I don't know if they're going to be able to. We're going to make it available. We're going to make tremendous amounts of electricity available, and we're going to let the people that are buying the electricity make their own electric plants—electric generation plants, and we've never done this in our country, but we're going to get it done very quickly.\nLee Zeldin and his group are going to get the approvals in very rapid form. And we're calling it a \"national emergency,\" and that's exactly what it is. So we're going to be—we're going to remain at the top of the AI or artificial intelligence, I think, for a long time to come, and we're going to be working very closely with India and other countries on that. But right now we're the leader by quite a bit.\nFinally, we agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history. It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States, connecting our partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables—many, many undersea cables. It's a big development. It's a lot of money going to be spent, and we've already spent some, but we're going to be spending a lot more in order to stay advanced and stay the leader.\nI'm pleased to report that with today's announcements, the friendship between the United States and India is the strongest I believe it's ever been. I think our relationship is the best it's ever been between two leaders of the two countries, and it's an honor to say that.\nI'd like to now invite the Prime Minister to say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And we appreciate you all being here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.\nThank you. Thank you very much. Great job.\nBeautiful.\nOkay, thank you very much. That was excellent.\nWe'll do a few questions, please.\nPlease, go ahead. Please, go ahead. Yes. Yes, blue shirt.\nYou're going to have to go louder.\n——a word he's saying. It's not the—it's the accent. It's a little bit tough for me.\nHow about—how about you. Please. Go ahead, back there.\nThat's your question, but I'll answer it. I agree with you. [Laughter] Yes, gross incompetence.\nWe're going to have a fantastic relationship. And it has been like the whole world has been set back over the last 4 years by the weakness of the United States, the weak leadership of the United States, but I think we've taken care of it in just 3 weeks. It seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn't prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it—not only our country, but the whole world.\nThe Prime Minister told me that before too. Even over India, the world has a light. They need the United States to be strong and powerful but good, and I think that's happened. And I think it's happened in a very short period of time.\nBut I will tell you, we're going to have a fantastic relationship, and it will make both countries much stronger.\n[At this point, several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nAll right?\nYes, go ahead, please.\nOkay. Fine.\nIndia-U.S. Relations\nWell, I don't think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration. Biden—they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe, because, you know, it's a good thing to do. And a lot of things happened that weren't very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration—the Biden administration.\nBut as you said, we're giving a very violent man—it seems to me—I mean, I don't know that he's been convicted yet or will be, but let's assume he's a pretty violent person—we're giving him back to India immediately. And there are more to follow, because we have quite a few requests.\nSo we work with India on crime, and we want to make it good for India, and it's very important. So that kind of a relationship is very important to us.\nOkay?\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please.\nGo ahead.\nIndia-U.S. Trade Relations/European Union/China/Tariffs\nSure.\nWell, India has been, to us, just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world. They've been very strong on tariffs, and I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.\nWe are right now a reciprocal nation. We are going to—if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them. Whatever another country charges, we're charging them. So it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. We didn't have that.\nWe—I was going to do that in my other term, and we had the greatest economy ever in the world. We've never—there's never been an economy like we had, and then we got hit with COVID. We had a focus on that, and I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare.\nBut we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know, and we didn't do the tariffs. We would have done the reciprocal tariffs, but we decided—and I decided, I think, on a human basis—on a humane basis not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems.\nBut now we do—we're doing—we see a tremendous future for our country. But we felt that now it's finally time, after 45 or 50 years of abuse, that we will do—and this isn't India, this is among a lot of nations.\nThe European Union is very difficult for us—very, very difficult. They tax our companies at levels that nobody's ever seen before. They take advantage of a lot of things. So we're not happy about that.\nChina, of course, is terrible, and we've never taken in 10 cents until I was President. We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been President—in first term and now—and we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness, and that's what I've done.\nAnd so, we are being reciprocal with India. Whatever India charges, we charge them. So, frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge—I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high, and I was unable to get a concession. So we're just going to do it the easy way, and we're just going to say, \"Whatever you charge, we charge.\" And I think that's fair for the people of the United States, and I think it's actually fair for India.\nOkay?\nGo ahead, please. Ask to the Prime Minister, please.\nAsk to the Prime Minister, please.\nYes.\nWell, I—maybe I'll just go and—first on this one. We had some talks, and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people—largely, they overlap—\"You have to pay more money because it's unfair what we're doing. We're doing a tremendous amount more.\" We're probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight, and Europe has not really carried its weight in terms of the money. It's not equitable, and we want to see a counterbalance. We want to have them put up more money. They have to do that.\nAt the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day—yesterday. And we also had a very good conversation—I did, both—in both cases—with President Zelenskyy. And I think we're going to be able to do something. I think we're going to be able to make a deal, and I hope so, because it's a horrible war. It's a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least, already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like—nobody has ever seen anything like it since—certainly since the Second World War.\nAnd so I think we're going to be able to do something. We're working with President Zelenskyy and with President Putin, and my impression is that they—I know that President Zelenskyy wants to make a deal, and I also feel that—I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions.\nBut the meeting and the conversation—also, the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one, and my phone call with him was a very successful one.\nThank you. That was very nice.\nGo ahead, please.\nGo ahead. Please. Yes. Please.\nSir, go ahead, please.\nRussia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. If I were President, it would not have happened—absolutely would not have happened, and it didn't happen for 4 years.\nIf you look at what has taken place, under President Bush, they lost a lot. Under President Obama, they lost Crimea. Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing. Under Trump, they lost nothing—Ukraine lost nothing. They didn't give up anything. And you take a look at the other three Presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot.\nI think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they're in, it's got to be ended, and it's got to be stopped.\nNow, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory, and they also have said from day one—long before President Putin, they've said they cannot have Ukraine be in NATO. They said that very strongly.\nI actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. And Biden said it, and Zelenskyy said it, and I think that was one of the reasons—one of the starts of the war.\nBut from long before Putin, they said you cannot have—you cannot have Ukraine going in, in any way, into NATO. And I start from that standpoint. I think everybody knew that.\nNow, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they were able to make a deal where they can do that, that's fine with me. I really don't care. I want that bloodshed to stop. I don't want to see—you know, we have an ocean between us and the site we're talking about—the site of death. We're calling it the fields of death. We have a big ocean in between us. This is more important for Europe. We shouldn't be in—they have to equalize, and they're going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize.\nBut as far as the negotiation, it's too early to say what's going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won't, and it's all dependent on what is going to happen. The negotiation really hasn't started.\nBut I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that, and I think Ukraine knew that, because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until more recently. So that's the way it is, and I think that's the way it's going to have to be.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nGo ahead, please. All right. Go ahead, please, with the tie.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nWith the tie, yes.\nYes, go ahead, please.\nIndia-U.S. Trade Relations\nOh, he's a much tougher negotiator than me, and he's a much better negotiator than me. There's not even a contest. Okay? [Laughter]\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nYes, go ahead. Please go ahead. Go ahead.\nWell, I think we are going to have a very good relationship with China. I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. That was a bridge too far. But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. We were very close, as leaders go. I don't want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close.\nAnd I think that China is a very important player in the world. I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia.\nAnd I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped. That's been going on for a long time, and it's quite violent. It's quite violent.\nBut I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along. It's very important.\nYou know, the power of weaponry today is—and not only nuclear, but nuclear, in particular—the power of weaponry is very important. I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries. And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal, and we had the confines of a deal. We—we were—I thought we—he really wanted to do it and so did I—denuclearize. And it's so—it's such a beautiful term, when you think about it. In other words, to bring it down, because the power of those weapons is—is too great.\nAnd I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response. He's building a very strong nuclear power. He's not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon. I mean, he'll catch up over the period of 4 or 5 years, they say.\nBut it would be a great thing if we could—on a military basis, we're going to spend this year 900—let's say $915 billion on military. Russia, without the war, was spending close to a hundred, but with the war, I can't tell you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot. And China is spending $400- and $450 billion. We're over $900 billion. And I said, \"You know, it doesn't really make sense.\" I said, \"We're spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose if we got along.\" And I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen.\nFirst, when I left, as you know, 4 years ago, we didn't have Israel and the Middle East. We didn't have October 7—what a disaster—the disaster. Nothing was happening. Iran was not in—going to do anything, because Iran did not have much money at that point. They were broke. They were totally broke. They didn't have money for Hamas or for Hizballah. And you didn't have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened.\nBut now I come back, and I have—the whole world is on fire, so I have to put out the fires. But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China, and I'm going to meet with Russia, and we're going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down—military—especially as it pertains to nuclear.\nEverybody, thank you very much. Thank you very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nAnd I very much appreciate the Prime Minister visiting our great country, and I do really appreciate it. We have so much in common, and all we want to do is have peace, and we want to have strength, and we want to have lots of different things together, but the relationship with India and with the Prime Minister has never been better.\nThank you very much.\nThank you very much.\nA great honor. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-narendra-modi-india-0"}
{"Title": "Interview With Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel's \"Sean Hannity Show\"", "Date": "2025-02-14", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you.\nThank you.\nThat's right. That's right.\nWell, I sued—I sued from long before he had it.\nAnd, I mean, they really did a number on me, you know. And I sued, and they had to pay. You know, they paid $10 million settlement.\n——it's a very low—I was looking to get much more money than that.\nHe got—oh, he got a big discount. I don't think he even knows about it.\nThat's the way he said that. You know, there's something nice about. [Laughter]\nIt is.\nDid I have a choice? [Laughter]\nI didn't have a choice.\nThat's the only thing I can say.\nThat speeded it up a little bit?\nNice. I didn't know that.\nSure.\nIt's true.\nOh, I see it all the time. They tried it, then they stopped. That wasn't—they have many different things of hatred. Actually, Elon called me. He said, \"You know they're trying to drive us apart.\" I said, \"Absolutely.\"\nYou know, they said: \"We have breaking news: Donald Trump has ceded control of the Presidency to Elon Musk. President Musk will be attending a Cabinet meeting tonight at 8 o'clock.\" [Laughter] And I say—it's just so obvious. They're so bad at it.\nI used to think they were good at it. They're actually bad at it, because if they were good at it, I'd never be President because I think nobody in history has ever gotten more bad publicity than me.\nI could do the greatest things; I get 98-percent bad publicity. I could do—outside of you and a few of your very good friends. It's, like, the craziest thing.\nBut you know what I have learned, Elon? The people are smart. They get it.\nThey get it. They really see what's happening.\nWell, I respect him. I've always respected him. I never knew that he was right on certain things, and I'm usually pretty good at this stuff. He did Starlink. He did things that were so advanced, and nobody knew what the hell they were.\nI can tell you, in North Carolina, they had no communication. They were wiped out. Those people were—you know, they had rivers in between—land that never saw water, all of a sudden, there was a river and a vicious—like, rapids. People were dying all over. They had no communication.\nThey said, \"Do you know Elon Musk?\" And they didn't really know I knew him. I said, \"Yeah.\" They said, \"Could you get Starlink?\" It's, like, the first time I ever heard of it. I said, \"What's Starlink?\" \"A communication system that's unbelievable.\"\nAnd he—yes. And he said—I called him, and I said, \"Listen, they really need it.\" And he got, like, thousands of units of this communication, and it saved a lot of lives. He got it immediately. And you can't get it. I mean, you have to wait a long time to get it. But he got it to him immediately.\nAnd I said, \"That's pretty amazing.\" And I didn't even know he had it.\nWe watch the rocket ships, and we watch Tesla. I think, you know, something that had an effect on me was when I saw the rocket ship come back and get grabbed like you grab a beautiful little baby. You grab your baby. It just——\nYes. No, but—and he said: \"You know, you can't really have a rocket program if you're going to dump a billion dollars into the ocean every time you fly. You have to save it.\" And he saved it. First time——\n——I've ever seen that done. Now nobody else can do it.\nIf you look at the U.S., Russia, or China, they can't do it, and they won't be able to do it for a long time. He has the technology. So you learn—I wanted somebody really smart to work with me, in terms of the country—a very important aspect. Because, I mean, he doesn't talk about it. He's actually a very good businessman. And when he talks about the Executive orders—and this is probably true for all Presidents: You write an Executive order and you think it's done, you send it out; it doesn't get done. It doesn't get implemented. They don't implement it.\nThey—maybe they're from the last administration—and they are, in some cases. You try and get them out as fast as you can. But I could—as soon as he said that, I said, \"You know, that's interesting.\" You write a beautiful Executive—and you sign it and you assume it's going to be done, but it's not. What he does is he takes it, and with his hundred geniuses—he's got some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually——\n——they dress in just t-shirts. [Laughter] You wouldn't know they have 180 IQ.\nNo, no. He is——\nHe's much more than that.\nBut he gets it done. He's a leader. He really is a—he gets it done. You get a lot of tech people, and you have people, they're good with tech, but they—he gets it done.\nYou know, I said, in real estate, you had guys that would draw beautiful renderings of a building, and they'd draw the rendering, it would be great, and you'd say: \"Great. When are you starting?\" But they were never able to get it built. They couldn't get the financing. They couldn't get the approvals. It would never get done. And then you have other guys that are able to get it done. You know, they could just get it done.\nI was in real estate. Same thing in this. He gets it done.\nSo, when he said that—he said, \"You know, when you sign these Executive orders, a lot of them don't get done, and maybe the most important ones,\" and he would take that Executive order that I'd signed, and he would have those people go to whatever agency it was—\"When are you doing it? Get it done. Get it done.\" And some guy that maybe didn't want to do it, all of a sudden, he's signing—he just doesn't want to bother.\nYes, and they will. A lot of them will be. Yes.\nLook, in the meantime, we have 4 years. The beauty is, we have 4 years. That's why I like doing it right at the beginning. Because an Executive order is great. I mean, the one problem—it's both good and bad, because when they did all these Executive orders, I've canceled most of them. They were terrible. I mean, we were going to go radical left, Communist, okay? It was crazy. Their——\n——Executive orders were so bad, if they ever got them codified, you'd never be able to break them. So the damage that Biden has done to this country—and it's not even Biden; it's the people that circled him in the Oval Office, okay?—but the damage they did to this country, in terms of, let's say, open borders—you know, there's so many things, but open borders, where millions of people poured into our country, and hundreds of thousands of those people are criminals. They're murderers. They're drug dealers. They're gang members. They're people from prisons from all over the world.\nAnd we have a great guy, Tom Homan, and he is doing so incredibly. You saw the numbers. They're down like 96 percent.\nHe is a phenomenal guy. And Kristi Noem is doing an unbelievable job. And he wanted her. He said, \"She's so tough.\" And I said: \"I don't think of her as that way. You know, she's very nice.\" He said, \"No, she's so tough.\" And she is. I see her with the horses. She's riding the horse. Let's—[laughter]—she's great.\nBut the team we have is really unbelievable.\nBut those Executive orders, I sign them, and now they get passed on to him and his group and other people, and they're all getting done. We're getting them done.\nHe's going to go into orbit soon.\nNo, he's going to go to Mars. He's going to fly on his——\nAnd you like Bobby, right?\nYes.\nThat's why I became President.\nHe's good. You know, I wanted to find somebody smarter than him. I searched all over. I just couldn't do it. I couldn't. I couldn't.\nI couldn't find anyone smarter, right? So we had to—we had to, for the country.\nSo we settled on—we settled on this guy.\n[Laughter] Yes.\nAnd they're very committed people.\nWhen are you—when are you getting them?\nThey got left in space.\nBiden.\nWhen are they—when are you going to launch?\nAnd you have the go-ahead.\nYou now have the go-ahead.\nThey didn't have the go-ahead with Biden.\nHe was going to leave him in space. I think he was going to leave them in space.\nYes, he didn't want the publicity. Can you believe it?\nHe saved a lot of lives. In North Carolina, he saved a lot of lives.\nCalifornia. But, I mean, in North Carolina, where they were really in trouble, they had no communication, people were dying.\nThey were dying of starvation. He saved a lot of lives in North Carolina.\nYes. And my goal was to get great people. And when you look at what this man has done, I mean, it was something—I knew him a little bit through the White House. Originally, I'd see him around a little bit. I didn't know him before that, and I respected what he did. And he fought hard. You know, he was a—he was maybe questioned for a while. He was having some difficulties. It was not easy doing what he did.\nI mean, how many people have started a car company and made it really successful and made a better car where it's, you know, beating these big companies that that's all they do is cars? I mean, it's really amazing the things that he's done.\nBut I didn't know it as much then as now. I mean, the fruits have sort of taken hold.\nBut I wanted great people, and he's a great person. He's an amazing person. He's also a caring person. You know, he uses the word \"care.\"\nSo they sign a contract in a Government agency, and it has 3 months. And the guy leaves that signed the contract, and nobody else is there, and they pay the contract for 10 years.\nSo the guy is getting checks for years and years and years, and he's telling his family, obviously—maybe he was crooked, maybe he paid to get the contract, or maybe he paid that they didn't terminate him. But, you know, we have contracts that go forever, and they've been going for years, and they're supposed to end in 3 months or 5 months or 2 years or something, and they go forever. So the guy is either crooked—you know, where he knew this was going to happen—or he's crooked because he's getting payments that he knows he shouldn't be getting.\nBut they're finding things like that. They're finding things far worse than that. And they're finding billions—and it will be hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of fraud. I say waste and abuse, but fraud, waste, and abuse. And he's doing an amazing job.\nAnd he attracts a young, very smart type of person. I call them high-IQ individuals, and they are. They're very high Q and—high IQ. And when they go in to see the people and talk to these people—you know, the people think they're going to pull it over. They don't. These guys are smart, and they love the country. You know, there's a certain something.\nBut he uses the word \"care.\" So people have to care. Like, when I bought Air Force One——\n——I negotiated the price. It was $5.7 billion, and I got it—I got them down $1.7 billion. Now they're not building the plane fast enough. I mean, they're actually in default—Boeing. They're supposed to——\nThey've been building this thing forever. I don't know——\n——what's going on.\nWe don't build the way we used to build. You know, we used to build like a ship a day, and now to build a ship is, like, a big deal, and we're going to get this country back on track. We could do it, but so many things—it takes so long to get things built and get things done.\nAnd a lot of it could be something we've been discussing. The regulators go in and they make it impossible to build. They make it very difficult to build anything, whether it's a ship, a plane, or a building or anything. And some of them do it because they want to show how important they are. Some of them do it maybe because they think they're right. They use the environment to stop progress and to stop things. It's always the environment. \"It's an environmental problem.\" It's not an environmental problem at all. But they do a lot of things.\nAnd by the way, speaking of that, Lee Zeldin is going to be fantastic in the position. So important. He could take 10 years to approve or disapprove something, or he could do it in a month. You know, just as good.\nAnd I think you're going to see some fantastic—a fantastic job done by him. He's a tremendous guy.\nThat's always the first thing they do.\n\"He's in violation of the Constitution.\" They don't even know what they're talking—well, they know.\nIt's just a con job. It's a big con job. And they're so bad for the country, so dangerous and so bad.\nAnd the media is so bad. When I watch MSNBC, which I don't watch much, but you have to watch the enemy on occasion, the level of arrogance and cheating and—they're just horrible people. These are horrible people.\nThese are horrible people.\nThey lie, and they start up with the Constitution. They couldn't care less about the Constitution.\nCNN, likewise. I mean, I watched them asking questions with, you know, the hatred with the—why—I said: \"What are you asking the question with such anger? You're asking me a normal question.\" But you see the bias. The bias is so incredible. Those two are bad.\nPBS is bad. AP is bad. CBS is terrible.\nI mean, CBS now—they changed an answer in Kamala. They asked her some questions. She answered them like, you know, a low-IQ person. The opposite of him—the absolute opposite. But she gave a horrible answer. They took the entire answer out, and they put another answer that she gave 20 minutes later into the—in—as the answer.\nI've never even heard of that before—I thought I heard of it all.\nNo, no. They took the entire—this long, terrible statement that she made and put another.\nNobody's ever seen what's happening. And you know, the people that do all this complaining, they're very dishonest people.\nYes.\nThat's right.\nBut we could take—we were talking about this yesterday. I could take—give me thousands of bills—any—I could pick any one of them, and I could——\n——take all thousand. And let's say it's a bill for $5,000—just $5,000, and it's done by some bureaucrat. And if he would say, \"I'll give you three. I don't want to pay you five. It's too high. I'll give you three.\" But they don't do that. If a guy sends in a bill for $5,000, they pay $5,000. They expect to be cut. Everybody expects to be cut. When you send in a bill, you expect to be cut. They send in the bill higher, for the most part. This is true with lawyers, legal fees. When they send in legal fees, you—I can cut—I wish I had the time, I would save so—but I could cut these bills in half—much better than half.\nBut you offer people a much lower number because you know they—they actually put fat—I'm not even saying it's—it's like a way of business. They put more on because they expect to be negotiated. When you send in a bill to the Government, there's nobody to negotiate.\nYou send it a bill for $10,000, and they send you a check back for $10,000. If you would call them and said, \"We'll give you five.\" \"No, no, no. I need more than five.\" \"We'll give you a five.\" \"I'm not going to pay any more than five.\" \"Make it six.\" \"No, I'm not going to make it six.\" And you'll settle for $5,500. You've just cut the bill almost in half, and it took, like, 2 minutes. When did that stop? But——\n——that's caring. No, it's not even the art of the deal. It's caring. He uses the word—\n——it's caring.\nIt's a certain competence, but I think it's more caring.\nAnd a lot of fraud, Sean. A lot of fraud.\nAnd a lot of kickbacks.\nThey're sending money out. They're not that stupid. These people aren't that stupid. They're sending for transgender—something having to do with the opera, and they're sending out $7 million—\n——$7 million. [Inaudible]\nNo, it's incredible.\nNo, but it's incredible: $7 million.\nNow, you know they—they're not so stupid. They're sending all this money. They expect to get a lot of it back. And that's what happens.\nThe one thing you didn't mention, the media. The media is getting millions of dollars.\n——you know, garbage magazine or program. I guess they have magazine, and they have some—some media of all types. $8 million.\nI hear the New York Times got a lot. I hear they get subscriptions—where they have subscriptions but maybe the paper is not sent. I have no idea if that's true or not, but it's—they call it subscriptions. Lots of subscription—to different media, not just the Times—maybe the Times, and maybe not the Times.\nWell—but millions of dollars going to media that's radical-left, crooked, dishonest media.\nThe FBI has to be rehabbed. The FBI——\nWhat's happened with the FBI and the DOJ is just—their stock has gone way down. I mean, their reputation is shot.\nAnd I think Pam is going to do great. I think Kash is going to do great. I think they have to do great or we have a problem.\nBut when you look at what they did, the raid of Mar-a-Lago—the raid of Mar-a-Lago—you look at what they did, their reputation is shot.\nTwo trillion—yes. We inherited it.\nYes. And inflation is back. I'm only here for 2½ weeks.\nNo, think of it, inflation is back. And they said, \"Oh, Trump inflation\"—I had nothing to do with it. These people have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent. They were given $9 trillion to throw out the window—$9 trillion, and they spent it on the green new scam, I call it. It's the greatest scam in the history of the country. One of them. We have a lot of them, I guess. But one of them.\n——it is.\nYes, yes.\nWell, that's all part of it. Yes.\nYou know, the amazing thing is, when you see, like, the teaching of DEI: $9 million. How do you spend $9 million to teach no matter what it is?\nYou could teach physics.\nYou could go to MIT for a lot less.\n——of DEI.\nNo, it's a kickback. It's got to be a kickback. Nobody is that—nobody could do that. Nobody is——\nNobody is giving—to assess the dialog of an audience coming out of a theater: $4 million.\nOne percent. [Laughter] No, because it's so massive. It's—this is——\n——huge money. Huge money. Look——\nAs good as they are, they're not going to find some contract that was crooked—you know, crooked as hell. And, I mean, there's going to be so much that isn't found. But what is found—I think he's going to find a trillion dollars.\nBut I think it's a very small percentage compared to what it is. I mean, he could tell you about treasuries; he could tell you about a woman that worked for Biden that became a very wealthy woman while she was working for him. Right?\nWhile they were working.\nSean, the saddest thing is they don't talk about the individual lines. I could go on your show right now, I could get a list that I have on the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, and it's got 40 points, and all they are is the heading of what this money is.\nYou don't have to go deep into it, and you see it's, you know, all different things and it's so ridiculous. I mean, normally, when you look for fraud, you're looking for one thing out of a hundred. Here, out of a hundred, 95 are going to be bad. I mean, they're—and they're so obvious just by the heading.\nBut they never mention that. They only mention: \"This is a violation of our Constitution. This is a\"—the word they give, you know, it's like a sound bite—\"constitutional crisis.\" It's a new thing, \"constitution\"—but they never mention about where the money is going.\nAnd when people hear that—I had a very smart man, John Kennedy—he's actually a very smart man. He said, \"Sir, you should just go on television and just read the name of the topic that you're giving all the money—just the topic that you're giving this money to, and don't say anything more,\" and he's right.\nBut they never talk about where the money is going. They just talk about, \"It's a constitutional crisis.\"\nIt's so sad. And honestly, I think they're bad people. I used to give them the benefit of the doubt, but you almost think they hate the country. I think they hate the country. They're sick people.\nThat's right. You know the good news, though? They've lost their confidence. They're not the same people.\nThey're not the same people. This election was brutal for them. We won every swing State. We won by millions and millions of votes. We won everything. We—all 50 States went up—all 50. It's never happened.\nEvery one. All 50 States went up.\nThey've lost their confidence. I see it. And they're just swirling and twirling. They don't know what the hell is happening. They're much different. They're just as mean, but they're not getting to the point.\nWell, the media—you're talking about the media.\nThe media—no, they're—you know, the anger that—they ask questions so angry—a question—a normal question. I give them an answer. They—but they—I say, \"Why are you so angry when you ask a question?\" Just a standard question. And, I don't know, there's something——\nYes.\nYes. Yes.\nI just—[inaudible]—so much and—and then Elon goes. But look, Social Security won't be touched——\n——other than if there's fraud or something—we're going to find it; it's going to be strengthened—but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched. It's just——\n[Inaudible]—don't have to.\nNow, if there are illegal migrants in the system, we're going to get them out of the system, and all of that fraud. But it's not going to be touched.\nSchool—I want to bring school back to the States, so that Iowa, Indiana—all these places—Idaho, New Hampshire—there's so many places, the States. I figure 35 really run well.\nAnd right now, it's Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, China—China, can you imagine?—has top schools. We're last.\nSo they have a list of 40 countries. We're number 40. Usually we're 38, 39, but last time, we were number 40. And what I say is you've got to give it back. So it doesn't work.\nI'll tell you what we're number one in: cost per pupil. We spend more money than any other country by far—it's not even close—per pupil. Okay? So, we know it doesn't work.\nSo we spend the most and we have the worst—right?—the worst result. When we give that—when we give that back to Indiana, when we give that back to Iowa and back to a lot of the States that run well—they run well, a lot of them—35, 37, 38—now, you're going to have 10 laggards, but you're going to have 5 real laggards, but that's going to be okay.\nTake New York—you give it to Westchester County, you give it to Suffolk County, you give it to Upstate New York, and you give it to Manhattan—but you give it to four or five subsections. Same thing in California. Los Angeles is going to be a problem, but you're going to give it to places that run well. We can change education\nNow, school choice is important, but that will get care—taken care of automatically.\nWe want to bring education back to the States. You will spend half the number.\nI'm not even—I'm not even doing this to save, but you will save. It will cost you much less money. You get a much better education.\nIf you go to some of these States, you'll be the equivalent of Norway, Sweden, Denmark—places that really have a good school system. You'll have—those places will be the equivalent, and your overall numbers will get so much better.\n——and arithmetic. Okay?\nOkay. A little science. You know——\n——you're not going to have much of a problem with that, but that's it.\n——the level. For what? To—I mean, for—what do they do?\nWe have really bad education—the teachers—I love teachers. I respect teachers. And, by the way, there's no reason why teachers can't form a union. They can do whatever they want to do, if it's back in the States. So we're not looking to hurt the teacher—I'm going to help the teachers. I think the teachers should be incentivized, because a good teacher is like a good scientist, is like a great doctor.\nIt's a valuable commodity.\nI think they should be incentivized.\nSo I'm totally for the teachers.\nRight.\nRight.\nBy the way, forms of that could be done.\nForms of that could be done.\nWe got hurt when we didn't get the vote on Obamacare. I made Obamacare—I had a choice: I could let it rot and win a point, or I could do the best you could do with it. And that's what I did. We did a great job with it, and we made it sort of work, but it's lousy. We could do so much better.\nAnd when you say—you go to certain areas, they have doctors round the clock. They have great medical care for a fraction of what we're paying right now.\nThere are things we could do. But look, just overall, this man has been so valuable. I hate to see the way they go after him. They go after him. It's so unfair. He doesn't need this. He wants to do this.\nFirst of all, this is bigger than anything he's ever done. He's done great companies and all, but this is much—you know, this is trillion—everything's trillions, right?\nHe'll never do anything bigger.\nYou have some States that operate that way. They operate as well as any corporation. They really operate well.\nThey have surpluses. They have—they don't——\nWhen they—when they look at New York and—and California and some of these places that should have an advantage—I mean, there's a big advantage—or Pritzker does such a bad job in Illinois; it's horrible how bad he is—and they don't have that advantage.\nYou know, New York has stock exchange and a lot of things. And California has the weather and the beautiful water and all the thing-—\nYes. [Laughter] But—but——\nBut some States operate the way he's talking about.\nWhen you go into some of these States, you're going to find very little. You're going to find almost nothing. They really operate well—big surpluses, low taxes. And——\nI—well, I did.\nIt was the right decision—in fact, Reagan tried to do it—because it rewards badly run States.\nBut at the same time, it's a tough—it was—it's tough for the States. I mean, it really is tough for the States. The sad part is, it rewards really badly run States.\nAnd Reagan tried to do it. He was unable to do it. I got it done.\nAnd now we're going to give some back.\nBecause you know what? We've got to help them.\nWe've got to help.\nNobody had any idea it would be that devastating. I did the right thing. I got something that Reagan couldn't do. I got it done, where everybody is—are the same. But you know what? We've got to help them out.\nRight.\nIt was Biden.\nAnd you know Biden wouldn't give him much.\nIt's—it's going to be, by the way. I really believe it's going to be.\nBecause the country is going to do well beside this. This is cutting. We're only talking about cutting.\nWe're also going to make a lot of money. We're going—we're taking in so much money.\nThen we won't let him do it.\nWe're not going to let him do it. He—if——\nHe's in certain areas—I mean, I see this morning—I didn't—I didn't know, but I said, \"Do the right thing\"—where they're cutting way back on the electric vehicle subsidies.\nThey're cutting back.\nYes.\nHe's probably not that happy with it, but that would have been one thing he would have come to me and said: \"Listen, you've got to do me a favor. This is crazy.\" [Laughter] But this was in the tax bill. They're cutting back on the subsidies.\nI didn't—I wasn't involved in it. I said, \"Do what's right, and you get\"—and they're coming up with the tax, but it's just preliminary.\nBut I mean, if he were involved, wouldn't you think he'd probably do that? Now, maybe he does better if you cut back on the subsidies. Who knows. Because he figures—he does think differently. He thinks he has a better product, and as long as he has a level playing field, he doesn't care what you do——\n——which he's very—he's told me that.\nIt's true.\nHe won't be involved.\nIf there's a conflict, he won't be involved.\nI mean, I wouldn't want that, and he won't want it.\nHe's—I know every businessman. I know the—the good ones, the bad ones, the smart ones, the lucky ones. I know them all. This guy is a very—he's a brilliant guy. He's a great guy. He's got tremendous imagination and scientific imagination—far beyond—you know, you keep talking about a technologist and all, but you're much more than a technologist. You are that. But he's also a good person. He's a very good person, and he wants to see the country do well.\nAnd I know a lot of great businesspeople, really great businesspeople, but, you know, they're not really, in some cases, very good people. And I know people that would try and take advantage of the situation.\nThis guy is somebody that really cares for the country, and I saw that very early on. I saw it, really, a long time ago when I got to know him. He's a very different kind of a character.\nThat's why—you know who loves him: young people that are very smart and that love the country. He's got, like, a tremendous following, because that's what he's—he's a good person.\nAnd he doesn't need this. He didn't need this, and he's doing this to help the country. If I didn't win this election, this country was—I don't think it could have made it. I don't—I mean, we're allowing criminals—millions of criminals into our country, where everything is transgender, it's men playing in women's sports.\nI mean, none of this stuff—you could go—I could give you a hundred things. It's almost like they're trying to destroy the fabric of the country, of the world, because the world was following us. Now the world is following us out of this pit.\nWe've done a lot. I'll tell you what, in 3 weeks, we've done more—I think we've done more—in terms of meaningful, not just dollars—than maybe any President ever. And a lot of people are saying that.\nI mean, if we can keep it going at this level, this country is going to be at a level that it's never seen before.\nTariffs/U.S. Trade Policy\nYes, reciprocal.\nEverybody. Everybody. Everybody but us.\nAnd I was doing it—you know, I charged China tariffs. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and I was doing that. But when we got—we had the greatest economy in history. But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it—and now I said, I want to come back and do the reciprocal—because every country in the world almost—we have a deficit with almost every country—not every one, but just about, pretty close.\nAnd—but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes—make it—it's impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don't know if that's true or not, but I think——\n——they don't want to—now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us. It's very unfair.\nAnd I said, \"You know what we do?\" I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday—he was here. I said: \"Here's what you do. We're going to do—be very fair with you.\" They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.\nOh, much—much higher.\nYes, that's peanuts. So much higher. And others too. I said: \"Here's what we're going to do: reciprocal. Whatever you charge, I'm charging.\" He goes, \"No, no, I don't like that.\" \"No, no, whatever you charge, I'm going to charge.\" I'm doing that with every country.\n[Laughter] It does.\nNobody can argue with me. You know, the media can't argue—I said—they said, \"Tariffs—you're going to charge tariffs?\" You know, if I said, like, 25 percent they'd say, \"Oh, that's terrible.\" I don't say that anymore——\n——because I say, \"Whatever they charge, we'll charge.\" And you know what?\nThey—then they say, \"Oh, that sounds fair.\"\nAnd we're going to make a lot of money, and a lot of businesses are going to come pouring in.\nThey do. Everybody needs us.\nAnd you know what?\nWe only have so long left where we're in this position. We're the bank, and the bank is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. We're the bank. We got to do this now. We can't wait another 10 years and have a shell of a country left, because that's what was going to happen.\nThis country—if I didn't win this election and have people like this man right here that really do care, because that's the other word—if you don't care, you could be the smartest guy in the world, it's not going to matter. But if we didn't win this election, I'm telling you, we would not have had a country for very long.\nWell, potentially, very quickly, between what he's doing and with income coming in from tariffs and other things. I mean, I hope we can—I don't want to give a date, because then these people are going to say, \"Oh, well, he didn't make the date.\" But I think we can do it very quickly.\nWe would have never done it if this didn't happen. Never. It would have never been—it would only get worse and worse, and ultimately, it would have exploded.\nThis country was headed down a very bad track. And the whole DEI thing, that was a trap. That was a sick trap.\nAnd you know, we've destroyed that. That's gone—that's pretty much gone.\nRight.\nEurope takes advantage of us.\nThere could be nothing bigger. There's nothing——\nThat's peanuts.\nThat's peanuts compared to what we're talking about.\nYes.\nIncluding his ships.\nIncluding his ships going up.\nNothing. There's nothing left.\nWell, he doesn't do this kind of thing. And the way I figured that you'd get to know him is if I did it with him. I said, \"Come on, let's do it together.\" He doesn't do this.\nI think he's smarter not doing it, overall. Because, you know, I mean, he's done very well without doing it. But he doesn't feel it's really worthwhile. He wants the product to speak for itself, or whatever he does speak for itself. But he views it as—you know, does it matter?\nAnd I'm doing this with you today because I wanted to have people understand him. And I think it's very important—I disagree with him. I think it's very important that they do understand him.\nHe doesn't need this. He doesn't need it. Now, I happen to think it's made him very popular. I think it—he's more popular now because there are so many people—you know, you're talking about the radical left—they have the lowest ratings. MSNBC is dying. CNN is dying. They're all dying. The New York Times is doing lousy. The Washington Post is doing horribly. They're all doing badly because people don't buy it anymore.\nBut I think it was important that he do this one interview. You've been a very fair guy. I think you were the right guy to do it. If we could get some radical left guy—and he'd do just as well, frankly, because it's all about common sense.\n——to me this was a—it was important for people to understand, he's doing a big job. He's doing a very thankless job. He's doing a thankless job, but he's helping us to save our country.\nOur country was in serious trouble, and I had to get the best guy, somebody with credibility, because if he were just a regular, good—very good, solid businessman, he wouldn't have the credibility. He's got the best credibility for this.\nAnd people also know he's an honest guy. He's an honest guy. He's just a very, very smart guy who's done amazing things. And this will be the biggest thing he's ever done, because, you know, his companies are all great. But if this country goes bad—I guess where he is a little selfish is this. He knows one thing and probably doesn't think—but if his—if this country goes bad, his stuff is not going to be worth very much, I can tell you.\nAll good statements.\nYou mean by that all good statements. Look, they respect the President of this country. They respect—they did not respect the last President. They laughed at him, and they laughed at our country, and he's done great damage to our country.\nYes, they have, but I'd rather not say. They have. It's not—it—look—\nHe was not George Washington, let's put it that way.\nNot the greatest.\nHe's done a tremendous disservice.\nActually, you mention John.\nHe's become the best voice in the Democrat party. You know, I had lunch with him, and I thought he was terrific, but he's a much different man than he was before he had this difficulty. He used to be radical left, and I think he became much smarter, actually. He's really—he's really a voice of reason.\nBut the Democrats have to get together. They have to get their act together, because the stuff they—they talk about makes no sense. It makes—none whatsoever. And they must know it. They must know.\nThat's a good question. I mean, I was thinking about that just now. I said, \"I wonder how long he's going to be doing it.\" You can't get somebody like this. He cares, and he's brilliant, and he's got energy.\nYou need energy, also, in addition to those other things.\nYou know, I have a lot of guys that are very smart, but they have no energy. They want to sleep all day long. You need a lot of energy. He's got a lot of energy. He's doing a great job.\nIf there's any conflict, he will stop it. But if he didn't, I'd stop it. I'd see if there's a conflict. I mean, we're talking about big stuff.\nBut he's under a pretty big microscope.\nI mean, everybody is watching him. If there's a conflict, you're going to be reading about it within about 2 minutes after the conflict.\nAnd you're going to ask the other side, when they talk about, \"This is a constitutional crisis,\" you've got to a—what are they paying for? Where are those tax—because when you read off the list of things, it's a big con job. See, when they talk Constitution——\n——it's a total con job.\n——and all the stuff in some country that nobody ever heard of, they don't want to talk about it. They just talk about, \"This is a constitutional crisis.\"\nThe money is being squandered purposely—tremendous theft, tremendous kickbacks, everything—and we're straightening it out. And thank goodness. I look up, and I say, \"Thank you,\" because I think if it went on for 4 more years, it would not be salvageable. You wouldn't be able——\nYou wouldn't be able to save it.\nYes.\nThank you very much.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/interview-with-sean-hannity-the-fox-news-channels-sean-hannity-show"}

{"Title": "The President's News Conference With President Emmanuel Macron of France", "Date": "2025-02-24", "Text": "Well, thank you very much, everyone. Great honor to be here with my friend.\nI'm delighted to welcome President Macron back to the White House. We've been together quite often, but not that often in the White House. We honored the President, First Lady of France not so long ago. That was a beautiful evening, and we will not soon forget it. That was a beautiful day and evening and many fond memories.\nI also want to thank Emmanuel for hosting me in Paris last December after a historic election win to witness the reopening of the spectacular Notre Dame Cathedral, where you did an outstanding job in bringing it back together. That was a sad day, watching that burn. And 5 years later, you had it up, and it was, they say, more beautiful than it was before. So I think that's a great achievement. That was not easy.\nFrance is America's oldest ally. Our cherished partnership has been a force for freedom, prosperity, and peace from the very beginning. We're now working on some very interesting developments—one, in particular, as you know, the war between Russia and Ukraine.\nIn the American Revolution, French support helped us to seize our destiny as an independent nation. In the first and second World Wars, our citizens shed blood together on the battlefields of Europe. And I'll never forget joining President Macron 6 years ago on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. That was some day.\nThe purpose of our meeting today is to end another battle, a really horrible one—a war, something that we haven't seen since the Second World War—that is ravaging European soil. The deadliest and most destructive conflict that one can imagine. I've seen the pictures. I've seen the satellite photos and—and lots of other photos, and it's a horrible thing that's happening. Thousands of people are dying a week.\nThis very day is the third anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, which would never have happened if I was President. That was not going to happen. The horrors of this gruesome and bloody war can scarcely be overestimated. Hundreds of thousands of people—Russians and Ukrainians, in particular—have needlessly died. An entire generation of Ukrainians and Russian men has been decimated. One-thousand-year-old cities have been turned into rubble. Those beautiful spires that you used to see there—they were the most beautiful in the world, they say—are lying in heaps of rubble, blasted to smithereens.\nAnd it's time to end this bloodletting and restore peace, and I think we're going to do it. We've had some great conversations, including with Russia. Since my return to the White House, we've made more progress toward that goal in 1 month than occurred in the past 3 years.\nAnd I've spoken with both President Putin and President Zelenskyy. And, again, a lot of—a lot of good things toward peace are happening, moving it, I think, pretty quickly.\nLast week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff conducted successful talks in Saudi Arabia with the delegation from Russia, and I'd like to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the King and Muhammad. Great people. They're really working hard to get this done.\nOur focus is on achieving a cease-fire as soon as possible and ultimately a permanent peace. My meeting with President Macron today was another important step forward in that—well, that sphere, because he's been very much involved, right from the beginning, on trying to get it over with, and we're going to get it done.\nI believe that Emmanuel agrees with me on many of the most important issues. Chief among them is, this is the right time. It may be the only time.\nYou know, that's a very interesting and horrible situation, and that could evolve into a third world war. We're not going to let that happen. It should have never started, but it did, and what a mess. What a horrible, bloody mess.\nI'm also pleased that President Macron agrees that the cost and burden of securing the peace must be borne by the nations of Europe, not alone by the United States. And Europe must take that central role in assuring long-term security of Ukraine, which they want to do. And that's not a very big step. A big step is what's going to happen over the next few weeks.\nThe United States has put up far more aid for Ukraine than any other nation, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've spent more than $300 billion, and Europe has spent about $100 billion. That's a big difference. And at some point, we should equalize. But hopefully, won't—won't have to worry about that. We have other things happening that maybe take that out of the realm of necessity.\nAnd while we've given vast amounts of military aid and money in form of grants, much of Europe's contribution has been economic relief structured as loans, for which they'll be repaid. Like the Europeans, I believe that taxpayers and the United States also deserve to recoup the colossal amounts of money that we've sent. The previous administration never even thought of that. They didn't think of a lot of things, like why did they let it start in the first place.\nThat is why we must have an agreement with Ukraine on critical minerals and rare earths and various other things as security. And I think that that's happening. I think we've made a lot of progress. I had a report just given to me before walking in that we've made, Emmanuel, a great deal of progress toward getting that.\nI've been elected by the American people to restore common sense to Washington and, indeed, to the world. And I believe strongly that it's in the best interest of the United States, the best interest in Europe, the best interest of Ukraine, and indeed, the best interest of Russia to stop the killing now and bring the world to peace.\nMy administration is making a decisive break with the foreign policy failures of the past administration and, frankly, the past. I ran against a very foolish foreign policy establishment, and their recklessness has led to the death of many, many people.\nUnder our administration, we're forging a new path that promotes peace around the world. And when I left office for the first administration—first term, we had no wars. We had no problems. We didn't have October 7 with Israel. We didn't have Russia and Ukraine going at it. We didn't have the problems in other parts of the Middle East. We didn't have inflation. It was a whole different world.\nAnd you know what else we didn't have? Millions of people pouring through our borders, many of them criminals released from other nations and put right into our land: murderers and drug dealers, gangs. We didn't have any of that. It's a different time.\nBut now we have it, and we're fixing it. We'll fix it all up. We'll get it done as quickly as possible.\nAnd we've made a great deal of progress. People are saying it was the best month for a President in our country's history. I hope that's right, but—I feel it's right. We've—we've done a lot of things in a very short period of time, 4 weeks.\nAs I've said before, it's my hope that my greatest legacy, however, will be as a peacemaker and a unifier. I want to bring peace, not war.\nI thank President Macron for joining us today in this urgent work we're doing. And we have some wonderful people up front right here that have worked so hard. Steve Witkoff, thank you very much. Michael Waltz, thank you. Scott, thank you very much. And, J.D., thank you. They've really done a—they've really done a job. They worked very hard. It's like—it's a real passion to get this war ended.\nAnd I'd like to now invite Emmanuel to say a few words, and then we'll take questions. And, again, Emmanuel, it's a great honor to have you with us at the White House. Thank you very much. Please.\nThank you very much. Thank you, Emmanuel. Thank you very much.\n[President Macron spoke briefly in English as follows.]\nGreat job.\nOkay. Thank you very much.\nBrian [Brian Glenn, America's Real Voice], would you like to ask a question? Go ahead.\nYes.\nWell, I was honored by it. It was a big poll, and it's usually a poll that leans on the other side of things, the other side of the world, so to speak. But the Harvard poll is a respected poll, and it has us not only leading, but leading by a lot and leading on every single issue that we've talked about.\nAnd as I said, we've become the party of common sense, and I think that's a very important element now—common sense—because what's happening in the world and even in this country, some of the things that took place, many of them are now canceled, and the rest are being canceled as we speak. But we've moved very rapidly and, I think, very effectively.\nSo I was honored by that poll. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nGo ahead. Please go ahead.\nRussia/Ukraine/U.S. Diplomatic Efforts in Saudi Arabia\nYes.\nGo ahead.\nYes, I think the meeting in Saudi Arabia was a fantastic one. We met with the Crown Prince, who is just a fantastic young guy. He's young, but with great imagination and tremendously respected all over the world. And he goes right to the King, and the King is incredible. I've gotten to be friends with both of them very much. And they want to see this ended, and they're going all out to make sure that it is ended.\nI think Russia, likewise—I've spoken to President Putin, and my people are dealing with him constantly and his people, in particular. And they want to do something. I mean, that's what I do. I do deals. My whole life is deals. That's all I know is deals. And I know when somebody wants to make it and when somebody doesn't.\nI will say this. Before I came here, there was no communication with Russia whatsoever, and Russia wasn't answering calls. They were not talking to anybody. They wouldn't talk to anybody. And people sort of accepted that as being that they want to go forward and just keep going without stop. But when I got here, one of the first calls I made was to President Putin, and we were treated with great respect.\nAnd they want to end this war. So that's a big thing, because I didn't know if I could say that, but it's a big thing. They want to do it. And the group in the front row that I introduced, they are very—all very active in it. And we're working on deals right now, transactions right now.\nAnd, in particular, the big one is to get the—the war stopped, whether it's ceasefire or direct to an agreement. I'd like to go directly to an agreement, but cease-fire will always happen a little bit quicker. And every day, you're saving thousands or at least hundreds—but thousands, in some cases—lives, so we want to see if we can get that done very quickly.\n[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nYes, for the President, please.\nYes. I think it's very much to the benefit of Russia to make a deal, and I feel that we'll do that. It is what it is.\nAgain, it's a war that should have never been started. It's a war that would not have been started if I were President, but it did start, and it's at a terrible level, where cities are burned down and shot down to the ground. It looks like demolition sites, a whole big pile of demolition sites. And we got to get it stopped. Too many people, too much agony. The whole culture is destroyed, when you rip down some of those ancient—really ancient or near-ancient buildings. It's so sad to see.\nBut I think it's very much to the benefit of—there's tremendous distrust on both sides. That's why it's good that I'm coming in now. But I think it's to the very much benefit of Russia to make a deal and to go on with—go on with leading Russia in a very positive way. That's what you have to do.\nBut I really believe that he wants to make a deal. May be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.\n[Several reporters began asking questions at once.]\nWe're on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that's moving along very rapidly. We've been mistreated very badly by many countries, not just Canada and Mexico. We've been taken advantage of. We were led by, in some cases, fools, because anybody that would sign documents like they signed, where they were able to take advantage of the American people, like has happened over the last long period of time, except for a little 4-year period that took place 4 years ago—but anybody that would agree to allow this to happen to our country should be ashamed of themselves.\nNo, the tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule. This is an abuse that took place for many, many years. And I'm not even blaming the other countries that did this. I blame our leadership for allowing it to happen. I mean, you know, who can blame them if they made these great deals with the United States, took advantage of the United States on manufacturing, on just about everything? Every aspect that you can imagine, they took advantage of. I look at some of these agreements, I'd read them at night, and I'd say, \"Who would ever sign a thing like this?\"\nSo the tariffs will go forward, yes. And we're going to make up a lot of territory. We're going to—all we want is reciprocal. We want reciprocity. We want to have the same. So, if somebody charges us, we charge them. It's very simple. But it will be very good for our country. Our country will be extremely liquid and rich again.\nPlus, we're doing other things, as you know. We're finding tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse at levels that nobody thought possible. You're seeing what's going on.\nAnd that was also part of the Harvard poll: Do you agree with what President Trump is doing with Elon and others that are looking for the waste, fraud, and abuse? And the numbers were staggering. It was, like, 70 percent to 2 percent. Everybody wants to find out. They don't like it.\nAnd you know, the radical left or whoever it may be starts screaming about the Constitution, but it has nothing to do with the Constitution. It has to do with fairness to this country. It has to do with being ripped off. And when you read the things that all of these billions and—and I mean many billions, hundreds of billions of dollars—has—have been spent on, that's all you have to do is stand up here and read them. I could stand up all day and read the kind of things where we're spending all of this money.\nThe good news is that when you think of how rich a nation we can be when we get rid of this. You know, sometimes you'll buy a company, and you'll see it was really well run. It's—they accounted for every penny. Well, not much you can do there. You've got yourself a bad deal. This one is the exact opposite. Tremendous fraud, tremendous waste. And—when you think of what it is—you know, Elon uses an expression, \"caring.\" If we had people that cared, just cared a little bit when they did contracts, when they negotiated with outside vendors for—on behalf of the United States.\nThat's what I'm doing now. I'm negotiating for the people of the United States. So, we're doing a great job of it, I will say. We've found—it will be hundreds of billions of dollars of—of waste and fraud and abuse.\nThank you. Please.\n[President Macron spoke in English as follows.]\nOkay. Please. Go ahead. To the President, please.\nUkraine/U.S. Security Assistance/Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France\nWell, I guess it's a little strange question, because you ask whether or not we're going to, on behalf of the United States, contribute to Ukraine. I mean, we're in there for about $350 billion. I think that's a pretty big contribution.\nI do appreciate the first part of your question, however, because I think they've done an incredible job with the Cathedral of Notre Dame. I think the President has done—I know he headed it up, and I know he—how hard he worked, and it took a period of time but really not a long period of time, considering what that was. So delicate, so beautiful.\nAnd I was there, and I saw the work. And I'm very good at construction. I know good construction, and I know bad construction. They did a beautiful job, and this man has to be given a lot of credit for that. It's an incredible cathedral. Most people thought it couldn't be saved, and, if it was, it would have to be built in a different form. And we didn't want to see a different form. We wanted to see the same form that you built.\nSo I just want to congratulate you. That was an amazing job. I don't think you've gotten enough credit for it. Someday you will. Someday you will.\nEmmanuel, thank you very much. Great job. And it's been wonderful being with you.\nSay hello to your beautiful wife, and we will see you again soon. We'll be speaking often, and we'll get this thing worked out. We're going to get it done. So important. And great job.\nThank you. Thank you very much.\n[Several reporters spoke at once.]\nThank you. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-emmanuel-macron-france-1"}
{"Title": "The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the United Kingdom", "Date": "2025-02-27", "Text": "Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great honor.\nToday, it's my privilege to welcome the Prime Minister of a very special place, the United Kingdom, to the White House. Prime Minister Starmer, you've been terrific in our discussions. You're a very tough negotiator, however. [Laughter] I'm not sure I like that, but that's okay. [Laughter] Very, very special person.\nThe Prime Minister and I have gotten off to an outstanding start. The U.S. and U.K. have a special relationship—very special; really, like no other—passed down through the centuries, and we're going to keep it that way. We're going to keep it very strong, as it is.\nVery importantly, I was just notified by letter from King Charles that he's extended, through the Prime Minister, a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom, and that's a great honor because it's never happened before. One person has never been extended that honor, and I really do call it an honor. But it's not for me. It's for our country. It's respect for our country. So I just want to thank you, and I want to thank King Charles. Thank you very much.\nAnd we accept. [Laughter] I don't know if the media is going to follow us. I have a feeling they might. Okay? Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nI'm pleased to say that the bust of one of the Prime Minister's greatest predecessors, Winston Churchill, is now back in the rightful place in the Oval Office, and we're very proud of it.\nOur meeting today and the various breakout sessions we had were tremendously productive. Most importantly, I provided the Prime Minister with an update on our efforts to end the bloody and horrible war in Ukraine with Russia, which would never have happened if I were President— that was not going to happen. I promise you that.\nAfter 3 years of hellacious conflict, approximately 1 million Ukrainians and Russians have been senselessly killed. But the number, I believe, is much higher than that. Countless schools, hospitals, towns, and beautiful ancient churches have been absolutely obliterated.\nTo begin the process of ending this spiral of death, I had historic back-to-back calls with President Putin—very successful calls, I might add—and President Zelenskyy, and my team also spoke with the Secretary General of NATO on numerous occasions, and we're working very hard to get that war brought to an end. I think we've made a lot of progress, and I think it's moving along pretty rapidly.\nAnd I want to thank all of the people that are here that have been working on it, and we'll let you know what's—what happens. It will either be fairly soon, or it won't be at all.\nIn addition, this week, I met with President Macron of France, as you know, and held talks with members of the G-7.\nTomorrow the progress toward peace will continue when President Zelenskyy visits the White House. He'll be here tomorrow in the early part of the day, and we'll be signing a historic agreement that will make the United States a major partner in developing Ukraine's minerals and rare earths and oil and gasses. And we have a great understanding. I think it's going to be great for Ukraine.\nAnd we're going to be at the site, and we'll be digging. We'll be dig, dig, digging. Dig, we must. A big utility in New York, Con Edison, they used to have a saying, \"Dig we must.\" And we will be digging.\nBut much of the European aid to Ukraine has been sent in the form of loans, for which they expect to be paid back, and we didn't have that honor under the Biden administration. He sent money—would just send it, money after money after money—and never had any knowledge of ever seeing it back: maybe 300 to 350 billion dollars.\nBut under the breakthrough agreement, very unusual, which everyone said was difficult to get—but it's really very good for Ukraine and very good for us—the American taxpayers will now effectively be reimbursed for the money and hundreds of billions of dollars poured into helping Ukraine defend itself, which, by and of itself, is a very worthy thing to do.\nWe've paid far more than any other country, and with most of our support, it's been paid in military—the finest weapons anywhere in the world. This includes vast amounts of military hardware, ammunition, and various other things that we now have to start rebuilding our own stockpiles.\nAdditionally, the minerals agreement will provide the basis for a more sustainable future relationship between the United States and Ukraine and thus stimulate the long-term prosperity that will help the Ukrainians rebuild their country. It's been demolished, and the ruined infrastructure—the infrastructure, as you know, is in very bad shape.\nIn just over 1 month, our administration has already achieved more progress toward peace than years in the other administration, where they did nothing toward peace. They didn't understand what was happening.\nOur approach is basically common sense. As I said, so many of the things that we do are based on common sense. If you want peace, you have to talk—both sides.\nAs I discussed with Prime Minister Starmer, the next step we're making is toward a very achievable cease-fire. We hope that that can happen quickly, because thousands of young people—in this case, they—we're not talking about Americans; we're talking about Ukrainians and Russians—are being killed every week. Thousands.\nAnd it's a rough battlefield. It's a flat piece of land, and the bullet only stops when it hits somebody.\nAnd this week, I saw the reports, and it's—I don't even want to say what they are, but thousands of people—young people—young, vibrant people died. And we want to stop that senseless—should have never happened.\nThis will lay the groundwork for a long-term peace agreement that will return stability to Eastern Europe and, hopefully, ensure that such a terrible war will never happen on European soil or, for that matter, anywhere again. It's a horrible thing that's going on.\nThe disaster in Ukraine shows exactly why it's so important for the United Kingdom and other NATO partners to make large investments in their defense capabilities. In many cases, 4 percent or 5 percent of GDP would be appropriate. I know that they're raising it. I just read an article, a great article about the work you're doing in the U.K., as to the military. You're raising it quite a bit, which is a great thing to do for your country.\nIt's great thing to do. It's sad that we need that, but probably need that. So, congratulations on that. I know you got it through.\nAfter years of chronic underfunding, there's an urgent need to catch up for some countries. And I want to thank the Prime Minister once again for traveling here today. Working together, I believe that we'll once again demonstrate the power of our countries' unique friendship. This is indeed a unique friendship. It's been many years, and I think it's only gotten stronger, and we will make sure that it stays that way.\nWe're going to have a great trade agreement. One way or the other, we're going to end up with a very good trade agreement for both countries, and we're working on that as we speak. I think we'll have the confines—I think we'll have something maybe even in terms of possibilities agreed to very shortly. J.D. is working on it, our Vice President, and Scott. And I'm just looking at this whole—Mike, you're going to work on it. Everyone's going to work on it. We'll see if we can do something pretty quickly.\nBut we're going to make some great trade agreements with the U.K. and with the Prime Minister, and it'll happen very quickly.\nSo I just want to thank you again. And please thank King Charles for the invite, and I look forward to you giving our acceptance on behalf of the United States of America. Thank you very much, sir.\nThank you very much.\nGreat. Great to see you.\nThank you.\nThat's right.\nThank you very much. What a beautiful accent. [Laughter] I would have been President 20 years ago if I had that accent. [Laughter]\nThank you. Very good to see you.\nWe'll take a couple of questions.\nSo I'll go ahead—the first part. The tariffs are necessary because we've been treated very unfairly by many, many countries, including our friends—friend and foe. But we've been treated very unfairly in trade at levels that nobody has really ever seen before. And especially under the Biden administration, they really took advantage of the United States.\nI put massive tariffs on China during my 4 years. We had the best economy in the history of our country. One—probably the best economy—maybe the best economy in the history of the world. And I had—I used tariffs to even things up. And in particular, with China, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars. And we had no inflation.\nAnd it's a myth. It's a myth that's put out there by foreign countries that really don't like paying tariffs and—especially to even up. So we've been treated badly by a lot. We're using tariffs.\nAnd I find—and you just have to look at the numbers, but I find that it's not about inflation; it's about fairness. And the inflation, for us, has not existed, and I don't think it's going to exist.\nWe're going to bring our car industry back. We're going to bring our chips back. We're going to bring so many things back to our country, including pharmaceuticals and drugs.\nAnd the thing that's going to get us there is tariffs. And I say often it's my favorite word in the dictionary, but I always preface that by saying now—because I got into a lot of trouble with the fake news where they say, \"That's not good.\" So I say, God, love, family, wife, they're all my favorite words—[laughter]—but tariff is about number four or five on the list. [Laughter]\nBut I will tell you, it's going to make our country rich, and it's going to stop us from being a laughing stock all over the world, because we have been taken advantage of like no country has ever been taken advantage of.\nThank you very much. And—[inaudible]—answer.\nThat's enough. Thank you.\nHi.\nWell, they didn't do well with President Obama. He never got a lot of things done, and he didn't get a trade deal done that was of any importance or magnitude. We have—we've had great discussions on trade, and I think we're going to have a deal done rather quickly—as quickly as it can be done. We'll—we're going to have something, I think, rather quickly. We expect to do that. Okay?\nJeff [Jeff Mason, Reuters], go ahead.\nI support it. I don't think we're going to have any reason for it. I think we're going to have a very successful peace, and I think it's going to be a long-lasting peace. And I think it's going to happen, hopefully, quickly. It—if it doesn't happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\nAnd we want it for two reasons. Number one, I want to see—on a humane basis, I want to see soldiers stop getting shot, because, largely, it's soldiers now. Towns have been obliterated. But it's largely that.\nAnd I don't want to pay billions and billions and billions of dollars, nor does the Prime Minister or anybody else, on a senseless war that should have never happened. And we're going to get it taken care of. But I think it's going to be a peace that's going to be long-lasting.\nDo you have a question for the Prime Minister?\nOkay. Please, blue.\nWell, we're never going to know that answer but by our being in Ukraine and doing the exploration and also the digging and taking the rare earth, which we need in our country very badly. We'll be doing a substantial amount of work, probably about—at least what we have in there, and we hope to be able to do that.\nYou never know when it comes to that. You know, you dig, and maybe things aren't there like you think they're there. But we'll be spending a lot of time there. It will be great for Ukraine. It's like a huge economic development project. So it will be good for both countries. Okay?\nAnd I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow—11 o'clock. And I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. We're going to get along really well. Okay? We have a lot of respect. I have a lot of respect for him.\nWe've given them a lot of equipment and a lot of money, but they have fought very bravely, no matter how you figure. They have really fought. Somebody has to use that equipment, and they have been very brave in that sense.\nYes, please. Go ahead.\nSo we're working very hard on the Middle East and Gaza and all of the problems, and it's been going on for years and years and centuries and centuries. It's a— tough neighborhood, but it could be a very beautiful neighborhood, and I think we're going to come up with some pretty good solutions.\nBut phase one is almost complete. We've had some people that have been very seriously injured, very seriously hurt—both physically and mentally. They've come out of there very, very—and some of them in very, very bad shape. It's shocking—many young people. Young people aren't in bad shape. Young people are strong, healthy. They don't die. People have come out dead—young people and old people.\nIt's a rough situation, but I think we're going to make it much better. And I think that we've had a huge impact on that since we've been in just the 4 weeks. I think we've had a huge impact on Gaza, the Middle East, and we have some pretty good talks going on, concerning lots of other people that are going to make it better.\nSo we'll see what happens. Nobody really knows, but we'll see what happens. But I think we've had a very positive impact.\nThank you. Yes, in the red, please.\nPink-red. Flaming red.\nGo ahead.\nYes, thank you very much. We're open to many things, but before I even think about that—that's almost pleasant to think about, because that would mean that peace has been arrived at. We have to arrive at that peace.\nAnd you know, you went 3½ years with an administration that never even really had a meeting—they didn't have a meeting on peace, and there was no prospect of peace.\nI think, frankly, Russia wanted to go through the whole long deal. I don't think they do anymore. I don't think they do. We had a very big impact on that whole situation.\nBut I don't like talking about phase two until I get phase one. Phase one is, I have to make peace. And we have to get Russia to agree. We have to get Ukraine to agree. And I think we will. I think we've come a long way. I believe we're going to get it done. I wouldn't say that if I didn't think so. And I think it will be very important, very historic, and we're going to save a lot of lives.\nAnd think of that, she came home with her fingers and part of her hand blown off.\nYes. How bad does it get? And we had others that came home in much, much worse shape than that.\nIt's a terrible situation.\nHe tried. [Laughter] He was working hard, I'll tell you that. [Laughter] He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there. [Laughter] But he tried.\nWe—I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.\nBut he's—he earned whatever they—whatever they pay him, he earned today. He was working hard at lunch. [Laughter] And I'm very receptive to it.\nI think we—in all fairness, in all seriousness, I think we have a very good chance at arriving in a very good deal. J.D. and—Scott and Howard—all the people are working on it, and I think we have a good chance at arriving at a deal that could be terrific—really terrific for both countries.\nOkay? Thank you.\nI think we'll have two deals. I think we'll have a deal on ending the war, and I think we're going to end up with a great trade deal with you.\nAnd it's an honor to be with you.\nAnd I want to thank everybody very much. Thank you very much.\nThank you very much. Thank you.", "Link": "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-keir-starmer-the-united-kingdom"}
